Dividend stocks  continue to be the focus for many investors, as companies that pay out dividends tend to have more stable cash flows and growth profiles over the long term. Personally, I like to look at companies that pay dividends for core portfolio holdings for this reason alone. However, there are plenty of other factors to consider aside from dividends. Investors want to know a given company will grow over time and is valued fairly. Those factors mean many dividend-paying stocks may not be as attractive as they initially look. That said, here are three of the top dividend stocks I’m focusing on in the market right now. These companies have the right mix of income, growth and value I think most long-term investors want to see.  Restaurant Brands Restaurant Brands  ( TSX:QSR ) is a global network of quick-service restaurants. The company registered system-wide sales of more than $35 billion for 2021 across 100 countries and 28,000 restaurants. It generates retail sales from company-owned restaurants, royalty fees and lease income from franchised stores. Notably, this company is the parent of world-class banners Burger King, Tim Hortons, Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, and Firehouse Subs. For investors looking for solid dividend-paying companies with the kind of earnings growth that justifies investing in such names, this is a top stock in my books. The company’s yield of 3.2% is relatively low, but it is supported by a strong history of dividend growth — one I think will continue for a long period of time. As Restaurant Brands continues to grow globally (with plans to open 7,000 new restaurants over the next five years), I think there’s a solid growth profile as well to consider with this name. At just 18 times earnings, QSR stock certainly looks cheap at current levels. Long-term investors will want to continue adding to this name right now, at least in my view.  Fortis Fortis  ( TSX:FTS )   operates and owns 10 distribution assets and utility transmissions in Canada and the United States. The company serves approximately 3.4 million customers in this region and has smaller stakes in multiple Caribbean utilities and electricity generation. The company has a defensive appeal and offers quarterly dividends to investors, making it one of the most magnificent dividend stocks to invest in April 2024. Fortis is among the most stable dividend stocks in the market, raising its distribution for 50 consecutive years. This factor makes the company’s 4.2% dividend yield much more attractive. And when considering the company’s very low beta of 0.17 (it doesn’t move in line with the market, in general), that’s the kind of defensive option investors who are worried about incoming macro uncertainty will want to consider.  Over the long term, I think Fortis remains a great core portfolio holding choice. This is a dividend stock I’d buy in May and hold forever.  Bank of Nova Scotia Bank of Nova Scotia  ( TSX:BNS ) is a Canadian banking giant offering financial services worldwide. The bank has five business segments: Canadian banking, global markets and banking, international banking, global wealth management and others. It offers a comprehensive range of products, services and advice involving commercial and personal banking, private banking, wealth management, and more.  The bank’s unique footprint in Central and Latin America showcases its growth globally and proves a unique contention for Canadian investors to consider. Over the past few years, investors who held this stock for the long term have earned consistent returns through the ups and downs of the market. Much of that has to do with Scotiabank’s 6.5% yield, which well outpaces bonds right now. This company certainly provides cyclical exposure to the market, so I think it’s best held in a portfolio padded with other more defensive stocks (such as the last two picks). That said, for those looking to amplify their income over time, this is a top pick to consider."},

Shares are back trading near all-time highs and looking to climb even further. But if you’re looking for more returns in 2024, is it too late to buy  Royal Bank of Canada  ( TSX:RY )? What happened? Over the last few months, RBC stock has climbed as the company continued to demonstrate its strength as the country’s largest bank. Not only was it able to cut back on provisions for loan losses, its most lucrative sector climbed higher. That’s the wealth and commercial management sector, which RBC stock has long demonstrated is its core performer. And this recently became even more true as the company expanded through the acquisition of HSBC Canada. The acquisition won’t just bring in new clients but high-income newcomers to Canada. While costly, it’s quite clear that the benefits far outweigh the costs. And could indeed see the company become even more ahead of the rest in terms of size. Earnings rising higher As mentioned by management, RBC stock has set itself up with the “right strategy in place to grow today while also generating long-term value for shareholders.” And this has been demonstrated time and again through earnings. We can see this by narrowing our focus onto the last few quarters and identifying some strong momentum. During the third quarter of 2023, net income came in at $3.9 billion for RBC stock, with diluted earnings per share (EPS) at $2.73. Total provisions for credit losses (PCL) came to $616 million as well. By the fourth quarter, net income climbed to $4.13 billion, with diluted EPS at $2.90. Total PCLs also rose to $720 million, only slightly increasing compared to its counterparts. When the first quarter came around, net income shrank back to $3.6 billion, with diluted EPS at $2.50 and total PCL climbing higher to $813 million. Yet shares jumped from earnings, as the company reported a strong bottom line, with higher profits compared to estimates on higher interest and fees income. What to watch RBC stock is now lying gin wait for the time in which the economy starts to shift. The company continues to gain some confidence around the markets, with interest rates now stabilizing and investors merely waiting for that moment when the first cut comes. And don’t forget, while the company has put aside PCLs, it doesn’t mean that the stock will lose money on those lose necessarily. In fact, even just last year the company predicted a recession would come in the summer, and never transpired. So, instead, it’s taken a “better safe than sorry” approach that is now paying off. When rates start to fall then, RBC stock expects that the company will be able to capture capital markets revenue. This should certainly help the market and RBC stock, as there will likely be a ramp up from acquisitions and loan-taking. Overall, RBC stock has had a strong start to the year. And as interest rates come down, it looks well positioned to end 2024 even stronger, especially when there is a  dividend  yield of 3.86% to consider."},

Well, there’s one on the  Toronto Stock Exchange , already hailed as a “millionaire-maker,” that just became even more attractive. Yes, I’m talking about  Shopify  ( TSX:SHOP ), the Ottawa-headquartered e-commerce platform provider that continues to transform online retail for entrepreneurs and businesses worldwide. As Shopify’s stock has yielded some eyepopping returns since its initial public offering in 2015, some investors might wonder if they have missed the boat or if the stock is too expensive to buy now. However, I believe that Shopify still has plenty of room to surge further. Moreover, the recent declines in SHOP stock after its latest earnings report make it even more attractive, which I find  undervalued  at current levels. Before I explain why Shopify could be a great  growth stock  to buy today, let’s take a quick look at some important highlights from its latest earnings report released on May 8. Key highlights from Shopify’s first-quarter earnings report In the quarter ended in March 2024, Shopify’s total revenue  jumped  23% YoY (year over year) to US$1.9 billion. If we adjust this growth for the company’s recent sale of its logistics operations, this revenue growth rate climbs further to an impressive 29% YoY. These solid sales figures reflect Shopify’s expertise in navigating market dynamics despite the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties and high inflation. The Canadian company registered a solid 23% YoY increase in its gross merchandise volume (GMV) last quarter to US$60.9 billion. In general, stronger GMV highlights the increasing volume of commerce being processed through Shopify’s platforms, which is clearly a reflection of strong merchant and consumer engagement. Overall, its first-quarter revenue from merchant solutions and subscription solutions inched up by 20% and 34%, respectively. With the help of these strong topline numbers, Shopify posted adjusted quarterly earnings of US$0.20 per share. These earnings not only showed significant improvement over its adjusted earnings of just US$0.01 per share in the same quarter of the previous year but also exceeded Street analysts’ expectations of US$0.17 per share. Why Shopify stock looks more attractive to buy now Despite reporting solid first-quarter financial results, which also exceeded Street’s estimates, the TSX-listed Shopify stock tanked by 18.5% on May 8, the day it released the earnings report. Since that day, SHOP stock has, in total, lost more than 25% of its value to currently trade at $79.19 per share with a  market cap  of $101.9 billion, which makes it look undervalued based on its long-term growth potential in my opinion. Looking forward, Shopify expects to maintain this positive momentum, with its latest forecasts suggesting high-teen revenue growth in the second quarter. The slight expected decrease in gross margin for the June quarter could be offset by the continued discipline in operating expenses and its commitment to maintaining a robust free cash flow margin. While its latest earnings event might have disappointed some investors, Shopify’s long-term growth outlook still looks highly promising, with its continued strategic focus on enhancing its platform capabilities and expanding its global merchant base. In addition, the company’s strong financial position gives it the flexibility to make some quality acquisitions and invest in technology, which could accelerate its financial growth further. Given these positive factors, the recent sharp dip in SHOP stock could be an opportunity for long-term investors to buy this millionaire-maker growth stock at a bargain."},

The  investing strategy  also has the potential to make you a millionaire through the power of compound interest. However, the journey to $1 million requires patience and a considerable amount of time. The prerequisite to success is always the choice of stocks. Not all dividend stocks are safe, so it would help to evaluate a company and see if it is financially healthy to sustain dividends for decades until you retire. Dividend titan MCAN Mortgage  ( TSX:MKP ) fits the bill not only because it is a dividend titan. The $597.2 million loan company operates under the Trust and Loan Companies Act (Canada) and is regulated by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI). Second, MCAN is also a Mortgage Investment Corporation (MIC) under the Income Tax Act (Canada). It is allowed to deduct dividend payments to shareholders from its taxable income. Furthermore, MCAN’s lending policy is more conservative compared to that of other regulated financial institutions. Businesses MCAN Homes, MCAN Capital, and MCAN Wealth form the entire business. The first provides mortgage solutions for first-time buyers, self-employed individuals, professionals, property investors, and borrowers with credit issues. MCAN Capital assists in real estate investing through construction and commercial loans, private investment funds and real estate investment trusts (REITs). MCAN Wealth focuses on Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, or CDIC, insured term deposit investment solutions. Product offerings include low-risk Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs). Financial performance The lending environment has been tough since 2020, with the global pandemic and the current high interest rate scenario. Still, MCAN has consistently delivered profits in the last four years amid massive headwinds. In 2023, net income climbed 40% to $77.5 million compared to 2022. Management credits the mortgage portfolio growth and higher spread of corporate mortgages for the jump in net income. High net origination volumes, including strong renewals in residential mortgages, contributed to the financial performance. In the first quarter (Q1) of 2024, net income was $23.2 million, consistent with the $23.3 million net income in Q1 2023. Given the current market conditions, MCAN will focus on maintaining a solid net interest margin, managing portfolio maturities, and investing in or expanding the core business in the short to mid-term. “We remain committed to driving sustainable growth and maximizing shareholder value in the long term,” said Don Coulter, chief executive officer (CEO) of MCAN. $1 million potential As of this writing, MKP trades at $15.71 per share and pays a juicy 9.93% dividend. The proposed investment of $53,000 is less than twice the  Registered Retirement Savings Plan  (RRSP) contribution limit in 2024, or $31,560. Based on the allowable RRSP contribution, it would take two years to complete the seed capital. Assuming the dividend yield remains constant, the money invested, on a quarterly compound frequency, will grow to $1,005,174 in 30 years. The quarterly payouts are well covered by earnings, evidenced by the 68.64% payout ratio. Last, a higher investment amount should shorten the investment time frame. MCAN has never missed a quarterly dividend payment since 2012. The best part is that the 9.93% dividend yield is in the top 25% of TSX dividend payers (6.37%)."},

The semiconductor giant is selling shovels amid the artificial intelligence (AI) gold rush as demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) has exploded over the past year. Since the start of 2023, NVDA stock has returned over 500% and is up a staggering 20,000% in the last decade. Valued at US$2.2 trillion by  market cap , Nvidia is among the largest companies on the planet and remains a top investment choice for long-term shareholders. Nvidia is growing rapidly Despite its massive size, Nvidia grew sales in the fiscal fourth quarter (Q4) of 2024 (ended in January) by 265% to US$22.1 billion, while net income rose by 769% to US$12.3 billion. Nvidia’s data centre segment now accounts for 83% of total sales, while the gaming business brought in “just” US$2.8 billion in revenue in the last quarter.  Nvidia’s GPUs are path-breaking and vital to developing AI models such as ChatGPT, providing the tech giant with a wide competitive moat. Priced at 37 times  forward earnings , NVDA stock might seem expensive. However, analysts expect adjusted earnings to almost double in fiscal 2025. In fact, Nvidia stock is forecast to end fiscal 2029 with adjusted earnings of US$63. So, if NVDA stock is priced at 30 times forward earnings, it should touch US$1,890 in May 2028, indicating an upside potential of over 100% from current levels. Is TSM stock a better AI stock to buy? While Nvidia stock remains a compelling investment, you can consider diversifying your AI portfolio by holding other blue-chip stocks, such as  Taiwan Semiconductor  ( NYSE:TSM ). With a market cap of US$788 billion, TSMC recently emphasized that demand for AI-related products is “insatiable.”  In fact, the company expects AI sales to rise by 50% annually and account for 20% of its total sales by 2028. The AI gold rush should also help Taiwan Semiconductor grow its sales between 15% and 20% annually through 2025. TSM recently disclosed revenue in April rose almost 60% to US$7.3 billion, pushing its top-line growth to over 26% in the first four months of 2024. TSM is the largest contactor chip manufacturer globally. It uses its facilities to manufacture chips for other tech giants, including  Apple  and Nvidia, who design their chips but outsource the production to TSM. Over the years, TSM has established itself as an industry-leading chip manufacturer and is expected to produce the next generation (two-nanometre wafers) in 2025. Wall Street expects TSM to grow revenue from US$69.4 billion in 2023 to US$84.6 billion in 2024 and US$103 billion in 2025. Comparatively, adjusted earnings are forecast to expand from US$5.19 per share in 2023 to US$6.26 per share in 2024 and US$7.86 per share in 2025. So, priced at 24 times forward earnings, TSM stock trades at a reasonable valuation. The tech stock should end 2028 with adjusted earnings of US$14 per share. If the stock is priced at 20 times forward earnings, TSM should trade around US$280, indicating an upside potential of almost 90%."},

Investors need to identify companies that are reporting consistent profits and are part of expanding addressable markets, allowing them to increase sales and cash flow across market cycles. Moreover, you can hold these stocks in a TFSA ( Tax-Free Savings Account ) and generate tax-sheltered gains for life. The TFSA is a popular registered account in Canada that can be used to hold various qualified investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds. Here are two Canadian growth stocks I’d stash in a TFSA right now. Shopify stock Valued at US$75 billion by market cap,  Shopify  ( TSX:SHOP ) stock is down 63% from all-time highs, allowing you to buy the dip. Shares fell roughly 16% in a single trading session after the Canadian e-commerce giant announced its first-quarter (Q1) results. After adjusting for the sale of its logistics business, Shopify’s revenue grew by 29% year over year in Q1. Its exit from the low-margin business enabled Shopify to boost its gross margins from 48% to 51% in the last 12 months. Further, its cash flow margin doubled to 12%, indicating Shopify is positioned to benefit from economies of scale and operating leverage going forward. However, investors were not impressed by the company’s forecasts for Q2, where it expects gross margins to fall below 50%. It also expects operating expenses to rise at mid-single-digit percentages in the June quarter compared to Q1. Alternatively, Shopify’s growth story is far from over as it continues to innovate, expand its product suite, and help customers simplify their operations. It is positioned to gain significant traction in the B2B (business-to-business) vertical and several international markets. For instance, its gross merchandise volume in the B2B market soared 130% year over year in Q1, while the metric in international markets was up 38%. International sales currently account for 30% of total sales and will be a key growth driver for Shopify. Shopify is forecast to increase adjusted earnings from US$0.73 per share in 2023 to US$0.98 per share in 2024. Comparatively, revenue is on track to expand from US$7.06 billion to US$8.54 billion in this period. So, SHOP stock is priced at 60 times earnings, which might seem steep. But analysts expect earnings to expand by 52% annually in the next five years. Topicus stock Valued at $9 billion by  market cap ,  Topicus  ( TSXV:TOI ) is a European-based company that offers vertical market software to enterprises in the private and public sectors. It builds, acquires, and manages industry-specific software businesses that provide mission-critical and high-impact software solutions. Despite a challenging macro environment, Topicus increased revenue by 16% and free cash flow by 32% in Q1 of 2024. Analysts expect revenue to rise from $1.66 billion in 2023 to $1.96 billion in 2024. Comparatively, adjusted earnings might grow from $1.3 per share to $2.2 per share in this period. Priced at 52 times  forward earnings , Topicus stock trades at a premium. However, its robust earnings growth should help the tech stock generate outsized gains for shareholders in 2024 and beyond."},

At its peak, TSX tech sector stocks boasted soaring valuations and rapid growth through capital gains. Since then, most tech stocks have fallen far from grace and trade at more reasonable valuations. However, not all TSX tech stocks have a reputation for high volatility and significant risk.  Constellation Software  ( TSX:CSU ) is a tech stock that has been around for a while and has delivered significant returns to its shareholders. As of this writing, Constellation Software stock trades for $3,707.87 per share. Up by 20,161.58% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2006, it has crushed the broader market returns. If you invested $5,000 during its IPO, your shares of Constellations Software stock would be worth over $1 million right now. Boasting a $78.58 billion market capitalization, the Toronto-based firm is a diversified software company and among the largest publicly traded companies in the country.  Where many other tech stocks have delivered multi-fold returns to investors and folded under pressure, Constellation Software remains a tried-and-tested millionaire-maker tech stock. Let’s see why this TSX stock can still be a good holding to consider for your self-directed portfolio. Constellation Software Constellation Software is in the business of acquiring, managing, and building vertical market software businesses. Acting like a venture capitalist firm, it focuses on profitable software companies that offer mission-critical software solutions to enterprises, addressing requirements for customers across various niche markets. By acquiring successful companies with high-growth potential, Constellation Software has managed to drive significant growth for itself, boost the businesses under its banner, and grow shareholder value significantly over the years. The company’s business model puts it in a unique position in the tech sector, allowing it to leverage high customer retention rates and stable cash flows across business cycles. Constellation Software generates revenue through hardware sales and fees from software licenses, professional services, and maintenance services. Constellation Software in 2023 Between the inflationary environment and aggressive key interest rate hikes to combat it, the economy and businesses across the board struggled in 2023. Despite the challenges the broader market faced, Constellation Software posted a stellar performance in 2023. The company’s year-over-year sales increased by 27%. In the same period, its net income increased by 10%. Constellation Software also reported a free cash flow of $1.16 billion for 2023, along with a $1.78 billion operating cash flow. The primary reason for its growth was the $2.6 billion in acquisitions the company made.  However, the tech giant’s free cash flow’s 36% rise did not cover the cost of acquisitions and dividends it paid out. Constellation Software raised debt to acquire the capital for these, increasing its total debt to $3.33 billion, up from $1.97 in the year before. Foolish takeaway Constellation Software is one of the rare tech stocks that pays its shareholders their  dividends . While the stock only boasts a 0.15% dividend yield, Constellation Software stock has increased its payouts for the last 15 years by 11% annually.  Analysts anticipate a 10% increase in its share prices in the next 12 months. While it might not deliver rapid returns through short-term capital gains, it can be an excellent long-term holding for stable growth in your self-directed portfolio."},

And should the loonie weaken even more, there’s one industry that looks as though it could be in for an even rougher ride. While Canada may have made some progress in the last while, there is still a bear case to be made in the words of one analyst. A lack of post-COVID stimulus combined with indebted consumers brought in higher risks from rate hikes. This could lead the  Canadian economy  to fall even further. Population up, and so is housing Demand for housing continues to climb. And while some believed this would be a bubble set to burst, the Canadian housing market and real estate in general have risen for decades and decades. After the pandemic, Canada saw a new swell of newcomers to Canada, and this has continued in 2024. In 2023 alone, the population of Canada grew by an incredible 1.3 million, largely from non-permanent residents. And this certainly was good for the Canadian economy, lifting the  gross domestic product  (GDP) as temporary workers filled jobs lost after the pandemic. However, the economy is now slowing, and high interest rates continue to be a part of our present. And this will certainly have an effect on these non-permanent residents, who may choose to get out of Canada in search of more affordable living at better wages. As population drops, so does real estate Now, if analyst theories prove true, there could be a major population decrease over the next few years. With that will also come lower demand for real estate. Given that a large part of Canada’s economy centres around real estate, this could create a “perfect storm.” What this could amount to is a mass exodus of temporary workers seeking out a better option. And the slow fall in interest rates could be too little, too late. This could be devastating for the future of the Canadian economy. That’s because Canada’s economy depends a fair amount on non-permanent residents and newcomers to Canada to keep our economy running. Should these residents choose to go elsewhere, we could see another lag in the economy that hasn’t been seen since the pandemic, when immigration was put to a halt. Real estate in the crosshairs Granted, this could be great news for Canadians looking to buy a house. As we saw during the pandemic, there suddenly became lower demand for housing, leading to lower housing prices. But these lower prices weren’t good for real estate investors. Lower price mean lower profits, so investors in the real estate market will want to keep an eye on this moving forward. Real estate stocks have now had to deal with higher interest rates, higher inflation, and could very soon deal with lower demand as well. In this case, it would be best to seek out in-demand real estate companies. For instance,  Granite REIT  ( TSX:GRT.UN ) will continue to be a solid option. No matter what has been going on, industrial properties have been in high demand with the ongoing rise in e-commerce and supply-chain demands. And with a dividend yield of 4.65%, it’s a strong investment to consider for the long term. As for the rest of the real estate market, the same cannot be said."},

In the case of  dividend stocks , a lower stock price means a higher dividend yield and more income for investors – given the dividend is sustainable and isn’t expected to be cut. And, of course, you should also expect the business to turn around within a reasonable timeframe. Bank of Nova Scotia  ( TSX:BNS ) stock peaked at approximately $82.50 per share in 2022. Since then, the big dividend stock has come off meaningfully. At $65.53 per share at writing, it is 20% lower than its 2022 peak and offers an eye-popping dividend yield of close to 6.5%.  A stock that acts like a GIC This is a perfect perpetual income-generating opportunity for long-term investors. The risk-free one-year  guaranteed investment certificate  (GIC) offers an interest rate of about 5%. It is risk-free in the sense that it provides principal protection.  The same investment in Bank of Nova Scotia common shares offers about 30% more income, plus future income growth potential. However, investors are taking the risk of the underlying business as well as enduring the stock volatility that comes with it.  Risk vs rewards In recent years, the international bank’s earnings have been more of a rollercoaster ride than for its peers, which is why the stock hasn’t performed as well. This is where the income opportunity comes in, as investors could very well park some money in the stock for juicy income.  For example, during the pandemic in fiscal 2020 year, Bank of Nova Scotia experienced an earnings-per-share (EPS) drop of 21% compared to the other Big Six Canadian bank’s EPS decline average of almost 15%. (If you’re curious, the most resilient of the Big Six was  National Bank of Canada .). Bank of Nova Scotia has riskier assets, given that a good portion of its operations are in developing markets that could experience higher growth but also have higher risk. These markets generally have higher levels of bad loans, especially during economic downturns. In a world of higher interest rates, the BNS stock price momentum remains weak.  A big dividend So, the focus on the stock remains its big dividend. Its trailing-12-month payout ratio is about 74% of earnings. Based on adjusted earnings, its payout ratio is estimated to be about 65% this year. Its dividend is still covered by earnings, but since the normal payout ratio should be about 50% for the big Canadian banks, the bank might decide to freeze its dividend temporarily. This would be a hard decision to make and would depend on when management expects to see a resumption of growth. Investors could view BNS stock similar to a “GIC”. With a long-term investment horizon, it’s hard to lose money from a decline in the stock price seeing as the stock trades at a very reasonable  price-to-earnings ratio  of about 10 today. Its long-term normal multiple is close to 11.  Assuming a conservative EPS growth rate of 5% per year and some valuation expansion to 10.5 times, the stock could still deliver roughly 12% per year over the next five years with more than half of the returns coming from its safe dividend. That would be a solid return for a  blue chip stock  and why I think long-term investors should consider BNS stock for their  diversified portfolios ."},

These stocks can provide a steady and reliable source of income for your  Tax-Free Savings Account  (TFSA), allowing you to benefit from compound growth. And as you might already know, you don’t have to pay any taxes on the dividends, or the capital gains you earn within your TFSA. In this article, I’ll highlight two top Canadian monthly dividend stocks that you can add to your TFSA today to create a stable tax-free income stream. Crombie REIT stock Crombie REIT  ( TSX:CRR.UN ) is a New Glasgow-based open-ended real estate investment trust (REIT) with a  market cap  of $1.4 billion. The trust has a strong portfolio of more than 300 retail and mixed-use properties with an area of roughly 19.2 million square feet. Its stock currently trades at $12.99 per share with about 6% year-to-date losses. Crombie stock offers an impressive 6.9% annualized dividend yield at the current market price and distributes these payouts on a monthly basis. On May 8, the REIT announced its first-quarter results. For the quarter, Crombie  posted  a 5.5% YoY (year-over-year) increase in property revenue to $118.6 million and a 4.1% YoY rise in its operating income to $26.2 million. Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment and inflationary pressures, these optimistic growth figures reflect the company’s robust operational framework and effective property management strategies. Crombie’s long-term growth outlook looks great due mainly to its strategic development projects and ongoing capital improvements. Also, the trust’s continued focus on improving property  fundamentals  through major development projects, like The Marlstone, positions it well to capitalize on tenant demand trends. NorthWest Healthcare Properties REIT stock Northwest Healthcare Properties REIT  ( TSX:NWH.UN ) could be another solid pick for TFSA investors seeking stable and growing monthly dividend income. This Toronto-headquartered REIT owns a high-quality portfolio of healthcare-focused properties across several major markets, including North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. At the end of the March quarter, the company had interests in around 210 income-producing properties with a gross leasable area of 17.4 million square feet. The monthly dividend stock currently has a market cap of $1.3 billion as it trades at $5.33 per share after rallying by 25.4% in the last three months. At this market price, NorthWest stock has a 6.8% annualized dividend yield. In the quarter ended in March 2024, NorthWest’s global occupancy rate  stood  firm at 96.5% with an impressive rent collection rate of 98%, reflecting the REIT’s robust tenant base and effective property management strategies. Also, the weighted average lease expiry was 13.2 years, suggesting sustained long-term revenue potential and financial stability. To add optimism, NorthWest REIT’s same-property net operating income last quarter rose 6% YoY to $88.9 million. As the demand for healthcare real estate continues to surge globally, NorthWest could benefit from its global footprint and focus on high-quality healthcare infrastructure in the years to come. Moreover, the REIT’s sale of non-core properties and effective capital management further boost its long-term earnings growth potential."},

Yet since then, those even semi-interested in the market likely know what semiconductors are. Or if not, they’ve certainly heard of major  semiconductor  stock winner  Nvidia  ( NASDAQ:NVDA ). Shares of Nvidia stock surged in the last year as  artificial intelligence  (AI) interest surged. Because what AI companies need, and will always need, are semiconductors. Yet even without AI, suddenly investors became aware as to just why we need semiconductors in every aspect of our lives. Why semiconductors As mentioned, semiconductors are part of all aspects of our society. In fact, semiconductors are the backbone of modern technology. As technology continues to advance, the demand for semiconductors increases. From smartphones to autonomous vehicles, semiconductors are integral components in a wide array of products and industries. What’s more, it’s not just from AI. With the use of the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and 5G technology, the demand for semiconductors is expected to remain robust. This sustained demand creates a favourable environment for semiconductor companies. Furthermore, the semiconductor industry operates within a complex global supply chain. Certain geopolitical events or disruptions can lead to supply shortages, driving up the prices of semiconductor stocks. Additionally, the consolidation within the industry can provide opportunities for well-positioned companies to capture market share and drive growth. And all this positions investors for long-term growth. But, which semiconductor stocks are the best? Celestica Of all the semiconductor stocks out there, even Nvidia stock couldn’t beat the growth seen by  Celestica  ( TSX:CLS ) in the last year. Shares of CLS stock are up 344% in the last year at the time of writing this article. All thanks to semiconductor stock interest. The company is an electronics manufacturing services (EMS) company, providing a range of manufacturing services and solutions to global customers in various industries, including aerospace and defence, automotive, communications, computing, healthcare, industrial, and semiconductor. What’s more, the company continues to look valuable even with a higher share price.  The company recently reported its first quarter, increasing its full-year guidance for 2024 far above expectations. Overall, CLS stock simply looks like a well-managed, solid semiconductor stock with a strong long-term outlook. So don’t let that 344% scare you off. There could certainly be more to come. BlackBerry Former meme-stock and smartphone maker  BlackBerry  ( TSX:BB ) is another long-term winner in the semiconductor industry, especially for its interest in QNX software. While BlackBerry stock isn’t a semiconductor manufacturer itself, it has had a significant relationship with the semiconductor industry, particularly in its earlier years when it was known for its BlackBerry smartphones. Since its acquisition of QNX Software Systems in 2010, the company has become the leading provider of real-time operating systems, middleware, development tools, and services for embedded systems, including automotive infotainment systems, industrial automation, medical devices, and more. While QNX itself does not manufacture semiconductors, its software solutions are often integrated into systems that use semiconductor components. And what’s more, BlackBerry stock is finally seeing some positive growth again. Shares jumped on strong earnings that far outpaced estimates for the first quarter of 2024. As shares continue to climb on strong semiconductor demand, BlackBerry stock could climb once more to heights not seen since 2021."},

In the last 25 years, ENB stock has returned 526% to shareholders, much higher than the TSX index gains of 225%. However, after accounting for dividend reinvestments, Enbridge stock has returned an emphatic 1,720% to shareholders. As past returns don’t matter much to current or future investors, let’s see if Enbridge can continue to deliver outsized gains to shareholders. In this article, I’ll explore if it makes sense to invest in Enbridge stock at the current valuation. An overview of Enbridge Enbridge is a diversified energy infrastructure company valued at $110 billion by  market cap . It operates the largest liquids pipeline system in North America, transporting 30% of the crude oil produced on the continent and 20% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S.  Last year, Enbridge disclosed plans to acquire three natural gas utilities from  Dominion Energy  for $19 billion. Once the acquisition will be completed, Enbridge will be North America’s largest natural gas utility.  In recent years, Enbridge has been investing heavily in clean energy with a growing offshore wind portfolio. Its renewable energy capacity stands at 5.3 gigawatts, which is enough to power almost four million homes. Is Enbridge stock a good buy right now? Despite a challenging macro environment, Enbridge increased its EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) by 11%, while distributable cash flow (DCF) rose by 4% year over year, primarily due to strong asset performance across business verticals. Enbridge emphasized its business risk supports a leverage target of between 4.5 times and five times. The company is hedged against interest rate volatility, with less than 5% of its debt portfolio exposed to floating rates. Moreover, the energy heavyweight is virtually immune to commodity price exposure as more than 98% of its earnings are generated from cost of service or take-or-pay contracted assets. Further, around 80% of its EBITDA is derived from assets that are protected against inflation. Enbridge expects the artificial intelligence megatrend to be a tailwind for energy companies. According to Enbridge, the explosion of generative artificial intelligence models globally has led to the growing demand for natural gas.  As the sector evolves, Enbridge is poised to serve the increased demand through its asset footprint, which connects key supply basins. In fact, Enbridge’s asset base can offer customers access to power by fueling natural gas generation and renewable power, unlocking another revenue stream for the energy behemoth. A growing dividend yield Enbridge has raised its dividends for 29 consecutive years, a remarkable feat for a cyclical company. In this period, Enbridge’s dividend payout has risen by 10% annually. Enbridge ended the first quarter with a distributable cash flow per share of $1.70, up 8% year over year. Comparatively, it pays shareholders a quarterly dividend of $0.92 per share, translating to a sustainable payout ratio of 54%.  Enbridge currently offers a tasty dividend yield of 7.3% making it very attractive to income-seeking shareholders. Priced at 17.4 times  forward earnings , Enbridge stock trades at a reasonable valuation and is priced at a discount of 7% to consensus price target estimates. After adjusting for dividends, ENB stock might return close to 15% in the next 12 months."},

The former is the 50% owner of OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, while the latter owns a number of AI-powered products including Google Search, Google Suite, and Gemini, which is its take on the language models most of the public think of when they hear the word “AI.”  Microsoft and Alphabet both have their strengths. Microsoft has the second most popular cloud computing service after  Amazon’s  AWS, while Alphabet has seven products with over a billion users each. Together, they account for over half the time people spend interacting with  generative AI  worldwide. In this article, I will explore Microsoft and Google side by side so you can decide which is the better AI stock for you. The case for Microsoft The main thing Microsoft has going for it in AI is a first mover’s advantage. After ChatGPT launched in November of 2022, MSFT quickly saw the value in the product and bought 50% of OpenAI, its developer. Almost as swiftly, it built GPT into its Bing Search Engine, which augmented ChatGPT’s pre-trained database with the ability to search the web. With Bing search, you can easily get AI-written responses to questions about the day’s news. That was something not even ChatGPT was capable of! Eventually, some issues with Bing’s “web search approach” became apparent. For example, it was more prone to producing incorrect answers than ChatGPT was. However, it was impressive, and Microsoft leveraged its functionality to justify raising the price of Office 365 enterprise by $30 per month. So, Microsoft made some money off of AI very early on. Few other  big tech companies  can claim to have been that quick to the punch. The case for Alphabet The main case for Alphabet over Microsoft is the fact that its product strategy is more coherent. It has not directly monetized its Chatbot like Microsoft has, but it has a well-known consumer-facing suite of products, all of which integrate with each other. For example, Youtube shows you ads based on your Google search history, and Android has all the Google apps built in. AI has long been part of Google’s Youtube, being used to recommend videos and moderate comments, among other things. The company also broke new ground in developing the AI technologies that were later used in ChatGPT, such as transformers. Finally, its stock is much cheaper than Microsoft’s, trading at 26 times earnings to MSFT’s 35. On the whole, I prefer Google stock to MSFT, mainly because it’s easier to analyze and cheaper while having comparable growth and margins. A Canadian big tech giant If you’re looking for a Canadian big tech stock to rival Microsoft and Alphabet, you could consider  Shopify Inc  ( TSX:SHOP ). Shopify is a Canadian e-commerce company that develops a platform for hosting online stores. Unlike Amazon’s vendors, Shopify vendors own their websites; they just rely on Shopify for some of the functionality. Shopify uses generative AI to create product descriptions and automate customer service. It recently became profitable after years of losing money and is growing its  revenue  at 23% year over year."},

Focusing on  Canadian growth stocks  with high potential could be one of the best strategies to achieve that goal. By investing your hard-earned savings in Canadian companies that have proven track records of innovation and expansion, you could earn some eye-popping returns on your investments in the long run. In this article, I’ll highlight two top Canadian high-growth stocks you can consider buying right now and holding for the next 10 years. BlackBerry stock While many Canadian growth companies might offer exponential growth potential, they also come with some risks and volatility. That’s why it might be a good idea to balance your portfolio with some established names that have proven their resilience and innovation over the years. One such stock is  BlackBerry  ( TSX:BB ), the former smartphone maker that has reinvented itself as a leader in cybersecurity and software solutions today. This Waterloo-artered enterprise software company currently has a  market cap  of $2.8 billion as its stock trades at $4.73 per share after rallying by 25% in the last three months. In its fiscal year 2024 (ended in February), BlackBerry’s total revenue  jumped  30% YoY (year over year) to US$853 million as it benefited from the recent sale of the legacy beaten portfolio. The company surprised analysts and investors by reporting an adjusted annual net profit of US$31 million against a loss of US$103 million in the previous fiscal year, also beating Street analysts’ expectations of a US$1.5 million loss. More importantly, BlackBerry’s IoT (Internet of Things) emerged as a standout performer in the quarter ended in February, hitting a new quarterly record of $66 million, up 25% YoY. Its IoT performance benefited greatly from the QNX software, which saw its royalty backlog soaring to an impressive US$815 million due mainly to significant design wins. This clearly highlights the rising adoption of BlackBerry’s technology in the automotive sector and other IoT applications. With strong growth in the IoT segment, along with the strengthening demand for its artificial intelligence-powered cybersecurity solutions, BlackBerry’s financial growth trends could significantly improve in the next decade, which should help its share prices rally. goeasy stock Another Canadian growth stock with remarkable resilience and growth prospects is  goeasy  ( TSX:GSY ). This Mississauga-headquartered financial services company provides leasing and lending services to subprime borrowers who might face challenges in accessing credit from traditional sources. It currently has a market cap of $2.9 billion as its stock trades at $ 175.94 per share after rallying by around 44% in the last six months. Even as macroeconomic worries and high interest rates have affected most large financial services institutions in the last two years, goeasy continues to post solid growth. In the 12 months ended in March, the company’s total revenue and adjusted earnings jumped by 24.3% and 25.1% YoY, respectively. While goeasy has been beating analysts’ earnings expectations for eight consecutive quarters, its revenue also has exceeded Street’s estimates for five quarters in a row. Interestingly, GSY stock has yielded outstanding 824% positive returns over the last 10 years. And the ongoing strength in its financial growth trends and surging demand for its services suggest that it could continue to impress investors in the coming years. Besides that, this Canadian growth stock also offers a decent 2.7% annualized dividend yield, which could act as a source of stable passive income for you."},

And when that investment also allows me to enjoy a Coke, it explains why  The Coca-Cola Company  ( NYSE:KO ) is one of the few individual stocks I hold.  Coca-Cola isn’t just any company; it’s a dividend powerhouse. Having increased its payouts for 62 consecutive years, it now offers a robust yield of 3.10%. Here, I’ll share my predictions for where Coca-Cola’s dividend might be in a year, alongside some historical data to show how its investors have fared over time.  Coca-Cola dividend history Now, if you’re thinking of buying Coca-Cola today for the next dividend, you’ll have to wait a bit. Why? It recently went ex-dividend in mid-March.  When a stock goes “ex-dividend,” it means that anyone who buys the stock from that day onwards will not be eligible for the next dividend payment.  For example, Coca-Cola most recently went ex-dividend on March 14, 2024, with a dividend of $0.485 USD per share, which was payable on April 1, 2024. This dividend payment of $0.485 is what you receive quarterly, and it’s expected that the next three payments for 2024 will be at the same rate.  Looking back at Coca-Cola’s dividend history, the company paid $0.46 per share quarterly in 2023, $0.44 in 2022, and $0.42 in 2021. Typically, Coca-Cola has increased its dividend by about $0.02 per share each year. Given this pattern, it seems reasonable to predict that next year’s dividend could be around $0.50 per share, assuming the company continues its trend of annual increases and everything goes as planned. A historical investment in Coca-Cola Imagine you travelled back to 1986 and invested $10,000 in Coca-Cola. Over the years, thanks to the company’s strong performance and regular  stock splits , this initial investment would have grown significantly.  Specifically, the value of your shares would have  compounded  at an annualized rate of 9.73%, turning your $10,000 into $350,883 based purely on price returns. But let’s consider a scenario wherein you didn’t just sit on the dividends received; instead, you reinvested them back into buying more Coca-Cola shares whenever they were distributed.  With this strategy, your investment would have benefited not only from the increase in stock price but also from the power of compounding dividends.  As a result, your $10,000 would have snowballed into an impressive $871,063, achieving an even higher annualized return of 12.4%. This illustrates the significant impact that reinvesting dividends can have on the overall growth of an investment, especially with a blue-chip stock like Coca-Cola that has a long history of dividend growth. But, as solid as it is, Coca-Cola is still a single stock. If you’re a long-term investor, consider diversifying with some other picks (and the Fool has some great suggestions down below!)."},

One glaring difference is healthcare. In the  US S&P 500 Index , it is the third-largest sector (12.6%) after information technology (28.9%) and financials (13%). In the  S&P/TSX Composite Index , healthcare (0.3%) is the smallest among the 11 primary sectors, while financials (31.3%) and energy (17.1%) are the  heavyweights . The healthcare sector seldom outperforms, although, in 2024, individual components beat the broader market. This May, best in the lot are  Vitalhub  ( TSX:VHI ) and  Medical Facilities Corp.  ( TSX:DR ). If you’re after monthly passive income and don’t expect much on price appreciation, high-yield  NorthWest Healthcare Properties  ( TSX:NWH.UN ) is the logical choice. Digital transformation                  Vitalhub is obscure, but the healthcare stock is flying high. At $6.63 per share, current investors enjoy a 62.5% year-to-date gain. The trailing one-year price return is 142.9%. Had you invested $6,500 a year ago, your money would be worth $15,785.71 today. The $336 million company provides software dedicated to health and human services providers. Its primary purpose is to improve care delivery by developing an ecosystem of harmonious solutions for these sectors. Given the Q1 2024 financial results, its CEO, Dan Matlow, said VitalHub is well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, revenue and annual recurring revenue (ARR) increased 21% to $15.3 million and $47.8 million, respectively. Notably, EBITDA rose 56% to $3.1 million, while net income soared  713%  year over year to $1.3 million.    “Our strong financial position supports our ambitious growth plans and our commitment to leading the digital transformation in healthcare,” added Matlow. Unique business model Prospective investors can earn two ways from Medical Facilities: capital gains and dividends. At $11.80 per share, the healthcare stock is up 32.4% year to date and pays a decent 2.83% dividend. This $288.8 million market cap company owns or has controlling interests in specialty surgical hospitals in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and South Dakota, as well as an ambulatory surgery centre in California. The business model is unique in that physicians have direct involvement in operations through established partnerships. Medical Facilities’ competitive advantages are their high-quality surgical facilities, the ever-increasing demand for health care, and the growing but fragmented outpatient services market. In Q1 2024, facility service revenue and income from operations rose 4.5% and 29.6% year over year respectively to $108.3 million and $17.5 million. Because of the strong cash flows, the company reduced debt by $5 million, and the Board approved an 11.8% dividend hike. Only REIT in the cure sector NorthWest Healthcare trades at $5.33 per share (+6% year-to-date) and pays a hefty 7.05% dividend. A $7,000 investment today would transform into a recurring monthly passive income of $41.12. The investment pitch for this healthcare-related  real estate  stock is simple. This $1.3 billion real estate investment trust (REIT) is the only REIT in the cure sector. NorthWest Healthcare owns and operates healthcare real estate infrastructure. The medical office buildings, hospitals, and clinics are in North America, Brazil, Europe, and Australasia. Besides stable occupancies, the leases are long-term. Strong fundamentals   Vitalhub, Medical Facilities, and NorthWest Healthcare Properties boast strong fundamentals.

A handful of Canada’s top dividend stocks with a long history of paying and increasing their dividends have raised their regular payouts in May 2024. A few more could follow as the current earnings season draws out. Of particular interest are dividend raises at  CT Real Estate Investment Trust  ( TSX:CRT.UN ) or CT REIT, the  TMX Group  ( TSX:X ), and an expected payout increase from  Canadian Western Bank  ( TSX:CWB ) stock later this month. The  Dividend Aristocrats  stand out for their commitment to growing dividends and boosting total shareholder returns. Let’s explore how much they raised payouts in May and why you may wish to buy them to make passive income. CT REIT raises monthly distributions in May CT REIT is a $1.5 billion Canadian real estate investment trust (REIT) with an ever-growing portfolio of 370 commercial properties across Canada. Its properties remain fully occupied in 2024, earnings surged by 43% during the first quarter, and its rental cash flow-generating portfolio remains robust — giving management and trustees confidence to continue raising dividends. The REIT raised its monthly distributions by 3% on May 6, 2024, to $0.0771 per unit. The higher payout, effective with the July payout, should yield a juicier 6.7% annually. CT REIT is a Canadian Dividend Aristocrat to buy for  monthly passive income , especially following 10 consecutive years of distribution increases. Most noteworthy, CT REIT is one of Canada’s top dividend stocks paying one of the safest distributions in its asset class. It paid out 73.1% of its adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) during the first quarter of this year — an improvement from the 73.8% AFFO payout rate seen during the same period last year. Its debt level remains low and manageable, and the REIT keeps getting profitable orders for new retail space as its tenant, a financially strong  Canadian Tire , expands its retail footprint. TMX Group increases dividends by 6% The TMX Group owns and operates key financial markets infrastructure for investment and trading, including the Toronto Stock Exchange. The stock exchange operator enticed its investors with a 6% dividend raise on May 6, 2024. The latest dividend raise marks the ninth consecutive year of dividend growth for TMX Group stock investors, and it was the fourth increase within the last two years. The TMX Group stock can afford dividend raises following a decade of strong revenue, earnings, and free cash flow growth. The top Canadian dividend stock’s free cash flow has grown by nearly 75% during the past 10 years, following an 88% increase in revenue. X Revenue (TTM)  data by  YCharts A strong 208% gain in the TMX Group stock during the past decade makes the dividend yield low at 2% annually, but the dividend raised the total return for the period to almost 300%. The payout is well-covered, given a 49% historical earnings payout rate. Management has room to keep raising dividends for many more years, keeping the stock’s Dividend Aristocrat status intact. Canadian Western Bank stock to raise dividend Beaten-down regional bank Canadian Western Bank is  evolving  into a national financier as it widens its portfolios to Eastern provinces and diversifies its business away from Western Canada’s commodity-driven economics to stabilize its earnings. A wider customer base gives added stability to Canadian Western Bank stock’s quarterly dividend, which the bank customarily increases by $0.01 every two quarters. The bank may announce its next dividend raise on May 31, 2024, alongside its second-quarter earnings results. However, there hasn’t been an official statement to this fact yet. The bank stock has raised dividends for 32 years, earning its place among  Canada’s top dividend payers . It has been raising payouts after every two quarters by $0.01 since 2011. Since the pandemic, Canadian Western Bank stock’s dividend raises have been declared in May and December. Shares trade 34% lower than their previous highs seen in 2021. Income-oriented investors will love CWB stock’s 5% dividend yield. The payout looks safe given a historical earnings payout rate of 40%. Management expects to deliver a low to mid-single-digit earnings growth for 2024, which may set the bank stock on a path to recovery, rewarding investors with capital gains."},

Power of compounding One popular investing strategy for building long-term retirement wealth involves buying quality dividend stocks and using the distributions to acquire new shares. The reinvestment of the dividend in new shares increases the size of the next dividend to buy even more shares. The snowball effect is small at the beginning of the process, but the impact can be substantial over the course of two or three decades, especially when dividend payouts increase at a steady pace and the share price drifts higher. Many companies offer discounts of up to 5% on shares purchased through the dividend-reinvestment plan (DRIP). This helps boost the return on the reinvested funds. In addition, during times of market pullbacks, dividends can buy a larger number of shares, which can make it easier for investors to ride out a downturn.  The strategy requires patience, but it can pay off in a big way over the long haul. Fortis Fortis  ( TSX:FTS ) trades near $55.75 per share at the time of writing. That’s up from the 12-month low of around $50, but still down from the $64 the stock fetched about two years ago. Fortis is a utility company with about $65 billion in assets spread out across Canada, the United States, and the Caribbean. The businesses are primarily rate-regulated operations that include power generation facilities, electric transmission networks, and natural gas distribution utilities. Revenue and cash flow tends to be reliable and predictable. This enables management to plan out capital investments over several years to drive growth. Fortis is currently working on a $25 billion capital program that will boost the rate base from $37 billion in 2023 to $49.4 billion in 2028. The resulting increase in cash flow should support the planned annual dividend hikes of 4-6% over that timeframe. Fortis raised the payout in each of the past 50 years and offers a 2% DRIP discount. The stock currently provides a 4.25% dividend yield. Long-term shareholders have done well with Fortis stock. A $10,000 investment in Fortis 25 years ago would be worth about $160,000 today with the dividends reinvested. Enbridge Enbridge  ( TSX:ENB ) is a giant in the North American energy infrastructure industry with a current market capitalization near $107 billion. The company’s oil pipelines move 30% of the oil produced in Canada and the United States. The natural gas transmission network transports about a fifth of the natural gas used by American homes and businesses.  Enbridge’s growth initiatives in the past few years have focused on exports, renewable energy, and natural gas utilities. The company owns an oil export terminal and is a partner in the Woodfibre liquified natural gas (LNG) export facility being built in British Columbia. In addition, Enbridge is in the process of finalizing its US$14 billion acquisition of three natural gas utilities in the United States. Demand for North American oil and natural gas is expected to grow in the coming years as countries around the globe seek out reliable supplies. In the domestic markets, a wave of data centre construction is projected to boost demand for electricity. Analysts expect gas-fired power generation to deliver a good chunk of the required power supply. Enbridge trades near $50 per share at the time of writing compared to $59 at the peak in 2022. Investors can get a 7.3% yield on the stock right now. The board raised the payout by 3.1% for 2024 and Enbridge investors have received a dividend increase in each of the past 29 years. A $10,000 investment in ENB stock 25 years ago would be worth about $175,000 today with the dividends reinvested. The bottom line on top TSX stocks for TFSA total returns There is no guarantee that these companies will deliver the same returns over the next quarter century, but the strategy of buying top TSX dividend-growth stocks and using the distributions to buy new shares is a proven one for building retirement portfolios over the long term. Several top Canadian dividend stocks now trade at discounted prices."},

It’s crucial to identify a portfolio of  undervalued stocks  that you can buy at a cheap price and benefit from market-beating returns when sentiment improves. Here are three such Canadian value stocks to buy right now. High Tide stock Valued at a  market cap  of $240 million,  High Tide  ( TSXV:HITI ) is a retail-focused cannabis company with brick-and-mortar as well as global e-commerce assets. Its growing network of stores across Canada is complemented by a strong position in North America. Moreover, High Tide sells accessories and premium hemp-derived CBD products via its e-commerce platform. High Tide’s subsidiary, Canna Cabana, is the largest non-franchised cannabis retail chain in Canada and operates 165 retail cannabis stores in the country. Despite an uncertain macro environment, High Tide increased sales by 9% year over year in fiscal Q1 of 2024 (ended in January). High Tide attributed top-line growth to a shift in retail pricing strategy, the launch of the discount club model, store openings, and organic growth. It ended Q1 with 161 stores, up from 147 stores in the year-ago period. High Tide’s strong performance can be tied to its innovative discount club model. This includes the paid subscription to its ELITE membership program and the Cabana Club. Its Cabana Club’s membership surpassed 1.3 million, which should result in strong recurring revenue. Unlike most other  cannabis stocks , High Tide is on the cusp of reporting consistent profits. Analysts tracking the stock expect it to report adjusted earnings of $0.17 per share in fiscal 2025, compared to a loss of $0.03 per share in 2023. So, priced at 18 times  forward earnings , High Tide stock is quite cheap right now. Spartan Delta stock Valued at $720 million by market cap,  Spartan Delta  ( TSX:SDE ) has a portfolio of production and development opportunities in the Deep Basin and Duvernay. It aims to focus on organic drilling opportunities in the Deep Basin and target acquisitions, which should drive future cash flows higher. In Q1 2024, Spartan Delta reported oil and gas sales of $84.1 million and adjusted funds flow of $45.7 million, or $0.26 per share. It executed a $45 million capital program in Q1 as it continued to develop liquids-rich targets in the Deep Basin. Priced at just 1.4 times forward earnings, Spartan Delta is among the cheapest Canadian stocks you can buy in May 2024. Secure Energy Services stock The final undervalued stock on the list is  Secure Energy Services  ( TSX:SES ). Valued at $3 billion by market cap, Secure Energy is a water management and energy infrastructure company. It expects to end 2024 with an adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) of between $450 million and $465 million, indicating the stock trades at an Enterprise Value/ EBITDA multiple of less than seven times, which is very cheap. Additionally, Secure Energy pays shareholders a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share, translating to a forward yield of 3.5%. In Q1, Secure Energy reported free cash flow of $93 million, or $0.33 per share, indicating a payout ratio of less than 40%."},

Supported by its solid quarterly performances and healthy growth prospects, the company is trading 14.9% higher this year, outperforming the broader equity markets. Let’s assess whether Waste Connections would be a buy at these levels by looking at its performance in the recently reported first quarter, growth prospects, and valuation.  Waste Connections’s first-quarter earnings Waste Connections reported solid first-quarter earnings, with its  top line  growing by 9.1% to US$2.07 billion. Contributions from acquisitions over the last 12 months and higher recovered commodity values drove its top line. Meanwhile, its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) grew 14.8% to US$650.7 million. It was US$10 million higher than the management’s guidance. Also, its adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 160 basis points from the previous year and 20 basis points from the prior quarter to 31.4%. Supported by its top-line growth and expansion of its operating margin, Waste Connections’s net income grew by 16.3% while its adjusted EPS (earnings per share) grew by 16.9%. The company generated an adjusted free cash flow of $324.8 million, representing an 18.5% increase from the previous year’s quarter. Its free cash flows were 15.7% of its total revenue, an improvement from 14.4% in the previous year’s quarter. During the quarter, the company raised US$750 million through senior notes, with the proceeds directed towards reducing its debt levels. Now, let’s look at its growth prospects. Waste Connections’s outlook Given its solid financial position and healthy free cash flows, Waste Connections is well-equipped to continue its acquisitions, with the company naming 2024 one of its busiest years ever. As of April 24, the company has made several acquisitions this year that could contribute US$375 million of annualized revenue. In February, it acquired 30 energy waste treatment and disposal facilities, which could contribute around $300 million to its total revenue. Further, Waste Connections also focuses on organic growth and is developing several renewable gas or RNG (renewable natural gas) facilities, three of which will be operational this year. Also, despite the industry-wide equipment and utility installation delays, the company’s management is optimistic that its developmental projects could deliver an incremental $200 million annual EBITDA beginning in 2026. Meanwhile, the company has planned to invest around $150 million in these projects this year. Amid these growth prospects, Waste Connections’s management has provided impressive 2024 guidance, with its topline projected to grow by 9.1% to $8.75 billion. Its adjusted EBITDA could increase by 13.4% while expanding its adjusted EBITDA margin by 120 basis points to 32.7%. So, its growth prospects look healthy. Investors’ takeaway Amid the recent increase in its stock price, Waste Connections’s valuation has increased, with its next 12-month  price-to-earnings  multiple at 34.1. Although its valuation looks expensive, I believe it is justified, given its solid underlying businesses, improving profitability, and healthy growth prospects. It has also raised its  dividends  at an annualized rate of 14.3% since 2010, which is encouraging. The broader equity markets have turned volatile amid concerns over high inflation, geopolitical tension, and the impact of high interest rates on global growth. So, in this uncertain outlook, Waste Connections, which has been delivering consistent performances over the years, would be an ideal buy."},

Some are simply missed because they happen in stocks that tend to fly under the radar. Others might be recognized too late by the investors. And while  Cronos Group  ( TSX:CRON ) may seem like such a missed opportunity to some investors, it’s not for several reasons. The company Cronos Group is currently one of the largest  cannabis stocks  trading on the TSX right now, boasting a market capitalization of $1.45 billion. It’s an international Cannabis company with a presence in three markets — Canada, Israel, and the U.S., though the latter is through a strategic partnership. It has three brands under its banner, including both recreational and medical. In Canada, Cronos Group claims to be the second most famous and top edible and flower brand. It’s growing its presence in Israel and the U.S. and is positioned to operate in at least eight states. Why it’s not too late to buy Cronos Like many other cannabis stocks in Canada, Cronos experienced a modest bullish surge. It has risen over 45% since the beginning of March, and while it’s not consistent, the stock is still moving upwards. That’s one of the reasons it’s still possible to buy Cronos — i.e., it’s still going up.  We don’t know how long it may continue. The company recently published its results, and they are optimistic enough to inspire confidence in the investors.   The company has increased its revenue and lowered its losses by quite a significant margin. The positive earnings may allow the stock to keep riding the momentum initially triggered by optimism around U.S. marijuana legalization. This is the second reason buying this stock is not too late. Even if the U.S. government doesn’t legalize marijuana on a federal level, the optimism around it and the anticipation may prolong the  bull market  phase of many Canadian marijuana stocks, including Cronos. Several states have legalized cannabis for both medical and recreational use, and new additions to that list can also beef up Cronos stock. Foolish takeaway The legal cannabis market inside Canada is still contending with the black market and struggling with regulatory challenges. While it’s not a promising outlook, it indicates that there is still a lot of room for organic growth for companies like Cronos. However, its full potential will emerge when it capitalizes on the growing U.S. and other international markets to which it may develop access over time."},

One such under-$10  dividend stock  that pays a 6.8% yield is  Decisive Dividend  ( TSXV:DE ). Valued at a  market cap  of $153 million, Decisive Dividend pays shareholders a monthly dividend of $0.045 per share, indicating a yield of almost 6.8%. In the last 10 years, the small-cap stock has risen close to 700%. After adjusting for dividends, cumulative returns are much higher at 1,430%. However, the TSXV dividend stock trades 29% below all-time highs, allowing shareholders to buy the dip. Let’s see if this dividend stock should be a part of your portfolio in 2024. An overview of Decisive Dividend Decisive Dividend is an acquisition-oriented company focused on opportunities in the manufacturing sector. It uses a disciplined acquisition strategy to identify profitable, high-quality manufacturing companies with a sustainable competitive advantage, a focus on non-discretionary products, steady cash flows, and growth potential. Decisive Dividend acquires Techbelt Last month, Decisive Dividend acquired Techbelt, a manufacturer of PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) conveyor belts, PTFE tapes, and related materials used in a wide range of end markets such as food and beverage, packaging, textiles, and fast-moving consumer goods. The acquisition was valued at $6.3 million and self-funded through a drawdown on the company’s syndicated credit facility. The acquisition enhances the scale of Decisive Dividend’s wear-parts product segment while allowing it to expand in the United Kingdom. Moreover Decisive Dividend expects the acquisition to be immediately accretive and increase adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) by 3% year over year. Decisive Dividend stated that Techbelt adds another recurring revenue, high-margin, low-capital intensity business to its portfolio. How did Decisive Dividend perform in Q1 of 2024? Due to a challenging macro environment, Decisive Dividend reported revenue of $29.4 million in the first quarter (Q1) of 2024, down 5% year over year. The decline in the top line was driven by decreases in hearth product sales, where backlogs were lower in Q1 compared to the year-ago period. Its consolidated gross profit rose 1% to $11.2 million, indicating a margin of 38%, up from 36% in the prior-year quarter. One reason for the high gross margins was the contribution from four high-margin businesses acquired in 2023.   However, an elevated cost environment meant adjusted EBITDA fell by 19% to $4 million in the March quarter. Its net income fell to $0.2 million, or $0.01 per share, compared to a net income of $2 million, or $0.13 per share, in the year-ago period. Its consolidated free cash flow also fell 36% to $1.9 million, or $0.10 per share. Decisive Dividend explained that an erosion in profit margins has meant its payout ratio has risen to 66% in the last 12 months, up from 54% in 2023. However, it is still within target levels, providing the company with the flexibility to target accretive acquisitions and grow the payout over time. Priced at 13.8 times  forward earnings , the dividend stock is quite cheap, given that analysts expect adjusted earnings to expand from $0.45 per share in 2023 to $0.58 per share in 2024 and $0.75 per share in 2025. Analysts remain bullish and expect the stock to surge over 40% in the next 12 months."},

TSLA stock went public in July 2010 and has since returned an emphatic 13,000% to shareholders, easily crushing broader market returns.  Despite these market-thumping gains, Tesla is often among the most “shorted” stocks in the United States. Basically, short-selling is a trading strategy where you borrow a security and sell it on the exchange while planning to buy back the stock at a lower price. It means that short-sellers expect the share price to fall in the near term. Tesla is among the most shorted stocks in the S&P 500 index. In April, more than 107 million Tesla shares were shorted, which is around 3.4% of its total outstanding shares. However, Tesla’s stock surged over almost 40% soon after its first-quarter (Q1) results, which led to US$5.5 billion in losses across four trading sessions for short-sellers, according to data from S3 Partners. In fact, since Tesla has been listed on the stock market, short-sellers have lost over US$65 billion to date. Alternatively, as Tesla stock is down 32% in 2023, profits booked by short-sellers totalled US$4.1 billion in the first four months of 2024. Despite its outsized gains, Tesla shares are down almost 60% from all-time highs. But it makes little sense to bet against the world’s largest electric vehicle (EV) maker, given its first-mover advantage, expanding addressable market, and strong brand presence. Tesla’s growth story is far from over In the last 18 months, Tesla has been struggling with slowing vehicle sales and narrowing gross margins. Due to inflation and rising interest rates, the demand for EVs has fallen off a cliff, forcing legacy automobile manufacturers such as  Ford  and  General Motors  to delay their EV expansion plans. To boost demand, Tesla cut vehicle prices multiple times in recent months, which caused its sales to be down 9% year over year while gross margins narrowed by 200 basis points to 17.4% in Q1 of 2024. The decline in sales and narrowing margins meant Tesla’s earnings fell by 53% to US$0.34 per share in the March quarter. Moreover, Tesla reported a negative free cash flow in Q1, which means it is burning cash to run its operations. Alternatively, Tesla is an EV giant that sold 1.8 million vehicles and generated US$97 billion in sales in 2023. In addition to manufacturing battery-powered vehicles, Tesla is focused on widening its artificial intelligence capabilities by introducing FSD (full self-driving vehicles). Here, Tesla aims to eventually roll out a robotaxi that can function without a driver. This ride-hailing service will be in direct competition with incumbents such as  Uber . But as the cars will be driverless, Tesla’s profit margins should be much higher, unlocking another multi-billion revenue stream for the company. Wall Street will closely follow Tesla’s upcoming event in August, as it will provide further insights into its FSD capabilities. The takeaway Tesla stock might remain vulnerable in the near term, making it attractive to short-sellers. However, short-selling is a high-risk strategy with the potential for unlimited losses. Instead, Tesla stock has a good chance of rebounding and delivering stellar returns due to its diversifying revenue base and wider portfolio of cars across price points."},

Lightspeed Commerce  ( TSX:LSPD ) is one  tech stock  many investors will have their eyes on. May 16 will see Lightspeed Commerce release its annual earnings report, and there will be much to look at for investors interested in the stock. As of this writing, Lightspeed stock trades for $18.68 per share. This is surprising stability in its share prices, considering the drastic changes happening at the company. From its founder returning to his role in the company as the chief executive officer (CEO) to a lot of layoffs in the company to cut costs, investors are wondering what to expect. What has happened to Lightspeed? As of this writing, Lightspeed trades at a massive 34.98% discount from its 52-week high. It has remained down for a long while. The $2.88 billion market capitalization tech firm offers cloud-based commerce platforms for large and enterprise-level businesses.  Lightspeed primarily focuses on businesses in the retail and restaurant segments. Starting as a company offering point-of-sales solutions, Lightspeed has transformed into a firm that helps its clients compete more effectively. Despite boasting a lot of promise, Lightspeed stock fell from grace in 2022, right before the broader tech sector meltdown. A short-seller report said that the company’s gross merchandise volume (GMV) was dubious, and it was not doing as well as it represented. The report resulted in a drastic drop in share prices. Coupled with the industry-wide selloff, Lightspeed stock still has not recovered. How is the company doing? The company’s former CEO, Jean-Paul Chauvet, initiated a substantial turnaround for the company in his tenure. He unified the company’s previous acquisitions into excellent product offerings.  Under his guidance, the company began focusing on larger and better-established merchants, improving revenue quality. The moves also promoted cross-selling for different Lightspeed products, particularly payment solutions. Lightspeed appears to be doing much better now. The company’s revenues are rising, and it is reducing its operating losses. While it will still take time for it to achieve the break-even point for its operations, Lightspeed has the momentum to get there now. The company’s restructuring exercises in April 2024 reinforced this belief. Lightspeed plans to further reduce its operating losses by letting go of 10% of its employed. Restructuring will allow the company to have more resources available for investments in other areas. Share-buyback plans Lightspeed also plans to repurchase 10% of its common stock on the open market. This will amount to around $192 million worth of shares.  This is the maximum number of shares it can buy back in a year. It means the company would likely want to repurchase more shares if possible. It also shows that management believes the company is undervalued at current levels. Foolish takeaway Lightspeed has a balance sheet full of cash. Cash comprises almost 60% of the company’s identifiable assets. The company’s decision to repurchase the maximum number of shares that regulations allow means management is hopeful about a turnaround. While we await the full picture in its upcoming earnings report, there might be reason enough to believe that Lightspeed stock is a good buy at around $18 per share. If you are looking for  growth stocks  to add to your self-directed portfolio, Lightspeed stock might warrant a place in your holdings."},

With this backdrop, let’s look at two  TSX stocks  that could help set you up for life.  But before discussing stocks, it’s important to highlight that investors should focus on diversifying their portfolio to reduce risk and must not invest all of their savings in one or two stocks. Let’s delve into the stocks.  Shopify  Investing in stocks with  solid fundamentals  and exposure to sectors with secular tailwinds can help investors leverage the power of compounding and build considerable wealth over time.  Shopify  ( TSX:SHOP ) is one such stock that has the potential to set you up for life.  Shares of this  Canadian tech company  have lost substantial value from the pandemic-led highs. Moreover, SHOP stock fell nearly 24% since it released its first-quarter financial results on May 8, due to the near-term growth concerns.  The correction in its price provides an excellent opportunity to buy SHOP stock at a discounted valuation and gain exposure to secular trends like digitization. While short-term growth concerns could keep Shopify volatile, its dominant positioning in the e-commerce space, diverse offerings such as payment processing, marketing tools, shipping solutions, and geographic expansion position it well to capitalize on the structural shift in selling models toward omnichannel platforms.  The increased adoption of its products, higher penetration of Shopify Payments (which will provide cross-selling opportunities), and integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in its offerings position it well to generate solid growth. In addition, the company’s focus on cost-reduction measures and ongoing transition towards an asset-light business model set the base for profitable growth in the future.  Given the recent correction, Shopify stock is trading at the next 12-month enterprise value-to-sales multiple of 8.1, which is much below its historical average. This implies that Shopify stock offers solid growth prospects and is undervalued near the current levels. goeasy goeasy  ( TSX:GSY ) is a must-have stock for investors seeking above-average returns and solid dividend income. This financial services company provides loans and leasing services to subprime borrowers. What stands out is that goeasy’s revenue and EPS sport a compound annual growth rate of 20% and 32%, respectively, in the past five years.  Thanks to its robust financial performance, goeasy stock has gained around 296% in the past five years, significantly beating the broader market averages. Moreover, it has delivered a more than 1,100% return in the past decade. Besides capital gains, goeasy’s  dividends sport very high growth , indicating the company’s commitment to return higher cash to its shareholders.  A large subprime lending market, goeasy’s strong competitive positioning, omnichannel offerings, and diversified funding sources will drive its loan portfolio and overall revenue. As the momentum in goeasy’s top line will likely be sustained, the company’s bottom line could benefit from operating leverage and prudent risk-management practices, resulting in steady credit and payment performance.  While goeasy is poised to deliver solid financials, its share price looks compelling near the current price levels. It is trading at the next 12-month  price-to-earnings  multiple of 10, which appears undervalued considering its EPS CAGR of over 30% and a dividend yield of more than 2.6%."},

Undoubtedly, the TSX has been weighed down for a while, and though only time will tell what we’ll have for summer, I think investors selling their stocks shouldn’t be too surprised if markets stay getting hot for summer. Though lightening up could make sense if you’re a bit short on dry powder, I wouldn’t blindly subscribe to the “sell-in-May-and-go-away” phrase, especially this year. As the much-awaited breakout for the Canadian stock market takes hold, investors should stash the  modestly priced  growth plays on their radar. In this piece, we’ll quickly check in with two that seem like they could continue strong into year’s end. Without further ado, consider the following stocks. Thomson Reuters Thomson Reuters  ( TSX:TRI ) stock has quietly outperformed the TSX Index over the past two, five, and 10 years. Over the past two years, the media and information firm has surged over 88%. Those impressive gains are supported by stellar quarterly results. Just one month ago, Thomson Reuters beat its first-quarter (Q1) revenue expectations while also hiking the annual dividend by 10%. Moving ahead, I’d look for the firm to set its laser focus on artificial intelligece (AI).  Management noted a bit about its “AI product roadmap” and how acquisitions fit into the overall story. Undoubtedly, Thomson Reuters has not only been investing in AI tech, but it’s also on the hunt for some small fish in the AI pond.  Indeed, Thomson Reuters is, in fact, an AI play. At writing, shares go for 32.4 times trailing price to earnings. It’s not cheap, especially after the latest spike. That said, I’d watch the $103.4 billion juggernaut closely for any bumps in the road. Such dips ought to be viewed as potentially favourable entry points. Constellation Software Constellation Software  ( TSX:CSU ) is another wonderful Canadian business that has plenty of room to grow in the coming years. The firm has a magnifying glass on the Canadian software scene, hungry for promising, potentially overlooked firms that could grow to become something special. Shares of CSU have also handsomely outpaced the TSX Index in the past two years, rising around 98%. Undoubtedly, that’s an impressive gain that should have the full attention of Canadian  investors  seeking domestic ways to beat the TSX Index consistently over the long haul. On Friday, Constellation Software stock sunk more than 2%. Though not much of a dip, I would keep CSU stock atop my radar in case a correction takes hold. Undoubtedly, any past corrections have proven to be great times to load up.  At around 34 times forward price to earnings, shares are slightly on the expensive side. But I’d argue they deserve to sport a hefty premium. Perhaps nibbling into a starter position makes sense here as the stock retreats below the $3,850 level of resistance en route to potentially lower levels."},

The table below shows how your $20,000 will compound over 15 years and generate $3,346 in annual passive income.  Year 7% Dividend Yield Total Amount 2024   $20,000.0 2025 $1,400.0 $21,400.0 2026 $1,498.0 $22,898.0 2027 $1,602.9 $24,500.9 2028 $1,715.1 $26,215.9 2029 $1,835.1 $28,051.0 2030 $1,963.6 $30,014.6 2031 $2,101.0 $32,115.6 2032 $2,248.1 $34,363.7 2033 $2,405.5 $36,769.2 2034 $2,573.8 $39,343.0 2035 $2,754.0 $42,097.0 2036 $2,946.8 $44,851.1 2037 $3,139.6 $47,797.8 2038 $3,345.8 $50,937.4 How to convert $20,000 into $3,346 annual passive income.  Assuming your $20,000 investment earns a 7% annual yield of $1,400, you can  compound this  return by reinvesting the payout in another 7% yield stock. The objective is to look for a safe 7% yield.  The risk is that you may lock in a lower yield in some years when the market is at its peak. However, this risk will be offset if you continue investing your dividends even in a downtrend. You could probably lock in an 8-9% yield in the downturn that could offset a 5-6% yield during the upturn.  Invest $20,000 in these three stocks You can lock in greater than 7% yield by investing $20,000 in the below three stocks:    TC Energy  ( TSX:TRP ): 7.28%   Enbridge  ( TSX:ENB ): 7.08%   BCE  ( TSX:BCE ): 8.6%   Pipeline stocks  The first two are pipeline stocks and have a similar industry risk. However, their operations and business risks are different. TC Energy is spinning off its business into liquid and gas pipelines. On one side, it is divesting its non-core assets to reduce its debt to 4.75 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). On the other side, it is building new pipelines and is on  track to  place about $7 billion of assets into service in 2024. The company said that it will continue to grow its dividends by 3-5% after the spinoff. This growth rate is slower than its 20-year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7%, but it will help your passive income grow with inflation.  Enbridge stock has a stable balance sheet and is acquiring a gas utilities business to add to its stable cash flow. Along with the acquisition, Enbridge is also building new pipelines. The addition of new pipelines and an increase in the toll rate helped it grow its dividends steadily for 29 years in a row. The two stocks can help you achieve a relatively stable passive income for retirement.  BCE stock  The telecom stock has slipped 27% in a year and is trading near its 10-year low. The dip is partially because of high interest rates that have made its debt expensive and are eating on its cash flows. BCE paid out 113% of its free cash flow (FCF) in dividends in 2023 and still grew its dividends per share by 3% in 2024 despite expecting a dip in FCF. This has raised concerns about BCE pausing its dividend growth. The interest rate headwind will subside as BCE will use rate cuts to restructure debt. Until then, it has increased its liquidity to thrive. The major concern is a regulatory decision to give smaller competitors access to BCE’s expensive infrastructure at a discounted rate. If this becomes a law, it could force BCE to cut dividends for a few years until it establishes its new revenue sources of digital ads and cloud. There is a risk but also a reward of locking in an 8.6% dividend yield and a 40% capital appreciation in a recovery rally if the regulator reverses its decision."},

However, that dividend stock went on to fall as higher interest rates put pressure on the company. But today, there’s been a rebound — one that has allowed me to reconsider buying up the dividend stock again and again. So, let’s look at why I’m now considering picking up more of  NorthWest Healthcare Properties REIT  ( TSX:NWH.UN ). What happened? Shares of NWH stock flew higher during the pandemic as a push towards  healthcare  support became paramount. The company seized the opportunity as well to take advantage of lower interest rates, acquiring businesses for a steal. The problem was that interest rates and inflation rose. Furthermore, the interest in healthcare stocks came to a halt. Rising interest rates and inflation can negatively impact real estate investment trusts (REITs) like Northwest Healthcare REIT. Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs, making it more expensive for REITs to finance new projects or refinance existing debt. Additionally, inflation can erode the purchasing power of rental income, leading to lower returns for investors.  NWH stock then reported lower-than-expected earnings or revenue growth. This disappointed investors and led to a decline in share price. Factors such as increased operating expenses, reduced occupancy rates, or tenant bankruptcies could all negatively impact the company’s financial performance.  And then, the dreaded addition: a  dividend  cut. A year of saving In the last year, management did the responsible thing. NWH stock went further than a dividend cut, selling non-core assets to strengthen its bottom line. This was also done by refinancing its loans and consolidating debts at lower levels. So, after falling to a 52-week low of $3.89 per share, shares started climbing once more. Shares now trade at about $5.15 at the time of writing. That’s an increase of 32% in a short period of time! What’s more, management believes the worst is over. During the fourth quarter, management stated that 2023 was about strengthening the business and its balance sheet. The healthcare real estate portfolio has performed well and will continue to do so in a sector that remains resilient and “positioned for growth.” So, now, the constraints experienced in the last year that came from balance sheet leverage are over, and the company can now focus on the strength of its strong real estate and business. Getting a deal While numbers are slowly improving, the base is still there. The company holds a 97% occupancy rate and 99% rental collection rate. Its average lease expiry sits at 13.3 years, providing investors with stable cash flow to support the dividend. Meanwhile, that dividend yield sits at 7.02% at the time of writing — all while trading at an incredibly valuable 7.42 times earnings over the last year as well as 0.62 times book value. So, with shares still down 36% in the last year, a super-high dividend, and growth to come, NorthWest stock looks like a dividend stock that’s worth a second look."},

My Top 3 Stocks to Invest in at the Moment", "title_link": "https://www.fool.ca/2024/05/13/have-a-spare-1000-my-top-3-stocks-to-invest-in-at-the-moment/", "published_date": "May 13, 2024", "publisher_name": "Amy Legate-Wolfe", "Description": "If you have $1,000 just sitting around, waiting to be invested. There are certainly some strong stock options to pick up right now. Whether it’s growth,  dividends , or stability, these are the best three to pick up on the TSX today. Kinross Gold You’d have to be under a rock for the last year or so not to know that gold prices have surged. The price of gold tends to rise during economic uncertainty. This creates a hedge against inflation, with tightening central bank policies such as interest rate adjustments creating a better time for gold buyers — and gold miners — hence why  Kinross Gold  ( TSX:K ) has surged in share price. The company has beaten out earnings estimates quarter after quarter. Kinross stock may be Canadian based, but its production operates across North and South America, West Africa, and Russia. The company holds high production levels of gold as well as a significant portfolio of gold reserves and resources. Shares climbed once again this month as the company performed quite well during its first quarter. The company produced 527,399 of gold equivalent ounces, a 13% year-over-year increase. With the price of gold so high, Kinross increased its margins by 20% to US$1,088 per gold ounce. So, as gold prices continue to remain high, Kinross stock will as well. Brookfield Renewable If you’re looking for a solid long-term buy, then I would consider  Brookfield Renewable Partners  ( TSX:BEP.UN ). The company offers another rising share price, with the company seeing a climb of 36% since announcing its first-quarter earnings were coming out. Even though Brookfield Renewable stock reported a net loss, funds from operations climbed to US$296 million, an 8% year-over-year increase. What’s more, it continued to move forward with strong partnerships. This includes a partnership with  Microsoft  ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), with Brookfield Renewable aiming to deliver over 10.5 gigawatts of renewable energy to the company. This will help it create more power behind its artificial intelligence  growth . The stock remains a leading renewable energy supplier, while also being a strong dividend provider. Brookfield Renewable stock currently holds a 5.15% dividend yield. However, it aims to have annual increases between 5% and 9% over the next few years. This makes it an all-around attractive buy. Manulife Another great option for a long-time hold while also providing you with stable and growing dividends is  Manulife Financial  ( TSX:MFC ). Manulife stock currently holds a 4.55% dividend yield, which has been supported by its strong and growing insurance and asset management business. Manulife stock has proven over the last year to be one of the most stable stocks on the TSX today. Shares are up 38% in the last year, climbing to all-time highs. This occurred most recently after the company reported earnings. During the first quarter, Manulife stock reported revenue up 67% to $8.65 billion, with net income down 40% to $811 million. While these numbers were down from last year, it showed the company is forecast to grow revenue by 17% per year on average during the next three years. And that’s more than  double  the rest of the insurance industry. So, if you want a stable stock with even more stable dividends, Manulife is the stock for you."},

It’s crucial to identify companies positioned to grow their revenue and earnings sustainably, which should translate to share price appreciation. Here are three of the best Canadian stocks TSX investors can buy now. Aritzia stock Down 42% from all-time highs,  Aritzia  ( TSX:ATZ ) is valued at $3.4 billion by  market cap . Founded in 1984, Aritzia is a design house and one of the largest luxury brands in Canada. The drawdown in Aritzia’s stock price can be attributed to a deceleration of its top-line growth. For instance, the company grew its net sales by just 6% in fiscal 2024 (ended in February), down from 47% in fiscal 2023 and 74% in fiscal 2022. Moreover, an elevated cost environment weighed heavily on its profit margins as EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) fell 8.6% to $72.5 million, while adjusted net income declined by 18% to $38.2 million. Aritzia opened six new boutiques and repositioned three existing boutiques in premier real estate locations. The Canadian retail company executed a smart spending initiative, which should translate to annualized runrate savings of over $60 million from process optimization, vendor negotiations, and KPI (key performance indicator) improvements. It might seem the worst is over for Aritzia as analysts expect the company to increase revenue by 10.3% to $2.6 billion in fiscal 2025, while adjusted earnings are forecast to expand by 93.5% to $1.78 per share. So, priced at 19.4 times  forward earnings , ATZ stock is quite cheap and trades at a discount of over 25% to consensus price target estimates. Jamieson Wellness stock Valued at $1.19 billion by market cap,  Jamieson Wellness  ( TSX:JWEL ) stock trades 38% below all-time highs, increasing its dividend yield to 2.8%. Jamieson Wellness is among Canada’s largest vitamins, minerals, and supplements companies and is now gaining traction south of the border. In the first quarter (Q1) of 2024, Jamieson Wellness reported revenue of $128 million, down 6.4% year over year. While Jamieson Brands grew by 6.7%, its Strategic Partners business sales fell by 55.7% as the company prioritized branded shipments amid labour disruptions. JWEL stock is cheap. It is priced at 16.9 times forward earnings and is trading at a discount of 24.5% to consensus price target estimates. Alimentation Couche-Tard stock The final TSX stock on my list is  Alimentation Couche-Tard  ( TSX:ATD ), which has already created game-changing wealth for shareholders. Valued at $73 billion by market cap, ATD stock has returned 4,300% in the last 20 years after adjusting for dividends. Alimentation Couche-Tard is one of the largest retail companies in the world that operates in the convenience and mobility space with operations in 29 countries and close to 17,000 stores. In January 2024, it closed the acquisition of certain European retail assets from  TotalEnergies , expanding its store count by 2,175 locations. ATD has a strong track record of successful integrations and synergy realizations, which should help it improve earnings growth going forward. Analysts expect ATD to expand adjusted earnings to $4.34 per share in fiscal 2025 (ended in April), up from $3.9 per share in fiscal 2024. Priced at 17.4 times forward earnings, ATD stock trades at a discount of 12% to consensus price target estimates."},

Buy Galaxy Digital Instead", "title_link": "https://www.fool.ca/2024/05/13/missed-out-on-aurora-cannabis-buy-galaxy-digital-instead/", "published_date": "May 13, 2024", "publisher_name": "Adam Othman", "Description": "The cannabis industry in Canada experienced a modest revival in the last few weeks, including  Aurora Cannabis , which has risen by about 127% in less than two months. The bullish momentum of this and other  cannabis stocks  hasn’t yet waned, but it may have entered the normalization phase. It’s not too late to invest in the sector, but if you have missed out on the initial growth opportunity and are looking for a stock where you can get in on the next bullish momentum right from the beginning,  Galaxy Digital Holdings  ( TSX:GLXY ) is a good pick. Current performance of the stock Galaxy Digital Holdings has risen about 23% since the beginning of the year. The “growth” is minimal considering its returns when the crypto market or the stock itself is appropriately bullish. However, it does indicate that the stock is  still  moving in the right direction. The latter half of the growth momentum started in the second half of 2023, triggered by the growth of major cryptocurrencies like  Bitcoin . That makes the stock quite similar to cannabis stocks, which are also currently riding the last legs of waning growth momentum, but one thing that helps Galaxy Digital stock stand apart is its valuation.  With a price-to-earnings ratio of just 2.5, it’s currently one of Canada’s most undervalued stocks in the crypto industry. So, if there is a modest positive push in the crypto sector, like cryptocurrencies going up in price, the stock may experience a sizable surge. If you buy now, you can capture the upside of the next bullish surge from the beginning. Other factors to consider One of the reasons why Galaxy Digital is a great way to  invest in cryptocurrencies  in Canada or, more accurately, gain exposure to the crypto industry in Canada is its diversified business model.  Unlike crypto mining companies, which are Canada’s most common type of crypto stocks, Galaxy Digital offers its investors a relatively sheltered exposure to the crypto market, making it a bit safer than most other crypto stocks. Another factor that makes it a compelling pick is that its business model ideally positions it for a solid crypto economy. If crypto assets, investments, and holding become more mainstream and the need for crypto-related financial services increases, Galaxy Digital’s businesses will most likely thrive. This gives it more leeway to grow even when there isn’t a conventional crypto boom — i.e., the price of Bitcoin going up. Foolish takeaway If you have missed out on Aurora Cannabis or other cannabis stocks as they recently surged, you may anticipate a similar growth in an equally volatile sector like crypto. Galaxy Digital can serve as a powerful candidate in this regard. You may consider adding it to your portfolio for its next bullish phase."},

If yes, you should consider adding some  fundamentally  strong artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to your portfolio. AI is fast emerging as one of the most disruptive and innovative technologies of our time, and it has the potential to transform various industries and create new business opportunities and value. That’s why investing in an AI stock at the right time will give you exposure to this fast-growing and lucrative market while also diversifying your TFSA holdings. In this article, I will introduce you to one of the most attractive AI stocks in Canada that could supercharge your TFSA in the long term. A top Canadian AI stock for TFSA investors While there are many Canadian companies today that are leveraging AI technology to innovate and disrupt their industries, not all of them might be suitable for TFSA investors as they could increase your risk profile. That’s why TFSA investors should look for companies that have a proven track record, a strong competitive advantage, and a clear growth strategy. One such company is  OpenText  ( TSX:OTEX ), the Waterloo-headquartered information management company that primarily focuses on providing software and services to help enterprises manage, secure, and analyze their data. It currently has a  market cap  of $11.3 billion as its stock trades at $41.46 per share. After posting 39% gains in 2023, this AI-focused Canadian stock has seen about 24% value erosion so far in 2024, making this stock look even more attractive to buy on the dip based on its long-term fundamental outlook. The recent declines in OpenText’s share prices have also made its annualized dividend yield look even more attractive, which currently stands at 3.3%. Top reasons to buy this AI stock now The ongoing long-term growth trend in OpenText’s financials looks impressive. In the first three quarters of its fiscal year 2024 (ended in March 2024), the software company’s total revenue  surged  by 47.2% YoY (year over year) to US$4.4 billion with the help of continued improvement in its cloud revenues and enterprise cloud bookings. During these nine months, the company’s adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) also jumped by 51% YoY to US$1.5 billion. Similarly, its adjusted EBITDA margin in the latest quarter stood strong at 32%, far better compared to 29.3% from a year ago. Besides organic growth, OpenText’s operational strategy to focus on significant acquisitions and AI-driven enterprise cloud solutions brightens its long-term growth outlook. For example, at the start of 2024, the company introduced the latest advancements in its OpenText Aviator platform. This update emphasized AI-driven improvements in secure information management across various knowledge bases by offering scalable analytics and reducing operational costs with efficient data management. Another key factor that makes this AI-focused Canadian stock really attractive for TFSA investors is its continued focus on debt reduction. Last week, OpenText completed a significant debt reduction of US$2 billion, which highlights its management’s focus on minimizing long-term risks while maintaining AI-focused investments. Given all these positive developments, you can expect this AI stock to yield solid returns in the long run."},

At US$898.78 per share, the year-to-date gain and 3.01 overall return in 3.01 years are 81.5% and 507.97%, respectively. The price three years ago was only US$137.72. Many investors missed out on NVIDIA but would not take positions now. The strong AI foundation assures continuous growth, but the price is too high already. Fortunately,  Canadians  can invest in  Propel Holdings  ( TSX:PRL ) instead. The fintech’s growth trajectory is better, and the potential return could be far superior. Stock performance NVIDIA went public in January 1999, while Propel Holdings started trading on the TSX on October 20, 2021. Currently, Propel investors are up 116.64% year to date and partake in the modest 1.86% dividend yield. The trailing one-year price return is 335.9% versus NVDA’s 214.6%. Had you invested $6,500 in Propel one year ago, your money would be $28,335.94 today, excluding dividend earnings. The board of directors approved two dividend hikes in 2023. Fast-growing fintech Toronto-based Propel Holdings is very small compared to NVIDIA, but the $975.75 million financial technology company displays a high growth rate and solid financial position. Its innovative lending platform extends installment loans and provides credit lines to underserved Canadian and American consumers. The Financial Times  named Propel Holdings one of the top 500 companies in The Americas’ Fastest-Growing Companies 2023 ranking list. In addition to the organic, profitable growth, the ranking was a direct result of its AI-powered technology. Its chief executive officer, Clive Kinross, offered superior products to the underserved consumers that  traditional financial institutions  locked out. Kinross added that from 2019 to 2022, Propel’s cumulative annual revenue and net income growth were 49% and 96%, respectively. Launching multiple bank partnerships and new products during the period aims to expand the geographical footprint further. Exceptional start to 2024 The strong consumer demand led to stellar financial results in the first quarter (Q1) of 2024. In the three months ending March 31, 2024, revenue and net income increased 47% and 77% to US$96.5 million and US$13.1 million compared to Q1 2023. The provision for credit losses (PCLs) and other liabilities rose 36.1% year over year to US$42.4 million. Because of the strong credit performance across the loan portfolio and another quarter of record results, the board approved a 14% dividend increase. “The strong start to the year reflects both the economic health and resilience of the underserved consumer, particularly in the U.S. and our industry-leading AI technology platform that continues to bring more consumers,” said Kinross. Differentiators and growth drivers According to management, the AI-powered technology and a compliance-first approach are differentiators and growth drivers. continue to be the differentiator and driver of growth.

While this Calgary-headquartered company is not directly involved in oil and gas production, it operates a large network of pipelines that transport crude oil, natural gas, and other liquids across North America. Besides that, Enbridge has increased its focus on renewable energy projects, such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power generation, in recent years. Shares of Enbridge have jumped by more than 17% in the last six months to currently trade at $51.67 per share with a  market cap  of $109.8 billion. But is it still prudent to invest in Enbridge stock at the current level? Let’s take a closer look at some  fundamental  factors that could drive its future performance and dividend payouts. Enbridge’s strong earnings and profit margin In the last few years, volatile commodity prices and other macroeconomic concerns have affected the energy sector. Nonetheless, Enbridge’s long-term earnings growth trends still look impressive. To give you an idea about that, the company’s total revenue in the last five years slipped 6% from $46.4 billion and 2018 to $43.6 billion in 2023. Nonetheless, its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) during these five years increased by a solid 28% from $12.8 billion in 2018 to $16.5 billion in 2023. Its adjusted EBITDA margin in these five years also significantly expanded from 27.7% to 37.7%, reflecting its operational efficiency and economies of scale. On a similar note, Enbridge recently  reported  a solid start to 2024, with first-quarter adjusted earnings rising 8.2% YoY (year over year) to $0.92 per share. Its adjusted net profit for the quarter surged 13.3% to nearly $2 billion. Its strong net profit figures for the quarter were supported by a 10.9% increase in ENB’s adjusted EBITDA to roughly $5.0 billion, showcasing enhanced throughput gains across its liquid pipeline systems. To add optimism, Enbridge registered a strong 9% YoY increase in its distributable cash flow in the March 2024 quarter, due largely to higher system utilization driven by robust demand in key markets and operational enhancements. Is ENB stock still a good investment today? The answer to the question of whether Enbridge stock is still a good investment today depends on several factors, including your risk appetite and time horizon. If you’re looking to double or triple your money in a short period of time, you might be disappointed, as Enbridge is not a  high-growth stock . However, if you’re looking for a steady and reliable source of income with the potential for modest capital appreciation, then Enbridge might be a great fit for your portfolio. Besides its strong earnings growth trends, the company’s proactive strategic moves brighten its long-term growth outlook. For example, Enbridge recently completed the acquisition of The East Ohio Gas Company, now Enbridge Gas Ohio, from  Dominion Energy . This $6.6 billion acquisition is a strategic expansion of Enbridge’s natural gas distribution footprint in the United States. Moreover, ENB could be a great stock for long-term income investors as it has a nearly three decades-long track record of raising dividends and offers an attractive annualized dividend yield of 7.1% at the current market price."},

Due to the defensive nature of the underlying businesses,  TSX utility stocks  offer growth to investors through dividends supported by virtually guaranteed cash flows. However,  Algonquin Power & Utilities  ( TSX:AQN ) has disappointed investors for a while. As of this writing, Algonquin stock trades for $9.09 per share, up by 34% from its 52-week low but down by almost 60% from its February 2020 levels. Investors who own the stock from a few years ago might be worried whether holding its shares is still a good idea. Stock market investing is about looking ahead to see whether the investment can continue delivering returns in the long run. To this end, we will discuss how it might fare as a long-term holding. Interest rates and Algonquin’s troubles Due to historically low interest rates, downturns in the broader economy did not impact shares of utility stocks drastically for many years. However, the key interest rate hikes from the Bank of Canada (BoC) had a major impact on them this time around. Utility companies generate stable cash flows due to the essential nature of the services they provide. Regardless of how much consumers cut costs during an economic crunch, they cannot cut off utility services. It typically allows utility companies to earn virtually predictable revenues. However, utility companies also rely on heavy debt loads to support their businesses. With higher key interest rates, companies with variable interest debt loads suffered drastically. Algonquin took on too much variable debt to fund its aggressive strategy to grow its utility business and invest in renewable energy. When its dividends yielded 8.2%, Algonquin slashed its payouts by 40% along with firing its executive team to cut costs. Despite these measures, its dividend yield is creeping up again. As of this writing, it has a 6.48% dividend yield. Its payout ratio is estimated to be around 84% of its adjusted earnings this year. It means the company is less likely to slash dividends further. Central banks in the U.S. and Canada are expected to announce a reduction in key interest rates next month. If the company’s earnings remain stable, it can maintain a sustainable payout ratio. New management on the horizon It is clear that Algonquin has to make several changes to avoid being forced to cut dividends. Reducing its variable debt might be necessary, along with reducing its aggressive capital programs. Algonquin’s largest shareholder who owns around 9% of the company, might deliver a notice to nominate three director candidates in the company’s Annual General Meeting in June. Likely, the company will also sell off its renewable business to reduce debt and buy back shares. New management will likely be good for the company, as it opens the doors for fresh ideas to help improve business. Buying back shares right now can benefit the company due to its arguably undervalued share prices. Foolish takeaway Suppose you own shares of Algonquin stock from much higher levels a few years ago. It might not make sense to sell your holdings. The possibility of an improvement in its fortunes is there. However, it remains to be seen how the new management will enact changes. Until that happens, you can continue getting returns through its high-yielding dividends. Once the situation improves, you can also enjoy growth through capital gains. There is a risk that it might face more short-term challenges. If the  uncertainty  feels too risky to stay invested, finding other alternatives in the same industry might be a better idea."},

Zooming out on its stock chart below, investors can see a consistent and rather incredible long-term trend of up and to the right. That’s the kind of performance investors want to see from the  growth stocks  in their portfolio, and this company has certainly proven to be an excellent long-term investment.  The question is whether this performance is bound to continue or if investors may simply be taking too much risk investing at what appears to be the top of a giant mountain. Let’s dive in.  Constellation Software is a tech stock to behold There are a number of shining examples of tech companies that produce the kinds of returns Constellation Software has over the years. However, the company’s business model is one that’s sustainable, and continued to produce incredible results year in and year out. Constellation essentially acquires smaller and medium-sized software companies, incorporating them into a growing portfolio of solutions it sells its clientele. Focused on both public and private organizations, Constellation has been able to increase the return on invested capital for its acquisitions due to the network effects generated by its core business.  This has led to a growth-by-acquisition model with an incredible forward runway. The software market remains highly fragmented, and Constellation stands to benefit from continually consolidating this space. I think this is a stock with plenty of runway to continue growing for the next decade or two at or around its current clip. Why Constellation Software remains a buy The company’s core business model should propel similar results we’ve seen historically moving forward. In the case of this growth stock, there’s a level of reliability and stability to this growth picture that’s hard to come by in the market.  I also think Constellation is relatively undervalued compared to other U.S.-based companies due to being domiciled in Canada and primarily traded on the TSX. Given the lofty valuations in this space and expectations that multiples could expand when interest rate cuts come into play, I think the timing is right to add to CSU stock over time. I think this is a stock best owned and not traded. Accordingly, investors may want to dollar cost average in over time when thinking about how to build a position in this expensive stock."},

And when the time is right, the money we set aside for investments is spent. Are you stuck in this circle? While it is true that you can’t time the market, it is also true that buying the dip and selling the rally of  fundamentally strong  stocks gives the best results. Instead of waiting for the stock in your watchlist to come to the right price, you could identify value stocks when you have the money to invest.  Two TSX stocks to buy right now with $1,000 Invest only the money you don’t need immediately, as stocks are  volatile  in the short term. They might reduce your invested amount instead of growing it initially. But with time, they can grow your investment severalfold.  I have identified two growth stocks trading closer to their 52-week low. They are currently oversold amid economic uncertainty. However, they have the financial flexibility to thrive and a secular demand that could trigger high growth. BlackBerry stock BlackBerry  ( TSX:BB ) stock has slipped below the $4 price, losing more than 40% of its market value in the last 12 months. Investors have been selling the stocks while its major shareholder, Prem Watsa, continued adding more BlackBerry shares to its portfolio through  Fairfax Holdings . The short term is difficult for the cybersecurity management company as the uncertain business environment has kept governments and companies cautious with their IT spending. Hence, BlackBerry expects its cybersecurity revenue to fall in 2024 as well. However, the company has a bright side of growth in the form of QNX software and IVY vehicle communications that fall under its Internet of Things (IoT) segment. BlackBerry expects revenue growth in IoT as it realizes the royalty backlog from the last two years from the pent-up design wins. Its QNX royalty backlog stands at US$815 million in fiscal 2024.  Moreover, BlackBerry operates in two high-growth segments: the IoT,  with  a total addressable market (TAM) of US$32 billion in 2025, and endpoint cybersecurity, with a US$52 billion TAM in 2026. This secular growth shows the long-term outlook is bright. The company is undergoing restructuring to tap this growth efficiently and with positive cash flow.  You could consider buying this stock as it trades closer to its 20-year low because of the short-term headwinds. If the growth catalysts trigger, the stock could even cross $40 in the long term. A $500 investment could become $5,000. Even if BlackBerry doesn’t thrive, its rich intellectual property (IP) could fetch a premium from any acquirer interested in buying the company or its IP. In either case, you could get more than your invested amount.  Hive Digital Technologies  Hive Digital Technologies  (TSX:HIVE) is another stock worth buying right now. This blockchain technology company has turned into a digital solutions company. It has a dual growth opportunity of  Bitcoin  and artificial intelligence (AI). Since April 26, the stock has slipped 22% below its low-end range of around $4. The stock price is influenced by Bitcoin price momentum, which depends on economic growth and investor confidence.  While the stock market surged in May on hopes of a June interest rate cut, Hive stock continued to fall. The market has not yet priced in the optimism. If the Bank of Canada does announce a rate cut in June, Hive stock could jump significantly and even grow your money by more than 50% in a few months. While the Bitcoin angle brings capital appreciation and volatility, the AI component could bring stability to the cash flow. Hive realized that it needed to diversify its revenue streams. It is renting out its graphic processing data centres for AI and high-performance computing. This could bring stable revenue over time and reduce the stock’s downside. Hence, buying the stock at the dip will reduce your downside and increase your upside.  Investor takeaway  The above stocks are highly volatile and can give market-beating returns in a recovery rally. However, they are best purchased at the dip, which is right now. Once they rally, the risk will increase."},

There are plenty of reasons for that view, and more than a few REITs to buy hand over fist this month. Here’s a look at a trio of REITs investors will look to buy hand over fist right now. Consider this REIT for buy-and-forget income Let’s start our list of REITs to buy hand over fist with  RioCan Real Estate  ( TSX:REI.UN ). RioCan is one of the largest REITs in Canada, with a portfolio of nearly 190 properties across the country. RioCan’s portfolio has leaned towards commercial and retail properties, but in recent years, that mix has shifted to include mixed-use residential properties. RioCan calls those RioCan Living, and they represent an opportunity for investors looking at REITs to buy hand over fist. That’s thanks to a few key reasons. First, there’s the lack of housing in Canada’s major metro areas. This is pushing first-time homebuyers outside of metro areas where costs are more affordable. In contrast, RioCan’s growing residential portfolio is focused on key spots in metro areas, specifically along transit corridors where commute times are minimal. Second, this caters to a shift away from traditional retail brick-and-mortar retail. The mixed-use properties in the RioCan Living portfolio comprise residential towers sitting atop several floors of retail. Again, the prime location comes into play. Finally, we have the risk of investing itself. Compared with a traditional downpayment on a rental property, investing in RioCan can provide a juicy income with only a fraction of the investment and risk. Speaking of income, RioCan offers a monthly distribution that currently boasts a yield of 6.27%. This means a $40,000 investment in RioCan will generate a monthly income just shy of $210. Speaking of retail… Not all of the commercial retail segment is witnessing a decline. Some superb brands continue to grow strongly, and some of those properties are owned by  CT REIT  ( TSX:CRT.UN ). For those unfamiliar with the REIT, CT has a portfolio of over 370 properties stretching across the country that collectively boast a leasable area of over 30 million square feet. Among the core tenants in that portfolio is  Canadian Tire ,   which also happens to be the controlling unitholder. Both work in lockstep to bolster growth and provide a very appetizing monthly distribution. That growth includes a whopping $150 million spent last year to add over 800,000 square feet to its massive portfolio. And despite that immense growth, the REIT still boasts over 99% occupancy. Turning back to income, as of the time of writing, CT boasts a juicy 6.65% yield, handily making it one of the REITs to buy hand over fist right now. Prospective investors will also love that CT does provide bumps to that distribution. In fact, the most recent bump was a 3% increase announced just this month. Some food for thought (and income) Some of the best long-term options for investors, which include the REITs to buy hand over fist, are what I like to call  everyday stocks . These are companies that represent businesses that we interact with daily. This not only gives them somewhat of a  defensive moat  but can also be a long-term driver of growth. Enter  Slate Grocery  ( TSX:SGR.UN ), which is the third REIT to buy hand over fist right now. Slate invests in grocery-anchored real estate sites. Grocery stores are highly defensive and less likely to change over or close down like other retail segments. Toronto-based Slate owns over 110 properties located across the U.S. market. These provide Slate with a steady source of revenue, which the company then uses to invest in improvements and new acquisitions, which drive rent prices higher. The result is a defensive REIT that boasts massive long-term growth that pays out a juicy distribution. As of the time of writing, that distribution is an insane 10.96%. Part of the reason for that massive yield is that the stock price has dropped a whopping 23% in the trailing two years. Still, investors looking to buy REITs hand over fist should keep in mind that Slate is a long-term option that can provide substantial income."},

Having alternative means of income to supplement your primary income is necessary to meet your needs. While working more than one job is a possibility, creating a  passive-income  stream is a better idea to achieve financial freedom. To this end, investing in the stock market can be an excellent approach. Using your money to buy and hold dividend stocks gives you the chance to use your money to make more. Allocating your money to dividend stocks that increase payouts can help you keep pace with and even beat inflation. Here are two TSX dividend stocks with high dividends you can consider adding to your portfolio. Fortis Fortis  ( TSX:FTS ) can be an excellent investment if you want to generate passive income through stock market investing. Fortis is a conglomerate that owns and operates several utility businesses in Canada, the U.S., Latin America, and the Caribbean. Serving around 3.4 million customers, it generates most of its revenue through long-term contracted assets in highly rate-regulated markets. Its business model allows Fortis stock to generate predictable, recurring, and stable revenue. The defensive nature of its business allows Fortis stock to pay generous dividends to its shareholders, which it keeps increasing each year. Fortis is a Canadian Dividend Aristocrat with an over 50-year streak of dividend hikes. As of this writing, it trades for $55.48 per share and pays its investors at a juicy 4.25% dividend yield. Due to its excellent track record, Fortis stock is a staple in many investment portfolios focused on generating a passive income. Restaurant Brands International Restaurant Brands International  ( TSX:QSR ) might not be a familiar name for many people, but it is the owner of some of the biggest names in the international restaurant industry. The quick-service restaurant network boasts names like Burger King, Tim Hortons, Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, and Firehouse Subs under its belt. RBI stock generates revenue from royalty fees on sales and sales from company-owned locations. It also generates significant revenue from leases in franchised locations worldwide. As of this writing, RBI stock trades for $100.82 per share and pays its investors at a 3.14% dividend yield. The company plans to open around 7,000 new locations worldwide in the next five years. The goal is to reach system-wide sales of $60 billion by 2028. Backed by solid revenues and the potential to generate even more in the coming years, RBI stock can be an excellent dividend stock for earning a passive income. Foolish takeaway These two  dividend stocks  look well-positioned to increase payouts to shareholders in 2024. With plans and the ability to grow their business, Fortis stock and Restaurant Brands International stock can potentially grow shareholder value. Buying and holding shares of these two stocks in your self-directed portfolio can help you generate a passive income to meet your financial goals."},

Though investors did not seem at all impressed (the post-earnings reaction seemed to suggest some investors were panicking just a little bit), I didn’t think the numbers were brutal — not in the slightest. Believe it or not, Shopify actually beat earnings estimates. But shares flopped anyway as management cautioned about its coming second quarter. In any case, the stock was still somewhat expensive, and expectations were simply too high going into the latest number, especially given plenty of macro headwinds that are still out there. Though the bull market in stocks may suggest investors are upbeat about where economic growth goes from here. In any case, the going isn’t cleared yet, and until it is, investors will need to brace themselves for big bumps in the road. As it stands, shares of SHOP are now sitting down just over 21% in the past week.  Shopify stock back at $80: Is this a buying opportunity? With SHOP stock going for $80 and change per share, I view the dip as potentially intriguing for brave investors who still believe in the firm but are willing to forgive it for having more than its fair share of stumbles. As a high-flying growth company, the stock is bound to be an extreme mover during earnings season. Just as the stock could pole-vault by a high double-digit percent, shares could also stumble by similar magnitudes.  With shares having shed close to a third of their value off February 2024 highs, it makes a ton of sense to revisit the name and ask yourself, “Has anything  fundamental  changed about the long-term growth story?” I’d argue that nothing major has changed about Shopify, with shares now rapidly on the retreat. That said, there’s really no telling how long this dip can go. Though the second quarter will probably require investors to revisit the drawing board (logistics business sales will take away from growth), I still believe in the multi-year growth thesis. With generative artificial intelligence technology thrown into the mix, I’d argue there’s a high chance this recent plunge could prove a great time to be a net buyer.  Of course, you’re going to have to face the pain and negative momentum head-on. For many  new  investors, that’s just too scary to do. Though I’m not against waiting for the dust to settle, I’d prefer going for more of a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) approach. Think of it as slowly moving into the shallow end of the wave pool so you have a far lower risk of drowning once the tides begin to get a bit rougher. The Foolish bottom line on Shopify stock Shopify stock is no stranger to volatility. The recent quarterly beat was good, but investors were more concerned about the pains to come. Now that many will expect a bit less from the next quarter, shares are less risky than they were at more than $100 per share.  When you sign up for Shopify, you’re getting impressive growth prospects and visionary leaders. However, you’re also signing up for wild swings to the magnitude of 30% or more every so often. Shopify is still one of the country’s top innovators, but unless you’re willing to embrace a rough patch here and there, perhaps the stock is not right for you."},
{"source_name": "The Motley Fool", "title": "Is Shopify a Millionaire-Maker?", "title_link": "https://www.fool.ca/2024/05/13/is-shopify-a-millionaire-maker/", "published_date": "May 13, 2024", "publisher_name": "Chris MacDonald", "Description": "Formerly the quintessential “millionaire-maker” stock,  Shopify  ( TSX:SHOP ) trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange as one of the most traded stocks in the market. It has seen incredible  growth , with SHOP stock rising an impressive 3,400% since its IPO, and at its peak, it soared an incredible 6,031%. To put that into perspective, your $10,000 initial investment in Shopify might have grown to more than $600,000. Those who have held since its IPO and put $30,000 into the stock are currently millionaires.  Now, this stock is down considerably from its peak. And despite a recent pullback, it’s still a highly valued company, making these sorts of returns unlikely moving forward. But for those with enough fresh capital to put to work, it does appear Shopify can be a millionaire-maker stock over the long term.  Let’s dive into why. Understanding Shopify  Shopify provides a robust e-commerce platform designed mostly for small- and medium-sized enterprises. Its subscription solutions, which are split into two sectors and accounted for 43% of sales in the fiscal year 2018, allow merchants to perform e-commerce on a variety of platforms, including their websites, physical stores, pop-up shops, kiosks, and even social media sites like Facebook and  Amazon . To help with e-commerce operations, its merchant solutions – which accounted for 57% of fiscal 2018 revenue – offer add-on products like Shopify Payments, Shopify Shipping, and Shopify Capital. As the e-commerce economy grows, Shopify stands poised to capture significant market share and grow its revenue and earnings at a market-beating rate. Those who have bet on the company to do so have been well-rewarded, but it’s clear the size of the total pie and Shopify’s dominance are growing. If the company can rival Amazon in the e-commerce space over the long term (a big ask, I know), it’s entirely possible another growth wave could take this stock much higher over the long term.  Is now the time to buy Shopify? The pandemic produced quite an incredible boost for Shopify, with the company seeing triple-digit revenue growth and producing consistent profits. The growth bar has been considerably lowered for the company as these pandemic-driven headwinds have waned. Accordingly, the company’s valuation is much more in line with its future growth prospects than it has been in a long time. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 62 times, Shopify stock looks reasonably valued, given the growth potential the company provides. Shopify’s retail sales penetration rate of 15% in North America is strong, though this number dips to 2% globally. The question is how quickly and aggressively Shopify can gobble up global market share. The company’s potential for exponential growth will likely continue to be driven by innovation and development strategies, including the integration of AI into its platform. Bottom line Over the long term, I like Shopify’s positioning in the e-commerce market. This is a sector that simply doesn’t get the love it deserves right now. Given where interest rates are and the dynamics in the market, that makes sense. But if we do see interest rates come down and a resurgence of growth stocks in the market, Shopify stands poised to capture big gains for investors. Whether that means it’ll make any individual investor a millionaire depends on the amount invested and the price paid. But right now seems like a decent time to get into this high-growth player, in my view."},

With rate cuts likely on the way before the end of 2024, bargain hunters are wondering which Canadian dividend stocks with high yields might be  undervalued  right now and good to buy for a self-directed Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) or Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) portfolio. Enbridge Enbridge  ( TSX:ENB ) is up about 12% over the past few weeks, but at $51 per share the stock is still well below the $59 mark it hit in 2022, so more gains could be on the way in the coming months. Enbridge is picking up a tailwind from two sources. First, investors are beginning to move back into dividend-growth stocks ahead of the anticipated rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada. Lower rates will reduce borrowing costs and help drive better profits for companies like Enbridge that use debt to fund their large capital projects and acquisitions. Anticipated growth in natural gas demand might be another reason for the renewed buying of ENB stock. Enbridge has extensive natural gas transmission networks that move 20% of the natural gas used in the United States. In addition, the company is set to become the largest natural gas utility operator in North America once it completes the $14 billion acquisition of three U.S. natural gas utilities.  Data centres for artificial intelligence use a lot of power and are expected to grow steadily in the coming years. Renewable energy expansion likely won’t keep pace and power sources like solar and wind can be unreliable. Natural gas is abundant in the U.S. and Canada and is a cleaner alternative to oil and coal when burned to produce power.  Enbridge has a $25 billion capital program on the go that will help drive 3-5% annual growth in distributable cash flow in the coming years. This should support dividend increases in the same range. Enbridge raised the payout in each of the past 29 years. At the time of writing the stock provides a 7.1% dividend yield. Bank of Nova Scotia Bank of Nova Scotia  ( TSX:BNS ) trades near $65 per share at the time of writing. It dipped to $55 in late October last year but is way off the $93 it reached in early 2022. Rising interest rates are largely to blame in this case, as well. However, the concern among investors has been that a recession could occur as the central banks try to cool off the economy to get inflation back down to the 2% target. If rates remain too high for too long, the banks risk seeing a surge in loan defaults from businesses and households. Provisions for credit losses are already increasing. In the event there is a surge in unemployment while rates are still too high, a flood of bankruptcies could occur. At this point, however, economists broadly expect the central banks to navigate a soft landing for the economy as the begin to reduce interest rates, likely in the second half of this year. Assuming this scenario pans out, Bank of Nova Scotia is probably cheap today, and investors should see its share price drift higher. Investors who buy BNS stock at the current level can get a 6.5% dividend yield. The bottom line on top TSX dividend stocks Enbridge and Bank of Nova Scotia pay attractive dividends that should continue to grow. If you have some cash to put to work in a portfolio focused on high-yield dividends, these stocks deserve to be on your radar."},

The  S&P/TSX Composite Index  is up 2.7% this month. Amid the improving investor sentiments, I believe the following three  value stocks  could deliver superior returns over the next three years. goeasy goeasy  ( TSX:GSY ) has outperformed the broader equity markets this year, with returns of 17.6%. However, it trades at an attractive valuation, with an NTM (next-12-month)  price-to-earnings  multiple 11.1. As of December 31, the subprime lender has acquired just 2% of the $218 billion Canadian subprime leading market. So, its scope for expansion is higher. Meanwhile, the company is expanding its product offerings and delivery channels and strengthening its digital infrastructure to grow its footprint and market share. Further, the company has tightened its credit tolerance by increasing required credit criteria and made several credit adjustments across the product suite, which could lower its risks. Meanwhile, goeasy’s management projects its loan portfolio to increase by 56% over the next three years to reach $6 billion by 2026. Also, its revenue could grow at 12.9% annually while its operating margin could expand from 38.1% to 41% in 2026. goeasy has been raising its dividends at an annualized rate of around 30% since 2014, while its forward yield stands at 2.54%. Considering all these factors, I am bullish on goeasy. Suncor Energy Oil prices have strengthened this year amid the extension of voluntary production cuts by OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) and its allies and the conflict in the Middle East. Although oil prices have cooled down substantially over the last few days, they are still higher year to date. Higher oil prices could benefit oil-producing companies like  Suncor Energy  ( TSX:SU ). Meanwhile, Suncor Energy reported an impressive first-quarter performance yesterday, with its adjusted funds from operations growing by 5.6%. Increased oil sand sales volumes and higher refinery throughput, with its utilization rate at 98%, drove its financials. However, lower price realization and increased royalties offset some of the growth. Further, Suncor Energy has planned to invest around $6.3-$6.5 billion this year, strengthening its production and refining capabilities. It expects its average upstream production to be 770,000-810,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with the midpoint representing a 5.9% increase from the previous year. Its refinery utilization rate could improve from 90% in 2023 to 92-96%. Higher production, increased refinery utilization rate, and elevated prices could drive Suncor Energy’s financials in the coming quarters. Despite its healthy growth prospects, the company trades at 9.9 times analysts’ projected sales for the next four quarters. It also offers a forward  dividend  yield of over 4%, making it attractive. WELL Health Technologies Another value stock I am bullish on would be  WELL Health Technologies  ( TSX:WELL ), which has lost around 36% of its stock compared to its 52-week high. Weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings have weighed on its stock price, dragging its NTM price-to-earnings multiple down to 13.2. Meanwhile, digitizing clinical procedures and the growing adoption of virtual healthcare services have created a multi-year growth potential for WELL Health. The company is also developing artificial intelligence-powered products and services and making strategic partnerships that could expand its footprint. Also, WELL Health has adopted several cost-optimizing initiatives that could improve its operational efficiency and profitability in the coming quarters. Considering all these factors, I believe WELL Health would be an excellent buy despite near-term volatility."},

AtkinsRéalis  ( TSX:ATRL ), formerly SNC-Lavalin, continues to win contract awards in the engineering and construction industry.  Mattr Corp.  ( TSX:MATR ), formerly Shawcor, is now a growth-oriented, global materials technology company serving critical infrastructure markets.  NexGen Energy  ( TSX:NXE ) is developing the Rook I Project, the world’s largest, low-cost producing uranium mine.   Multiple contract wins AtkinsRéalis is always in the news due to successive contract awards. In 2023, service revenue and backlog rose 20.8% and 16.1% year over year to record highs of $8 billion and $13.7 billion. Notably, adjusted net income climbed 143% to $274.1 million versus 2022. Its president and chief executive officer (CEO), Ian L. Edwards, noted the exceptional results across businesses and in core geographies. The $9.44 billion fully integrated professional services and project management company operates globally but has implemented a new operational structure to sustain growth. AtkinsRéalis won a $40 million contract to provide general engineering services for the Georgia Department of Transportation. The operations and maintenance work at the Centre Hospitalier de l’Université de Montreal, one of Canada’s largest hospital centres, spans 26 years.   The most recent contract win is for the new Île d’Orléans Bridge developed by Quebec’s Department of Transportation and Sustainable Mobility. ATRL trades at $53.15 per share and pays a modest 0.15% dividend. But with multiple contracts pouring in, expect the share price to soar in 2024 and beyond. Significant opportunities Last year was a breakout year for Mattr. Besides the revenue rising 7.4% year over year to $925.3 million, net income reached $87.2 million compared to the $30.9 million net loss in 2022. The $1.1 billion company operates a network of fixed manufacturing facilities and derives revenue from the Composite Technologies and Connection Technologies business segments.  Mattr is present in the communication, electrification, energy, transportation, and water management markets.

TFSA or RRSP? The Canadian government launched the TFSA in 2009 to give people another option for saving funds to meet financial goals. Until that time, most people used their  Registered Retirement Savings Plan  (RRSP) to build a personal retirement portfolio to go along with work pensions, Canada Pension Plan (CPP), and OAS. The RRSP is still a valuable option for savers, particularly when they find themselves in a high marginal tax bracket. RRSP contributions can be used to reduce taxable income for the relevant tax year. With a bit of careful planning, the idea is to withdraw RRSP funds in retirement when your marginal tax bracket is much lower. Money removed from the RRSP is taxed as income. Investors who are in the early years of their careers and expect to have much higher income down the road might decide to save RRSP contribution space for later to maximize the benefit of the tax reduction. Instead, investments can be made inside a TFSA.  The TFSA offers good flexibility for people who might need to tap the savings. Funds can be pulled out at any time and the full amount of the money removed during the year opens up equivalent new contribution space in the following calendar year. RRSP withdrawals, in contrast, are subject to a withholding tax and you don’t get the contribution space back if you need to pull the money for an emergency. TFSA contributions are made with after-tax funds, but any interest, dividends, or capital gains that are generated inside the TFSA can be removed tax-free, so the full amount can go right into your pocket.  OAS clawback People who expect to receive a good company pension, CPP, and OAS in retirement have to be careful not to let their RRSP portfolio get too big. The government requires retirees to shift RRSP savings into a  Registered Retirement Income Fund  (RRIF) by December 31 of the year they turn 71. After that time, a minimum amount has to be taken out every year. This is taxable income, just like income received from CPP, OAS, and a company pension, so a person could potentially find themselves at a higher marginal tax bracket in retirement than when they made the initial RRSP contributions while they were working. In addition, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) implements a 15% OAS pension recovery tax on every dollar of net world income that is above a minimum threshold. The number to watch in the 2024 tax year is $90,997. So, a person who receives OAS and has net world income of $100,997 this year would see their OAS reduced by a total of $1,500 for the July 2025 to June 2026 payment period. Passive income coming from a TFSA is not counted by the CRA towards the net world income total. Good TFSA investments for passive income  The TFSA limit is $7,000 in 2024, bringing the cumulative maximum TFSA contribution room per person to $95,000. People who want zero risk can simply put the money in Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs) from issuers that are Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation members. There is a $100,000 limit per issuer, but it is easy to spread savings out to make sure your funds are safe. GIC rates have pulled back from the highs reached late last year but are still attractive. Owning stocks comes with capital risk, but returns can be higher. Top dividend-growth stocks sold off over the past two years and currently offer good yields.  TC Energy  ( TSX:TRP ), for example, has increased its dividend annually for more than 20 consecutive years and expects to provide ongoing yearly increases of 3-5%, supported by its capital program. The stock trades near $52.50 at the time of writing compared to more than $70 in 2022. Investors who buy at the current level can get a 7.3% dividend yield. The bottom line on top TFSA passive income Investors can quite easily put together a diversified portfolio of high-yield dividend stocks and non-cashable GICs that would provide an average yield of at least 5% today. On a TFSA of $95,000, this would generate $4,750 in annual tax-free passive income that won’t put OAS at risk of a clawback or bump you into a higher marginal tax bracket."},

It’s just the latest for not just TELUS stock but the  telecommunication  sector in general. So, what should investors consider when it comes to TELUS stock? Is the outlook so terrible they should sell? Or is the share price a deal on the TSX today? Buy For investors considering buying TELUS stock, there are certainly many factors to consider. For instance, TELUS stock has consistently demonstrated robust customer growth across its mobile and fixed services, setting quarterly and yearly records. This indicates the company’s ability to attract and retain customers, which is crucial for long-term revenue growth and profitability.  Despite fluctuations in net income due to various factors such as restructuring costs and depreciation, TELUS has shown overall growth in operating revenue, adjusted  earnings  before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), and free cash flow. This suggests the company’s ability to generate strong cash flows and maintain financial stability. What’s more, TELUS stock provided clear financial targets for the future, including revenue and EBITDA growth projections. The company’s stable outlook and commitment to its dividend-growth program provide investors with confidence in its long-term prospects. Hold Still, there are also reasons why investors may want to wait before buying more or, indeed, selling. In this instance, its dividend growth is a large factor. TELUS stock has a history of increasing its dividend payout, which is attractive to income-oriented investors. The company’s commitment to its dividend-growth program, supported by its strong financial performance and free cash flow expansion, makes it an appealing choice for investors seeking reliable dividend income. This is currently at a yield of 6.68%. Furthermore, TELUS demonstrates financial discipline through its cost-saving initiatives and efficiency programs, resulting in margin expansion and strong free cash flow growth. This disciplined approach to financial management contributes to the company’s overall stability and resilience in various market conditions. Finally, there could be more growth coming in the future. TELUS stock continues to invest in technology, such as its PureFibre network, to enhance its service offerings and improve customer experience. Holding Telus stock allows investors to participate in the company’s technological advancements and innovation initiatives, which could drive future growth and profitability. Sell That being said, investors have every right to be a bit fearful of the future. Despite strong revenue and EBITDA growth, TELUS stock has experienced a significant decline in net income over the reported quarters. In the third quarter of 2023, net income was lower by 75%, and in the fourth quarter of 2023, net income decreased by 50% compared to the previous year. While there was an increase in net income in the first quarter of 2024, the trend of declining net income in previous quarters could raise concerns among investors about the company’s profitability.  Telus attributed the decline in net income to higher efficiency-related restructuring costs, depreciation, amortization, and financing costs. And despite strong operational performance, net income has fallen on an annual basis. Finally, while TELUS stock increased its quarterly dividend over the last few quarters, the rate of dividend growth has slowed down compared to previous years. This could be interpreted as a signal that the company’s management is becoming less confident in its ability to sustain higher dividend payouts, which might disappoint income-oriented investors. Bottom line Investors will need to consider their own risk tolerance before considering TELUS stock further. The company continues to hold a strong market position and improve operational performance. However, even a 6.68% dividend yield may not be enough to keep investors around—not until they see more improvements in future guidance."},

However, finding high-quality TSX stocks that pay monthly dividends is not easy, as most companies distribute their profits quarterly or semiannually. Moreover, some monthly  dividend stocks  have unsustainable payout ratios or weak financial foundations, which could affect their future distributions. That’s why investors need to be careful and selective when looking for monthly dividend stocks to add to their portfolios. In this article, I’ll highlight two ultra-high-yield monthly dividend stocks that have strong business models, solid financial performance, and attractive long-term growth prospects. Allied Properties REIT Allied Properties REIT  ( TSX:AP.UN ) is a Toronto-based, open-ended real estate investment trust (REIT) that specializes in managing and developing urban office environments in Canada. Its focus on converting light industrial structures into modern office spaces, primarily in central business districts, provides a unique niche that appeals to a range of professional and creative industries, making its business model reliable through consistent demand for centrally located office spaces. This monthly dividend stock currently has a  market cap  of $2.4 billion as its stock trades at $17.35 per share after declining by nearly 20% in the last year. These declines in its share prices, however, have made Allied’s annualized dividend yield look even more attractive, which currently stands at an impressive 10.5%. In the first quarter of 2024, Allied  reported  an operating income of $78 million from continuing operations, up 2% YoY (year over year). Despite some setbacks due to a fair value loss on investment properties in Toronto, Edmonton, and Montréal, the REIT maintained solid funds from operations at $81 million, while its adjusted funds from operations saw a slight uptick to $75 million from $74 million, indicating a resilient underlying operational efficiency. As the trust remains focused on strategic portfolio optimization and enhancing user experiences to boost demand for its diverse categories of workspace, Allied Properties REIT could be a reliable long-term monthly dividend stock to invest in now. Freehold Royalties stock Freehold Royalties  ( TSX:FRU ) is another high-yield dividend stock in Canada that pays monthly dividends. It currently has a market cap of $2.1 billion as its stock trades at $14.14 per share after rising by 4.4% over the last three months. At this market price, FRU stock has an impressive annualized dividend yield of 7.7%. In the March quarter, Freehold generated $74 million in revenue and reported funds from operations totalling $54 million, or $0.36 per share. The company’s total production stood at 14,714 barrels of oil equivalent per day, maintaining stability across its operations despite severe weather impacts in North America. To add optimism, its production mix remained heavily weighted towards oil and natural gas liquids last quarter, comprising 63% of the total output, which should help it expand its margin in the near term. Besides these positive factors, Freehold’s high-quality, oil-weighted assets in North America, and continued focus on new quality acquisitions brighten its long-term growth outlook, making this monthly dividend stock attractive to buy now and hold for years."},

Of course, growth drivers and disruptive innovations can be the formula for market-beating gains. But if you’re late to a trade (let’s say after a more than 100% pop in a year or less), the risks of overpaying are real. And if you take a big loss in your TFSA, you won’t be able to offset gains elsewhere in other accounts.  Though it’s tempting to chase hot stocks, I’d argue your TFSA should be left for the  cheapest  stocks that can help enjoy capital appreciation and dividends for years (or decades). Remember, it’s the long-term game that really counts! In this piece, we’ll check in on two value stocks on the TSX that I think would be good fits for TFSA investors looking to double down on value as certain portions of the market (most notably artificial intelligence, or AI, driven tech) get a tad lofty, with rallies that may be getting long in the tooth.  The following plays, unlike the high-momentum AI stocks, are relative laggards. And while they may have their fair share of issues, I view them as solvable and more than priced into shares at this pivotal moment. Let’s check in with the names already. Spin Master Spin Master  ( TSX:TOY ) stock has held onto that sinking feeling since April struck. With shares now at $29 per share following the latest reaction to a tough quarter that saw the firm lose almost US$55 million, I think long-term value investors have plenty of reason to jump in right here, even though Spin’s become more of a falling knife than a stock stuck trading sideways.  Though the reaction to the number was mixed to negative, I think that there is hope as Spin looks to do its best to weather what remains of the industry hailstorm. You can’t really blame Spin for the rough patch. The toy industry seems to be in shambles these days. The good news is Spin still has the means to wheel and deal as the industry continues taking jabs to the chin.  The recent Melissa & Doug (a children’s toy maker) acquisition helped give a nice jolt to quarterly sales. And as Spin is a known consolidator of legendary toy brands, I’d look for the firm to explore more synergy-rich opportunities out there. Don’t expect any such deals to pay off overnight, though, as Spin is very much a long-term value play. Aritzia Aritzia  ( TSX:ATZ ) stock has been back on the retreat over the past week, now down more than 10% since its May 7th monthly high. The women’s clothing retailer recently received some praise from fellow Fool contributor  Karen Thomas , who’s bullish on the company in the second half as it looks to hang onto gross margin gains. Indeed, I think Thomas is right in that Aritzia is a better buy relative to the likes of other high-end apparel retail plays right now, while macro headwinds are still weighing heavily. Though it could take time for Aritzia to gain traction again after that sharp January spike, I think the odds are in favour of the bulls in the second half, especially if industry dynamics improve and the firm has a chance to flex recent operating efficiency improvements."},

Led higher by the broader recovery in U.S. market indices, the TSX certainly looks to be in good shape as it moves on from a few years of relative stagnation.  Undoubtedly, just because the stock market is doing well does not mean Canada’s economy is in the clear. Still, many pundits agree that the Bank of Canada may be closer to cutter interest rates than the U.S. Federal Reserve. Inflation certainly does not seem to be tame, at least when you head on over to the local retailer or grocery store.  That said, the rate of price increases has come down quite a bit in recent quarters, even if we’re still feeling the pain from the last two years of elevated inflation. Undoubtedly, just because the pace of price hikes is slowing does not mean the days of 2019-20 prices are going to return. Until there’s some sort of deflation (that’s negative inflation in which prices fall), such prices may never return.  In short, slowing inflation is less likely to be felt after a prolonged period of inflation. Deflation would cause the perception that inflation is under control. The battle with inflation has been rough on consumers With a Bank of Canada that’s probably fine cutting interest rates when inflation returns to the 2% range, though, it’s hard to tell if the stage could be set for such a scenario. And as wage increases in response to inflation begin to set in, there may be no looking back to the great pre-pandemic, pre-inflation prices that we all have longed for. Further, just because deflation would be appreciated at the local grocer doesn’t mean it’s necessarily good for the economy’s long-term future. In the meantime, though, deflation seems to be far less horrid than inflation.  Personally, I think the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) could pave the way for deflation at some point down the road. However, until AI really starts to earnings considerable cash flows for firms, 2% inflation (what we’re used to) is likely to become the norm again. For now, consumers will need to live with the scars of inflation, which may take a heck of a lot longer to get used to. In any case, here’s one TSX stock that’s been a great friend to Canadian consumers (and investors) amid inflation and will likely continue to be for many years to come.  Dollarama: Bang for your buck as inflation’s scars linger Enter  Dollarama  ( TSX:DOL ), a discount retailer that continues to offer great bargains for those seeking great deals and a means to dodge the blow of inflation.  As mentioned previously, inflation has winded down quite a bit of late. However, the scars of inflation will continue to be sore for many consumers over the medium term. What does that mean for the top discount retailer in Canada? Good business over the foreseeable future as the firm looks to expand its footprint and probably continue gains for investors, especially those with DOL stock in their  Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs) ! Dollar stores seem to be a dime a dozen (forgive the pun) in the U.S. market. To truly stand out, a discount retailer needs to be well-run, with some of the best supply-side deals out there. That’s what helps a retailer offer consumers bang for their buck.  As it’s one of the best-managed discount retailers, I continue to view DOL stock as a great buy as it continues its run to new highs. At writing, shares are at new heights, and they’re still a buy. TFSA  investors , take notice!"},

Typically, growth stocks command premium valuations during  bull runs  and trail the broader markets significantly when sentiment turns bearish. So, if you expect the equity markets to move higher through 2030, holding quality growth stocks such as  Lululemon  ( NASDAQ:LULU ) and  Docebo  ( TSX:DCBO ) in a TFSA ( Tax-Free Savings Account ) might be a great strategy. The TFSA was introduced in 2009 and allows Canadian investors to benefit from tax-free gains for life. You can hold qualified investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds in a TFSA and create a diversified portfolio while sheltering your returns from Canada Revenue Agency taxes. The TFSA contribution limit in 2024 has increased to $7,000. Here’s why you should consider investing $500 in Docebo and Lululemon right now. Lululemon is down 31% from all-time highs Valued at a  market cap  of US$44 billion, Lululemon stock has returned roughly 2,400% since its initial public offering in July 2007. Despite these market-thumping gains, Lululemon stock trades 31% below all-time highs, allowing you to buy the dip. Lululemon stock lost over 16% in a single trading session following its fiscal fourth quarter (Q4) of 2024 (which ended in January). In Q4, Lululemon reported revenue of US$3.21 billion and adjusted earnings of US$5.29 per share. Comparatively, analysts forecast revenue at US$3.19 billion and earnings at US$5 per share.  While Lululemon beat consensus estimates in Q4, it issued disappointing guidance as it expects to see soft sales in the United States. Lululemon emphasized it is wrestling with uncertain demand and lower discretionary spending due to an uncertain macro environment. For instance, in the Americas, Lululemon sales were up just 9%, compared to a 29% growth in the year-ago period. Alternatively, the pullback in LULU stock allows you to buy a quality stock at a discount. Priced at 24.7 times  forward earnings , LUU stock is forecast to expand earnings by 11.3% annually in the next five years. Analysts remain bullish on LULU stock and expect shares to surge over 30% in the next 12 months. Is Docebo stock a good buy right now? Docebo is a Canada-based company that offers e-learning solutions to enterprises. Valued at $1.4 billion by market cap, DCBO stock is down 46% from all-time highs. In Q4 of 2023, Docebo reported subscription sales of US$46.5 million, up 28% from the year-ago period. Subscription sales account for 94% of revenue, allowing Docebo to generate stable cash flows across business cycles.  Similar to other asset-light tech companies, Docebo enjoys high profit margins, ending Q4 with a gross margin of 81.2%. However, unlike several other growth stocks, Docebo is now reporting consistent profits, ending Q4 with an adjusted net income of US$8.3 million or US$0.26 per share, up over 100% year over year. Additionally, Docebo reported a free cash flow of US$7 million, indicating a margin of 14.2%. Analysts now expect Docebo’s earnings to take off due to its high operating leverage. Bay Street forecasts Docebo to improve earnings from US$0.08 per share in 2023 to US$0.73 per share in 2024 and US$1.14 per share in 2025.  DCBO stock might seem expensive at 64 times forward earnings, but it trades at a 20% discount to consensus price target estimates."},

And no wonder. After years of volatile growth, it’s time to look at ETFs that can provide you with far safer growth. This comes from purchasing an entire portfolio of equities, bonds, and more with the click of a button. However, not every ETF is perfect. In fact, you’ll still need to do your research to come up with a diversified range of ETFs that will fit exactly what you want. Even still, if you have $100 to spend, these are the three I would pick up for the perfect diversified ETF portfolio. Growth If you’re looking for growth over the next few years, then you’re going to want an actively managed ETF. These are ETFs that are managed by a team of professionals. While this does mean there are higher commission fees, it also means that you could see more growth as they are rebalanced regularly. A strong choice in this case is  CI First Asset Tech Giants Covered Call ETF  ( TSX:TXF ). This ETF seeks to provide investors with exposure to the performance of a portfolio consisting primarily of equity securities of technology companies while generating additional income through a  covered call  options strategy. As to strategy, the ETF primarily invests in large-cap technology companies that are considered leaders in their respective industries. These include the “Magnificent Seven” companies in the United States, and other major players in the tech sector. Shares of the ETF are up 35% in the last year alone and climbing. Plus, there is the addition of a 6.96% divided yield for added income. Income Speaking of income, another ETF that investors will want to focus on is one that provides solid income. While growth might be far lower, you can look forward to  fixed income  often on a monthly basis — all while seeing far lower commission fees since these typically are not actively managed funds. In this case, I would consider  BMO Ultra Short-Term Bond ETF  ( TSX:ZST ). This ETF aims to provide income with capital preservation by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of short-term, fixed-income securities. The fund aims to maintain a low duration, which refers to the sensitivity of bond prices to changes in interest rates.  By focusing on short-term bonds, the ETF aims to mitigate interest rate risk while providing investors with a source of regular income. Because of the low duration in which it holds bonds, it is less sensitive to changes in interest rates. This feature can be appealing to investors seeking to minimize interest rate risk. So, while you won’t see returns really from this investment, you can grab a stable dividend at a 4.97% yield. Diversification Now, investors will want to round this out with exposure to a diversified ETF that can provide a strong core for your overall portfolio. To do this, you’ll likely want to invest in an ETF that doesn’t include Canada. Because Canadians tend to be heavily invested at home, you want exposure to everything else. A great option in this case is  Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap ex Canada Index ETF  ( TSX:VXC ). The ETF seeks to provide long-term capital growth by replicating the performance of the FTSE Global All Cap ex Canada Index. The ETF invests in a broad range of global equities, excluding Canadian stocks, to provide investors with exposure to companies across developed and emerging markets worldwide. This approach offers diversification across geographies, sectors, and market capitalizations. It really offers the best of everything. You get exposure to global investments and emerging markets. There is comprehensive coverage from small to large-cap stocks. And it’s low-cost. Plus, dividends are reinvested back into the fund for even more long-term potential. So, with shares up 20% in the last year and a 1.55% divided yield, it’s the perfect way to round out your long-term growth."},

With higher interest rates available today, investors want to be well-compensated for the long-term capital they invest. The highest-interest one-year  Guaranteed Investment Certificate  (GIC) offers a rate of about 5%, while the five-year GIC rate is about 4.5%.  GICs are considered risk-free investments in that you’re guaranteed to get your principal back safe and sound. That’s not the case for stocks. In the worst-case scenario, investors could lose their entire stock investment if the underlying business goes under. Thankfully, the  top TSX stock  I’m going to talk about is a well-run business that shares profits with its shareholders. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners  ( TSX:BIP.UN ) has created wealth for long-term investors since it began trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2009. Since then, it has grown investors’ money 13-fold — growing an initial investment of $1,000 into approximately $13,350. BIP.UN Total Return Level data by YCharts Its five- and 10-year total returns are about 14% and 8.6%, respectively, per year, growing an initial investment of $10,000 into about $37,040 and $15,090, respectively. Its three-year rate of return of 2.2% barely made investors money — perhaps investors with a sharp eye would say it, at best, kept up with the long-term rate of inflation.  Is the utility stock losing its touch? Actually, the stock peaked in early 2022 before it began a downtrend from central bank interest rate hikes since 2022. For example, in Canada, the policy interest rate rose from 0.25% to 5.0%, which is a rapid increase. Any company that’s leveraged, including BIP, which has sizeable debt, would naturally see a selloff in its stock. Generally speaking, higher interest rates mean higher interest expenses and a higher cost of capital, leading to slower growth. BIP still has an investment grade S&P credit rating of BBB+. Operational-wise, Brookfield Infrastructure continues to do a fabulous job. For 2023, it reported funds from operations per unit (FFOPU) growth of 9% and a payout ratio of 66%, which was within its long-term target range of 60-70%. The utility reported first-quarter (Q1) 2024 results, including FFOPU growth of 8% with the help of 7% of organic growth. This is within management’s expectation of an organic growth of 6-9% per year across its diversified portfolio of global infrastructure assets.  Its Q1 supplemental information also notes that it has ample liquidity of US$2 billion. Moreover, its ongoing capital-recycling program is expected to lead to proceeds of about US$2 billion in any given year. Additionally, it targets a long-term return on invested capital of 12-15%. As well, it has a well-laddered debt profile that has an average term to maturity of about seven years with largely predictable interest expenses, as approximately 90% of its debt is a fixed rate. And it has no significant debt maturities this year. Specifically, roughly 4% of its asset-level debt will mature over the next 12 months; only half will refinance at higher rates.  Despite BIP having its debt largely at the asset level, it doesn’t change the fact that higher interest rates weigh on the stock’s valuation. This is actually good for long-term investors because they can now accumulate shares in the  top utility stock  at a discount  and  higher yield.  At $41.70 per unit, the stock offers a cash distribution yield of 5.3%. Analysts also think that’s a nice discount of over 20% with the potential for up to 30% of upside over the next 12 months. Allowing more time for the business to grow could lead to greater wealth creation.  Importantly, the utility has a track record of increasing its cash distribution. (For your reference, its five-year cash distribution growth rate is 6.3% per year.) The stock pays well for investors to sit on its shares. If it continues to grow its cash distribution at a 6% clip, the yield on cost would be over 7% in five years. Combining its attractive valuation, yield, and above-average growth prospects, BIP has the potential to outperform its peers and the market over the long run."},

After falling over 50% during the bear market of 2022, NVDA stock has surged more than 500% since the start of 2023. Valued at a market cap of US$2.24 billion, Nvidia is now among the largest companies in the world and has returned a staggering 20,000% to shareholders since May 2014. As past returns don’t matter much to current investors, lets see if Nvidia stock should still be part of your equity portfolio right now. Nvidia is part of a rapidly expanding addressable market Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a megatrend that is here to stay and is potentially the biggest tech advancement the world might ever see. Nvidia is positioned to benefit from AI as the chip manufacturer’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, are used to power a wide range of AI applications in data centres. Compared to peers, Nvidia’s GPU chips are energy efficient and can process calculations faster, making them ideal for training data-heavy AI models. In fact, Nvidia’s GPU share in the AI chip market is forecast between 80% and 90%, making it an enticing investment even in 2024. Advanced Micro Devices  chief executive officer Lisa Su expects the AI chip market to surpass US$400 billion by 2027. In 2023, Nvidia’s data centre business generated US$47.5 billion in sales. So, if Nvidia can maintain a 40% market share in this business, data centre sales might reach US$160 billion by 2027. Nvidia’s sales increased from US$16.67 billion in fiscal 2021 (which ended in January) to US$60.9 billion in fiscal 2024. It is forecast to report revenue of US$112 billion in 2025 and US$140.36 billion in 2025. Moreover, adjusted earnings are forecast to expand from US$12.96 per share in fiscal 2024 to US$65 per share in fiscal 2029.  So, if NVDA stock is priced at 30 times forward earnings, it may trade at US$1,950 per share in May 2028, indicating an upside potential of over 100%. Diversify your AI portfolio While Nvidia remains a compelling investment in 2024, investors can consider diversifying their AI portfolio by purchasing shares of companies such as  UiPath  ( NYSE:PATH ). Valued at US$11 billion by  market cap , PATH stock is down 77% from all-time highs, allowing you to buy the dip. UiPath is an enterprise-facing software platform that automates business processes. It serves sectors such as healthcare, telecom, finance, and banking and provides automation services for processes such as accounts payable, claims processing, contact service, and accounting. In the fiscal fourth quarter (Q4) of 2024 (which ended in January), UiPath reported annual recurring revenue of US$1.46 billion, up 22% year over year. A steady stream of recurring sales should allow UiPath to generate cash flows across business cycles. Unlike other growth stocks in the AI space, UiPath is reporting consistent profits, ending Q4 with an operating margin of 4%. Analysts tracking UiPath expect it to end fiscal 2029 with adjusted earnings of US$3.6 per share. If the tech stock is priced at 30 times  forward earnings , it should trade at US$108, indicating an upside potential of over 450% from current prices."},

The most prudent companies grow their dividends per share as their earnings per share (EPS) or free cash flow per share (FCFPS) also grow. It is a way of rewarding shareholders, maintaining capital discipline, and still ensuring growth and investment in the business. You will have to sacrifice dividend yield for the best quality businesses. However, it is worth in the long run. A stock with a small yield but a fast-growing dividend can become a substantial income stream over time. The best part is that you are much more likely to also earn strong capital returns with this strategy.  As a result, investors get a great one-two punch. If you are looking for stocks that could have substantial dividend hikes in 2024, here are three to think about today.  An energy stock with monstrous dividend growth If you want to project future dividend growth, past dividend growth can sometimes be a good indicator.  Canadian Natural Resources  ( TSX:CNQ ) has an incredible dividend track record. It has increased its annual dividend for 24 consecutive years by a 21% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). For an energy stock, that is incredible. Oil and gas are volatile and cyclical commodities. Canadian Natural has compiled a portfolio of assets with multiple decades of  energy reserves . It could easily double its production capacity if it had pipeline egress. Canadian Natural just hit its long-term $10 billion debt target. It plans to distribute all its excess cash to shareholders.  So, that means big share buybacks, dividend increases, and special dividends are on the table going forward. It just increased its base dividend by 5% in February 2024. It yields 3.8% right now. A tech stock with a fast-growing dividend Enghouse Systems  ( TSX:ENGH ) is a stalwart in the  Canadian technology  scene. It was one of the first Canadian companies to utilize a software acquisition and consolidation strategy. Recently, growth has moderated due to increased competition and macro issues. The stock hasn’t performed well. Despite, the business continues to generate a massive amount of cash. Every quarter it kicks out between $18 million and $30 million of excess cash. Enghouse is sitting with $240 million of net cash on its balance sheet. It continues to hold that largely for acquisitions. However, Enghouse has steadily been growing its dividend. Over the past 10 years, it increased its annual dividend by 18% CAGR. It increased its dividend by 18% in its most recent quarter. It yields 3.5% today. A financial stock with a low payout ratio With a  market cap  of $3.2 billion,  EQB  ( TSX:EQB ) (also known as EQ Bank) may not be a part of the “Big Six” Canadian bank list. However, it has been one of the best-performing bank stocks. Its stock is up 133% in the past five years. In that period, its EPS is up 92% and its annual dividend per share has increased by 104%. The bank has done a good becoming a contender with its online-only banking products and specialized loans catered to new Canadians. The bank raised its dividend by 12% last year. With an earnings payout ratio of 11%, it has ample room to keep increasing its dividend. With a growing population, EQ Bank still has a great opportunity to take market share. It yields 2% today."},

The  S&P/TSX Composite Index  slipped by 67 points, or 0.3%, in the last session to settle at 22,309 but still managed to end the week with strong 1.6% gains. Even as largely upbeat earnings drove the shares of consumer noncyclical and utility companies higher, heavy losses in  technology stocks  pressured the TSX benchmark during the session. According to Statistics Canada’s latest report, the country’s unemployment rate  remained  unchanged at 6.1% in April, while employment increased by 90,000 jobs due mainly to a surge in part-time roles. Top TSX Composite movers and active stocks CI Financial  ( TSX:CIX ) tanked more than 12% to $14.72 per share, making it the worst-performing TSX stock for the day. This selloff in CIX stock began after the Toronto-headquartered wealth and asset management firm released its first-quarter earnings report. In the quarter ended in March, the company’s revenue  rose  1.2% year over year to $645.7 million but fell short of Bay Street analysts’ expectations of $700.2 million. Despite an 18.6% increase in its total assets, CI Financial’s adjusted net quarterly profit fell 2.9% from a year ago to $132.8 million. In the second quarter so far, CIX stock has now slipped 15% and offers an annualized dividend yield of 5.4%. NexGen Energy ,  Ballard Power Systems , and  Baytex Energy  were also among the bottom performers on the  Toronto Stock Exchange , as they dived by at least 8% each during the session. On the flip side, shares of  IAMGOLD  ( TSX:IMG ) jumped by 11.4% to $5.87 per share after the precious metals mining company  announced  stronger production and revenue for the first quarter. Higher-grade mining at its Essakane mine and record output at the Westwood mine helped the company reduce 151,000 ounces of gold last quarter, driving its quarterly revenue up by 68.9% year over year. Sienna Senior Living  and  Jamieson Wellness  also rallied by at least 4.2% each, making them among the session’s top-performing TSX stocks.

In the last five, 10, and 20 years, it delivered annualized total returns of approximately 10.3%, 11.1%, and 12.3%, respectively. To be more concrete, it turned an initial investment of $10,000 into roughly $16,290, $28,680, and $102,230, respectively. A good portion of these returns came from its dividend, which RBC has increased over time. Currently, the stock offers a dividend yield of 3.9%. Since the Canadian banking leader pays a safe dividend, the dividend yield is a good gauge of the stock’s valuation.  Here’s a 10-year history of the stock’s dividend yield range and quarterly dividend. The current dividend yield indicates that the stock is not exactly a bargain. Based on the decade’s yield history, RBC stock is likely a good buy whenever it offers a dividend yield of close to 5%. RY Dividend Yield data by YCharts Let’s take an actual look at its valuation. At about $141 per share at writing, which is a price to book of about 1.8 times. In recent history, it dipped to below 1.6 times book.  RY Price to Book Value data by YCharts At this quotation, it trades at a blended  price-to-earnings ratio  of approximately 12.5 times, which aligns with its long-term normal valuation. Both valuation metrics suggest a stock that’s not cheap. Analysts agree that the stock is fairly valued as the  TMX Group  website has a consensus 12-month price target of $143.40 on the stock.  This means there’s no margin of safety in the stock. It doesn’t mean that owners of RBC stock should sell immediately because there’s value in earning a perpetual income. For example, investors who bought RBC shares about 15 years ago are sitting on a yield on cost of about 11.8%. Imagine earning a +11.8% return on your investment perpetually (no matter what the economy or financial markets are doing). Besides, its long-term returns from current levels aren’t bad. Assuming a fairly valued stock and the bank is able to grow its earnings per share by about 6% per year going forward, long-term investors could still get long-term returns of more or less 10% when combining price appreciation from earnings growth and its dividend.  In most years, the  Canadian bank stock  maintains a payout ratio of about 50%, which protects its dividend and allows for dividend growth over time, along with earnings growth. Investors need to beware of economic downturns, which would be a drag on RBC’s earnings. That said, even during recessions, RBC’s earnings have been resilient. Today, the bank operates a diversified business, consisting of about 39% revenue generation from personal and commercial banking, 31% from wealth management, 20% capital markets, and 10% insurance, based on fiscal 2023 revenue.  In today’s higher interest rate environment, Canadians are experiencing higher interest rates, which could lead to higher levels of bad loans, especially if a recession occurs. This is why it’s also unlikely RBC shares will head much higher over the next 12 months.  All in all, RBC stock appears to be a “hold” at current levels because shares are fully valued, but it pays out a safe and growing dividend, offering a decent dividend yield of 3.9%. On dips of 10% or more (or a price target of below $127) within the next year is a good starting point to consider accumulating shares."},

While shares of this financial services company have appreciated significantly, there are compelling reasons to buy goeasy stock as if there’s no tomorrow. In this article, I’ll discuss three reasons that make goeasy a must-own  Canadian stock .  Before I dig deeper, investors should note that goeasy offers leasing and lending services to subprime borrowers. Operating under three distinct brands — easyfinancial, easyhome, and LendCare — the company provides a range of financial solutions, including unsecured and secured loans, lease-to-own services, and point-of-sale financing, including buy-now-pay-later options. goeasy’s success stems from its ability to consistently grow its revenue and earnings at a solid pace. Investors should note that goeasy’s revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) have grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% and 28.6% between 2013 and 2023.  The company’s performance has been even better in recent years, which indicates that goeasy’s sales and EPS growth rate have accelerated. For instance, over the past five years (ending March 31, 2024), goeasy’s revenue has risen at a CAGR of 20.03%. Meanwhile, its EPS grew at a CAGR of 32.2%. Thanks to its solid financials, goeasy stock has registered notable growth, making its investors rich. goeasy stock has surged by nearly 1,111% over the past decade, reflecting a CAGR of over 28%. Moreover, in the last five years, the stock experienced a CAGR of about 31.6%, generating an impressive total return of about 296%. With this background, let’s look at three things that make goeasy an attractive investment.  Market dominance and solid growth potential goeasy is a leader in Canada’s subprime lending market. Thanks to its omnichannel offerings, wide product range, geographical expansion, and diversified funding sources, goeasy is poised to capitalize on the large non-prime lending market.  goeasy’s leadership highlighted during the recent quarterly conference call that the company is witnessing solid momentum across its several products and acquisition channels, including unsecured lending and automotive financing.  The increase in loan originations will likely drive its loan portfolio and revenue growth. Solid revenue growth, stable credit and payment performance (showcasing goeasy’s ability to manage credit risk effectively), and improving operating efficiency will likely lead to stellar earnings growth and drive its share price. goeasy stock offers high dividend growth Thanks to its  solid fundamentals  and strong earnings base, goeasy has consistently increased its dividend rapidly, making it a compelling investment for income investors. It’s worth highlighting that goeasy became part of the  S&P/TSX Canadian  Dividend Aristocrats  Index  in February 2020 as it increased its dividend at a CAGR of 42% over the prior five years.  Since 2020, goeasy’s dividend increased by about 113% to $0.96 in 2023. Furthermore, this financial services company increased the quarterly dividend to $1.17 per share, up 21.9% from $0.96 in February 2024. This marked goeasy’s 10 consecutive years of dividend growth.  goeasy’s valuation is attractive  goeasy stock has appreciated quite a lot over the past year. Nonetheless, the stock is trading at an attractive valuation. It is trading at the next 12-month  price-to-earnings  multiple of 10, which is lower than its historical average. Moreover, it appears low considering goeasy’s solid double-digit earnings-growth rate and a dividend yield of 2.6%.  Bottom line goeasy’s ability to grow its revenue and earnings at a double-digit rate, focus on enhancing shareholders’ return with high dividend growth, and compelling valuation make goeasy a buy near the current levels."},

Air Canada  ( TSX:AC ) was riding high on 27 consecutive quarters of profits and revenue growth before the novel coronavirus breakout. Canada’s flag carrier has reported first-quarter losses since that fateful year except one. Net income in Q1 2023 reached $4 million as passenger revenue reached a record $4 billion. However, on May 2, 2024, Air Canada reported a net loss of $81 million in Q1 2024. The share price fell 8.4% to $18.75 and hasn’t climbed above $20. As of this writing, AC trades at $18.80 per share. Based on market analysts’ 12-month average price target of $27.56, the  upside potential  is 46.6%. Financial highlights Michael Rousseau, President and CEO of Air Canada, said the airline’s solid first-quarter results position it for strong performance this year. In the three months ending March 31, 2024, operating revenue and free cash flow (FCF) increased by an identical 7% year over year respectively to $5.2 billion and $1.01 billion. Total liquidity was $10 billion at the quarter’s end. Mark Galardo, head of Air Canada’s Revenue and Network Planning, said cargo is a good complimentary business. Unfortunately, despite higher volumes, revenues from the segment declined $23 million year over year due to softer yields. He expects global cargo flows to improve by adding the Boeing 787-10 aircraft to the cargo fleet. For passenger travel, Air Canada is arranging lease agreements for the delivery in 2024 and the placing into service of additional Boeing 737 MAX 8s pending reconfiguration completion. Business outlook Air Canada acknowledged that pent-up demand for post-pandemic travel has receded in the first quarter of 2024 after two years of boom. Also, Canada’s premier airline company didn’t experience a bounce back in business travel like its U.S. counterparts  Delta Air Lines  and  United Airlines . “As expected, pent-up demand and ‘revenge travel’ factors are slowing over time,” said Galardo. In addition to thinner margins on sales, the $6.7 billion airline company is contending with supply chain problems that forced the grounding of six to seven planes. Nonetheless, a Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) report is an encouraging sign. GBTA forecasts Canadian business travel to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2024. It should reach US$25.9 billion, representing 13.5% annual growth. The global and U.S. growth forecasts are 11.8% and 9.2%, respectively. Air Canada notes the healthy demand across the system, owing to booking curves in spring and summer. However, it won’t match or approximate the demand environment, strong yields, load factors, or challenge capacity in 2023. The domestic network should strengthen in Q2 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023. Base year Performance-wise, the stock has yet to take off with the pent-up demand or revenge travel. Air Canada reached $29.80 on March 15, 2021, but can’t sustain the momentum. Also, the 12-month average price target is too optimistic. Even improved full-year financial results will not guarantee a breakout. Moreover, during the earnings call, Rousseau said that 2024 is the base year on which to rebuild."},

However, there are a few specific stocks that are currently waving major red flags. For beginners in particular, it’s crucial to know which stocks might be risky or unstable—essentially, the ones that could be considered sinking ships. In this article, I’ll highlight a stock that I believe is best avoided in 2024 due to its concerning fundamentals. Alongside these, I’ll share one stock that stands out as a solid choice that I personally plan to buy and hold forever.  A used video game pawn shop Do you have fond memories of  GameStop ( NYSE:GME)? I certainly don’t — I still remember feeling ripped off for my used Xbox 360 games when I was a teenager.  Despite its controversial history, GameStop is still hanging on. Following the infamous 2021 short squeeze, now-chief executive officer Ryan Cohen used the opportunity to dilute shareholders — affectionately known as “the apes” — to raise a war chest of cash that has kept the company afloat. Since taking the reins, Cohen has aggressively cut costs by closing stores and reducing employee benefits while desperately searching for a new business angle. Unfortunately, all attempted pivots have flopped.  Their NFT marketplace? Closed. Initiatives to transform GameStop into an e-commerce powerhouse through distribution centres? Failed. Playr, its platform for Web 3.0 gaming? Kaput. Despite these setbacks, the stock recently surged over 60%, with no significant news to justify the rise. This surge can likely be attributed to GameStop’s very active, some might say cult-like, group of shareholders who continue to buy shares and patronize the stores in a show of support.  Funnily enough, its prophet, “DeepF***ingValue,” or “DFV,” recently liked some movie on Twitter and tweeted a picture, and the apes believe it’s a sign that another “Mother of All Short Squeezes” or “MOASS” is just around the corner. I think it’s a total “nothingburger” but expect heavy volatility.  However, from an investment perspective, GameStop is a stock I’d avoid. The company struggles with negative free cash flow, declining revenues, a niche market, an outdated brick-and-mortar sales model, and, according to its employee forum on Reddit, poor morale.  What I would buy instead I have a deep appreciation for  The Coca-Cola Company  ( NYSE:KO ), a cornerstone in my (and  Warren Buffett’s ) investment portfolio.  Since its inception in 1886, Coca-Cola has become a global icon, and there’s a good chance you’ve recently enjoyed one of its many products. It’s the kind of stock I buy regularly, and I would eagerly increase my holdings if market conditions were to dip significantly. Coca-Cola stands out as one of the most shareholder-friendly companies I’ve encountered. With a management team committed to maintaining robust profit and operating margins and a return on equity consistently in the double digits, it’s a powerhouse of financial health.  Then there’s the amazing dividend — a reliable 3.10% yield at present, backed by an impressive history of 62 years of consecutive growth. Who doesn’t love getting paid to own a piece of a quality company? However, it’s important to note that quality like this doesn’t come cheap. Coca-Cola is rarely undervalued, and with a forward  price-to-earnings ratio  of 22.22, the  earnings yield  stands at about 4.5%. Ideally, I’d like to see this rise above the current 10-year Treasury yield, also at 4.5%, to consider it a screaming buy. But since timing the market is notoriously challenging, I’m not waiting around. I’m continuously buying shares of Coca-Cola, enjoying both the dividends and the great taste of its beverages along the way."},

Down 9.7% when the TSX financials subindex is up 5.12%, it is underperforming by 14.82%.  If you’ve been following the news on TD stock recently, you’ll probably have some idea as to why this is happening: the money-laundering investigation. The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) found several TD branches aiding a U.S. money-laundering ring in 2022. TD’s stock experienced some volatility when all of this came to light. Things started getting  extremely  ugly when the  Wall Street Journal  reported that the DoJ’s investigation related to alleged fentanyl dealing. Supposedly, TD employees helped Chinese traffickers launder funds. This news triggered a 6% one-day selloff. Flash forward to today. TD stock is currently at $77.38, up 3.5% from its lows set a few days after the  WSJ  story broke. Things look better than they did a few days ago. But will TD fully recover? In this article, I will explore that question, ultimately concluding that the nation’s second-largest bank  will  recover, but maybe not quickly. Reasons for the selloff TD Bank’s recent selloff was directly attributable to the  WSJ’s  reporting. There was no other material news about the company at the time the story broke, so either a major investor sold to raise money for something else or the bad news caused investors to change their minds about TD.  Looking a little further back, some weakness in TD Bank stock was observed due to poor earnings performance two quarters ago. The company reported some non-recurring expenses that caused its profit to decline, although earnings shot back up in the subsequent quarter. How TD is responding to the investigation TD appears to be cooperating with the U.S. DoJ. The bank’s public statements have a tone of “we need to do better,” and it is already booking money related to potential future fines. So far, TD has booked $450 million. It says that it expects to book more than that because other investigations are underway. $450 million is simply a floor estimate.  National Bank  analyst Gabriel Dechaine recently said he expected TD to pay $2 billion. That figure is being widely quoted and appears to be a “consensus estimate” among Canadian bankers. TD stock: Valuation in light of the investigation Currently, TD stock trades at 9.97 times earnings and 1.28 times book value. This valuation makes TD among the cheapest banks in  its peer group . Apart from TD, large North American banks spent the last six months rallying. Reasons for this bank rally included flattening of the treasury yield curve, high growth in investment banking fees, and fading memories of the Spring 2023 banking crisis. At the lows in 2023, big banks traded at less than 10 times earnings on average; today, they’re around 12.5 times earnings. Foolish takeaway TD is clearly cheap, going by today’s price and last year’s earnings. The question is whether coming fines will diminish its earnings power enough to negate the cheap trailing valuation. If it only takes $2 billion in total fines (the expert consensus), then TD’s forward price-to-earnings ratio is 12.5, assuming earnings are otherwise unchanged. In this scenario, TD is valued much like its peers are.  But if the money-laundering scandal spirals into a massive series of fines, then TD could still be too expensive. A lot rests on whether TD pays just the expected $2 billion or ends up in a  Wells Fargo- style multi-year scandal, with fine after fine being added as more jurisdictions seek a piece of the pie. This fact makes TD stock riskier than average. Personally, I’ve been buying TD stock. The investment will succeed if we get the consensus scenario rather than the worst-case scenario. However, I wouldn’t recommend this stock to an average investor, at least not at an above-index weighting.

What happened that made shares of the business jet maker defy the market and surge to their new 52-week high? Two events made shareholders optimistic. First is the positive first-quarter  earnings  on April 25, followed by  Investor Day  2024 on May 1.  Bombardier’s first-quarter earnings highlights  The first quarter was comparatively weaker on the revenue and aircraft delivery front. Bombardier’s revenue fell 3% as it delivered 20 aircraft instead of 22 in the previous year’s quarter, but its aftermarket revenue surged 12.5%.  In the current market scenario, investors are prioritizing profitability and debt over  revenue  growth. Bombardier’s earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margin increased to 11.1% from 9.5% a year ago despite a revenue decline. The jet maker has been growing its  profit margins steadily  by reducing debt and targeting medium and large aircraft.  The company’s priority of reducing its debt has helped it upgrade its credit rating. In May, Moody’s  upgraded  Bombardier to a B1 rating with a stable outlook. A ratings upgrade will help the business jet maker extend the US$2 billion worth of debt maturing in 2026 and 2027 to a longer term.  Bombardier’s order book  At the end of the first quarter, Bombardier’s order backlog increased by 5% to US$14.9 billion from US$14.2 billion a year ago. In a separate press release on May 1, the company revealed that NetJets was the client who placed an order for 12 mid-sized Challenger 3500 jets worth US$326.4 million in December 2023. The original agreement gives NetJets an option to order up to 232 Challenger 3500 aircraft. If NetJets exercises its options over time, the transaction could be worth more than US$6 billion based on list prices.  Beyond Challenger 3500, Bombardier is also looking to boost its order book by bringing into service the Global 8000, its next-generation large-body aircraft. The company is also targeting the Defense segment and pre-owned aircraft market to achieve its 2025 objective of US$9 billion in revenue and 150 deliveries. These segments require less investment and generate high returns.  Bombardier’s Investor Day 2024 highlights  Investor Day threw light on Bombardier’s long-term roadmap to 2030. The company showed a pragmatic picture wherein the aircraft deliveries will stagnate to 150 units a year. In such a scenario, it will focus on its existing aircraft and try to earn more from them.  The Pre-Owned program takes the used Bombardier aircraft, assesses their quality, makes repairs, and re-sells them. Beyond 2025, Bombardier might consider mergers and acquisitions in the Defense and Aftermarket space to boost growth.  In the 2020-2025 period, Bombardier’s management focus is debt reduction, and stable and positive free cash flow generation. Beyond 2025, the management will focus on return on capital creation while continuing to reduce debt. The company will look to generate higher returns for shareholders through share buyback and dividends from surplus cash. This long-term vision drove the stock to its new high.  Should you buy, sell, or hold the stock at its all-time high? The recent uptick in the share price comes as Bombardier’s long-term roadmap defies the current macro weakness. However, short-term headwinds of economic weakness and high interest rates could pull the stock down on any macro update.  If you had purchased the stock at around $50 to $55, you could sell some stocks and book profits. However, if you are invested for the long term, Bombardier stock could give you stable double-digit compounded annual growth through 2030. You could consider buying the stock at the next dip when short-term headwinds influence the stock price."},

Moreover, one can start investing in stocks even with low capital. What’s important is to consistently invest in shares of  fundamentally strong  companies and stay invested for a long period.  So, if you plan to invest in stocks with $100, here are two no-brainer  Canadian stocks  to consider.  Stock #1 The TSX has several high-quality stocks, one of which is  Aritzia  ( TSX:ATZ ). This luxury clothing company has a stellar track record of generating impressive sales and earnings, which has bolstered its share price.  For instance, Aritzia’s revenues have grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% in the past five years. This was supported by solid e-commerce sales, which increased at a CAGR of 37% during the same period. At the same time, its adjusted net income grew at a CAGR of 13%.  Despite tough year-over-year comparisons, Aritzia’s sales grew at a healthy pace in Q4 (fourth quarter) of fiscal 2024. Its revenue increased by 7% in Q4, on top of the 44% growth registered in the prior-year period. This shows the company’s ability to attract shoppers even amid macro uncertainty.  Aritzia’s management expects its top line to increase at a CAGR of 15 to 17% through 2027, which implies that its growth rate will likely accelerate from current levels. Its focus on introducing new styles and applying data analytics and technology will likely optimize its product portfolio and accelerate its growth rate. Moreover, the opening of new boutiques augurs well for growth. Aritzia aims to launch 8 to 10 new boutiques annually through FY27.  The company plans to further benefit from enhancing its online customer experience by expanding omnichannel offerings and broadening its product range. Overall, Aritzia’s focus on expanding its geographical footprint through new boutique openings and omnichannel offerings will likely boost its top line. All considered, higher sales, an improved inventory position, and operational efficiencies will drive its bottom line and bolster its share price.   Stock #2 Investors   could buy  Brookfield Renewable Partners  ( TSX:BEP.UN ) stock for less than $100. This stock will enable investors to capitalize on  energy  transition opportunities. Brookfield Renewable Partners is a pure-play clean energy company that provides investors exposure to the  renewable energy sector , which is likely to deliver enormous growth, driven by rapid adoption of green energy and increased investments to bolster capacity.  Brookfield operates power-generating facilities and provides decarbonization solutions. It owns a well-diversified portfolio of renewable power assets, including wind, solar, and hydroelectric. Brookfield Renewable Partners has almost 34,000 megawatts of renewable power operating capacity and an approximately 157,000-megawatt development pipeline. These attributes position it well to capitalize on growing demand.  It’s worth highlighting that most of Brookfield’s power output (about 90%) is under contractual arrangements. Moreover, 70% of its revenues are indexed to inflation, supporting organic growth. Further, its contracts have a long-weighted average remaining life of 13-plus years, which adds visibility and stability to its cash flows.  The company has been growing its funds from operations (FFO) at a double-digit rate, which enables it to enhance its shareholders’ return through higher dividend payments.  In summary, Brookfield Renewable Partners offers solid growth potential and will likely return cash to its shareholders with higher dividend payouts."},

Up 504% since AI mania kicked off in early 2023, it has outperformed every major stock market index. If you’d invested $10,000 in NVIDIA at the start of the 2023 bull market and held to today, you’d be sitting on a $60,400 position. On top of that, you’d have earned a little bit of dividend income. By now, most North American investors have decided whether they are bullish or bearish on the  “company of the hour.”  The discussion about indirect ways to gain exposure is more interesting. On that topic, there is still some low-hanging fruit. In this article, I will explore my personal favourite  AI stock  in 2024. Taiwan Semiconductor Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  ( NYSE:TSM ) is NVIDIA’s contract manufacturer. It has a piece of NVIDIA’s generative AI action. It also enjoys a solid book of business from  Apple  and chip companies like  AMD, Qualcomm,  and  Broadcomm.  How has TSM acquired such an illustrious book of business? One factor is first-mover advantage: it was the first company ever to think of and implement the business model of exclusively manufacturing chips. Before TSM, companies designed and built their own chips. Later, other companies got into the contract foundry business. However, because they also designed chips, their priorities were divided between fulfilling their own orders and fulfilling client orders. It created a kind of conflict of interest. This fact made TSM the go-to semiconductor foundry, allowing it to lock in contracts from basically all the big chip companies. The only large, pure play foundry As a result of its first-mover advantage and its competitors’ lack of focus, TSM is today the world’s only large pure play foundry.  GlobalFoundries  is somewhat similar – it’s mostly a manufacturer, designing its own products being a small part of its business. However, it’s a relatively small player, doing $7 billion a year in revenue to TSM’s $70.2 billion. It wouldn’t be able to handle the massive orders clients like Apple make. Valuation Despite its innumerable advantages, TSM stock is not especially expensive. Or I should say,  wasn’t  especially expensive when I started buying it. It was at 15 times earnings then; it’s at 28 times earnings now. This doesn’t diminish my enthusiasm for the stock. I sold all my shares at $120 (huge mistake), and later jumped on the opportunity to get back in at $130. I don’t think TSM is at an unreasonable valuation today given its growth prospects. A similar Canadian stock If you’re looking for a Canadian stock similar to TSM, you could consider something like  Kinaxis  ( TSX:KXS ). It’s not  a chip stock , but an AI stock and – let’s be honest – it’s the AI thing more than the chip thing that has investors going crazy for NVIDIA this year. Kinaxis shares one advantage with TSM and NVIDIA: it’s the go-to supplier of an AI-related product. In TSM’s and NVIDIA’s cases it’s AI chips, in KXS’s case it’s AI-powered supply chain management software. According to a manufacturing manager I spoke to, RapidResponse is the industry standard in supply chain management. Further research indicated this manager was correct:  SAP  is its only real competitor, and its reviews are not as good as RapidResponse’s reviews. So, if you’re looking for a Canadian AI stock, KXS is worth researching further."},

These 2 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks Are Trading Near Their 52-Week Lows", "title_link": "https://www.fool.ca/2024/05/13/got-5000-these-2-high-yielding-dividend-stocks-are-trading-near-their-52-week-lows/", "published_date": "May 13, 2024", "publisher_name": "Amy Legate-Wolfe", "Description": "Canadian investors may still be waiting around wondering what to do with their savings. But let me tell you, it certainly isn’t working for you if you’re letting it sit there. Money sitting is money not invested. And money that isn’t invested is money that’s being wasted. But granted, many stocks out there continue to offer lower returns. Which is why today we want to look for high-yielding  dividend  stocks. But before you pick them up, there are a few things to know. What to consider If you’re considering high-yield stocks, investors should consider a few things before diving in. First off, high-yield stocks often come with higher risks. Determine your risk tolerance level before investing, as higher returns typically accompany higher risks. Furthermore, look for companies with a history of stable or growing dividends. Analyze the company’s financial health, cash flow, and payout ratio to ensure the dividends are sustainable in the long term. From there, investors will want to consider the industry the company operates in and the current market trends. Some industries may be more stable than others, while others may be more prone to volatility. Plus, there is also the company’s fundamentals. This would include revenue growth, earnings stability, debt levels, and competitive positioning within its industry. Finally, is the dividend stock even a good value? Assess whether the stock is undervalued, overvalued, or fairly valued based on metrics such as price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), price-to-book ratio (P/B), and dividend yield compared to historical averages and industry peers. This goes for the dividend yield as well. A high dividend yield is attractive, but also consider the potential for future dividend growth. Companies that consistently increase their dividends over time can provide higher total returns. So now, let’s look at two high-yielding dividend stocks that might fit the bill. BCE The first stock that investors may want to consider among high-yielding dividend stocks is  BCE  ( TSX:BCE ). BCE stock is one of Canada’s largest telecommunications companies, providing a comprehensive suite of broadband communication services to residential and business customers across the country. The company offers a stable business model and strong market position, with diverse revenue sources and robust cash flow generation. However, shares have fallen to 52-week lows on earnings. The company stated during its most recent earnings report that BCE stock finally saw some growth after falling from pandemic levels. The stock reported consistent free cash flow generation at $85 million, with strong performance from its key business segments. BCE stock went on to reaffirm all of its 2024 guidance. So while net earnings and adjusted earnings per share are lower, the company still looks stable. And with an 8.63% dividend yield and shares near 52-week lows, it looks like a strong dividend stock to consider researching further. Northland Power Another company that investors can take advantage of near 52-week lows is  Northland Power  ( TSX:NPI ). The  monthly-paying dividend  stock is a Canadian renewable energy company that develops, owns, and operates sustainable power generation assets. Its focus is on renewable energy, providing investors exposure to the growing sector. NPI stock also offers stable and predictable revenue, with a diversified portfolio of renewable energy assets and strong growth prospects. Furthermore, NPI stock has committed to dividend payments, with robust financial performance thanks to the nature of renewable energy assets. This resilient business performance was demonstrated during its most recent fourth-quarter earnings. The dividend stock reported a few growth opportunities, such as offshore wind projects, as well as strong cash flow generation. Management remains optimistic about 2024, despite a decline in net income and sales down compared to the year before. So with shares near 52-week lows and a 5.53% dividend yield, it too looks like a strong dividend stock to consider."},

Some stocks offer excellent returns through capital gains. Others offer returns through shareholder dividends that keep growing your account balance regardless of share price changes. There are also plenty of stocks you can own to enjoy both for several decades. Investing in high-quality stocks can set you up to achieve financial freedom. It begins by creating solid foundations for your self-directed portfolio. Here are two top-notch TSX stocks you should consider adding to your investment portfolio to enjoy growth in the long run. Fortis   Fortis  ( TSX:FTS ) is an excellent long-term holding for many Canadian investors. The $27.47 billion market capitalization business owns and operates several utility businesses across Canada, the U.S., the Caribbean, and Central America. It is among the largest names in the utilities industry in North America. Utility businesses are inherently defensive. Regardless of the economic environment, consumers can never cut utilities to save costs. It allows utility businesses to generate stable and recurring revenues.  Fortis generates almost its entire revenue through assets with long-term contracts in highly rate-regulated markets. It means the company generates predictable cash flows that it can invest comfortably in its capital programs. Fortis stock does not offer plenty of growth in capital gains. However, it offers steadily growing shareholder dividends. A Canadian Dividend Aristocrat, Fortis stock has increased its payouts for over 50 consecutive years. As of this writing, it trades for $55.48 per share, offering payouts at a juicy 4.25% dividend yield. Bank of Montreal Bank of Montreal  ( TSX:BMO ) is one of the Big Six Canadian banks. Each of the Big Six has proven excellent long-term holdings. These banks have a reputation of generating stable revenues, investing in growth, and offering generous dividends to investors. BMO might not be the largest among the Big Six, but it is a solid investment to hold for the long run. Unlike many of its closest peers, BMO generates most of its revenue through its domestic banking operations. In its recent quarter, BMO generated $921 million through its Canadian segment alone, representing over two-thirds of its total revenue. The bank is also expanding its operations abroad, particularly in the United States. The Bank of the West acquisition last year has grown its presence across the border. As a dividend stock, BMO has paid its investors their shareholder dividends for almost two centuries. As of this writing, it trades for $127.56 per share, offering payouts at a juicy 4.74% dividend yield. Foolish takeaway Investing in  top dividend stocks  can help you earn steady passive income for several decades. Besides boosting your cash flows, these high-quality stocks add more stability to your portfolio. The growing earnings base and resilient business models they boast can also deliver significant long-term capital gains. To this end, Fortis stock and Bank of Montreal stock can be excellent holdings for your self-directed investment portfolio."},

Shares of the leading Canadian airline rose from $1.5 in January 2010 to an all-time high of $52 in January 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic decimated airline stocks, including Air Canada, as borders were shut and travel came to a standstill.  Air Canada and its peers were forced to increase balance sheet debt amid plunging sales and negative profit margins to remain operational. While global travel demand has rebounded, the airline sector continues to face headwinds such as inflation, higher interest rates, and elevated fuel prices. Down 64% from all-time highs, Air Canada might be attractive to value investors. Let’s see why. How did Air Canada stock perform in Q1 of 2024? Air Canada reported operating revenues of $5.2 billion in the first quarter (Q1) of 2024, up $339 million year over year. Its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) stood at $453 million, up $42 million from the year-ago period. It generated a free cash flow of $1 billion in Q1 and ended the quarter with a net-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 0.9 times. Its cash flow was used to deleverage the balance sheet by reducing gross debt, resulting in a rating upgrade from S&P Global Rating, a reputed credit agency. A key ratio for airline stocks is the cost per available seat mile (CASM), which determines a company’s operational efficiency. The CASM ratio measures the operating cost of each seat mile flown and is calculated by dividing operating costs by available seat miles. Due to higher labour, maintenance, and technology expenses, Air Canada’s adjusted CASM rose 1.6% to 14.76 cents in Q1 of 2023. What’s next for Air Canada stock? Air Canada expects to increase capacity between 6% and 8% year over year in 2024. It is also forecast to end the year with EBITDA between $3.7 billion and $4.2 billion. The company ended 2023 with a net debt of $3.78 billion, which might seem significant. However, its net debt has reduced by roughly $3.8 billion in the last four quarters. With $10 billion in total liquidity, Air Canada has enough flexibility to navigate an uncertain macro environment and reinvest in growth projects. The airline giant is forecast to spend $2.1 billion in capital expenditures this year and has allocated $12.8 billion towards capital projects between 2025 and 2028. Air Canada plans to purchase around 80 aircraft in the next five years to modernize its fleet, which should also boost future cash flows. Analysts tracking Air Canada stock expect its earnings per share to decline from $4.56 in 2023 to $3.55 in 2024. So, priced at 5.3 times  forward earnings , Air Canada stock is quite cheap and should expand its earnings once interest rates move lower and inflation is brought under control. Bay Street remains bullish on Air Canada stock. Out of the 16 analysts tracking AC stock, 13 recommend “buy” and three recommend “hold.” The average target price for Air Canada stock is $27.56, suggesting an upside potential of over 50% from current levels."},

But that’s a lot of money to invest. So if you’re like me, you don’t exactly want to throw $10,000 into the first  growth stock  that comes across your screen. Instead, use that $10,000 to create a solid foundation for your portfolio. Luckily, options exist that can fit within every type of risk tolerance, and every type of goal. Even better, there’s one  exchange-traded fund  (ETF) that I would recommend for those seeking long-term growth, while still earning dividends. VXC ETF For Canadians looking to invest in something that provides you with growth and income, I would consider the  Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap ex Canada Index ETF  ( TSX:VXC ). VXC aims to closely track the performance of the FTSE Global All Cap ex Canada Index. This index includes thousands of stocks from both developed and emerging markets around the world, providing investors with broad exposure to international equities. So really, it’s like getting a diversified, global portfolio with the click of a button.  By investing in VXC, investors gain exposure to companies across various regions, including the United States, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and emerging markets. This diversification can help reduce risk by spreading investments across different geographical areas and industries. Furthermore, the index is weighted by market capitalization, meaning that larger companies make up a larger portion of the index. This approach aligns with the philosophy of many passive investment strategies, which seek to replicate the composition of the broader market. Growth and dividends Over time, VXC has seen a lot of growth and provided a ton in dividends. All while offering a low-cost approach considering it merely tracks the performance of an index. As of writing, investors can grab onto a dividend yield at 1.58%. Furthermore, shares have grown 11% year to date already. This growth has been even higher over the last few years. While other companies, countries, and stocks have seen shares fall never to return to pandemic highs, VXC ETF has taken off. In the last decade alone, shares of VXC have climbed 128%! That’s a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.6% during the last 10 years. Add on the company’s quarterly dividend, and investors can certainly look forward to earning quite a lot in the next few years. How much? Let’s say that you put that $10,000 into VXC today. You then see shares continue to climb by the same CAGR as it has in the past. Remember, it’s actually grown quite a lot more than that in the last year. So you could be met with even more growth. Furthermore, you’ll add an additional cash flow stream from the company’s dividends. The dividend can change depending on the underlying holdings of the ETF. But for now, we’ll go with the current dividend of $0.14 per share. In that case, here is how much you could earn in the next year. COMPANY RECENT PRICE NUMBER OF SHARES DIVIDEND TOTAL PAYOUT FREQUENCY PORTFOLIO TOTAL VXC – now $57.55 174 $0.14 $24.36 quarterly $10,000 VXC – 8.6% $62.50 174 $0.14 $24.36 quarterly $10,875 By the end of next year, you could easily have returns of $875 and dividends of $24.37. This would total $899.36 in passive income. Yet again, given the history of the ETF, I would expect that to increase even more."},

Since you don’t have to pay any tax on the investment income, the TFSA is an ideal account to invest in  high-growth  and high-yield stocks that have the potential to make you a millionaire in the long term.  Four stocks every Canadian should have in a TFSA Consider building a  diversified TFSA portfolio  across different asset classes, sectors, and stock types to ensure multiple sources of income and profits. Each asset class, sector, and stock has a different return potential. They react differently to a situation, giving you the best of all scenarios. Here, I have identified four stocks across asset classes and sectors you should consider having in your TFSA. However, the allocation of funds can differ as per your risk appetite.  Shopify stock Shopify  ( TSX:SHOP ) is a must-have tech stock in your TFSA as it has a moat in the e-commerce space. The company has overcome the volatility caused by the pandemic and is now on a normal growth trajectory. However, it has some degree of seasonality to it. The stock tends to do well in the holiday season when consumers spend on discretionary items. And it tends to fall in the first quarter when sales are the lowest.  Shopify has been steadily growing its subscribers and gross merchandise volume. However, its business has not yet reached the level of stable profits. So you can expect the stock price to remain volatile in the short term. You can use this volatility to buy the stock at a dip. For instance, Shopify stock fell 23% last week to around $80 after it reported weak second-quarter  guidance . The stock has dropped to the lower end of the seasonal range, making it a buy-and-hold for the long term.  This stock will grow along with the economy and has the potential to generate wealth in the long term, riding the e-commerce wave.  Hive Digital Technologies stock  Hive Digital Technologies  ( TSXV:HIVE ) is a highly volatile stock and should only be bought at the dip. The company has high-performance data centres, which it uses for Bitcoin mining. However, it is aware that the margins from mining are slipping, and it needs to diversify. Hence, it is offering its data centre space for artificial intelligence (AI) computing. The revenue from AI computing can help it produce stable cash flow and normalize the volatility from Bitcoin.  Hive can give your TFSA portfolio exposure to the  crypto asset class . Note that you are not allowed to invest in crypto directly through your TFSA. However, since Hive is not a cryptocurrency but a business, you can benefit from the next crypto bubble. This stock will grow in a strong economy. Now is a good time to buy this stock as it has fallen 20% below its lower range price of $4. You could consider selling the stock when it reaches $7 to $8 for short-term growth or holding it for the long term.  Hive will give you exposure to alternate asset classes as well as the secular AI trend.  Barrick Gold  One should have some exposure to  gold  as an asset class to hedge a portfolio in a crisis.  Barrick Gold  ( TSX:ABX ) is one of the largest gold mining companies. The gold miner has reduced its debt significantly and can give you exposure to gold price volatility. Barrick Gold may not give you long-term capital appreciation as the above two stocks, but it will protect your portfolio from a severe downside. Gold prices tend to go up when the dollar value falls or inflation rises.  Never buy this stock at its peak since there is no long-term growth. You could consider buying the stock when it falls below $20. ABX might underperform in a strong economy and outperform in a weak economy. In either case, you can enjoy a 2-3% annual dividend yield.  Enbridge  Apart from the above shares, consider adding a dividend aristocrat like Enbridge to have some assurance of a regular payout even in a crisis. You can use the dividend money to add to the above stocks."},

One is a popular store that can be found in cities across North America, and the other is a vendor of exercise equipment with attached tablets. Both companies have loyal customers as well as detractors. The question for investors is, which is the better buy? The case for Lululemon The case for buying Lululemon over Peloton rests on the fact that it is easily the more profitable and faster growing of the two companies. In the trailing 12-month period, LULU delivered the following:   18.6% revenue growth   82% diluted earnings per share (EPS) growth   68% free cash flow growth   A 58% gross margin   A 16% net margin   A 42% return on equity (ROE)   Here are comparable figures for PTON in the trailing 12-month period:   -4.85% revenue growth   -8% free cash flow growth   A 40% gross margin   A -28% net margin   A non-meaningful return on equity   The rest of the figures I provided for LULU were non-meaningful for PTON in the TTM period due to them having been negative in the base period   The basic problem with Peloton, like many other companies, is that it was a “COVID-19 winner” in the early months of the pandemic. When gyms shut down, many people flocked to exercise equipment companies to get their much-needed gym supplies. Eventually, the COVID-19 restrictions, including gym shutdowns, ended. The result of that was that people no longer needed Peloton exercise bikes as much as they used to.  Also, established players like NordicTrack quickly copied Peloton’s gimmick of including a tablet with the bike. The result of the pandemic safety measures winding down and competitors catching up was Peloton’s sales declining. The case for Peloton Peloton is not doing well as a company by any stretch of the imagination. However, it does arguably have one factor going for it: valuation. Lululemon is pretty pricey. At today’s prices, it trades at the following:   27 times earnings   4.65 times sales   10.5 times book value   19.35 times operating cash flow   26.9 times free cash flow   It’s not cheap. By contrast, PTON trades at 0.5 times sales, which is  extremely  cheap . However, there are no price/earnings, price/book or price/free cash flow  ratios  for PTON, because that company is deeply unprofitable. So, comparing it to Lululemon is an “apples-to-oranges” comparison. Final verdict: LULU stock by a mile Taking everything into account, Lululemon appears to be a better buy than Peloton. It’s growing faster, it has higher margins, its brand is more differentiated, and the list just goes on and on. True, Peloton does have a lower price/sales ratio than Lulu does, but the persistent lack of profitability raises the question of whether PTON is simply structurally incapable of being profitable. Maybe it just faces too much competition from stronger players. If that’s the case, then the low price/sales ratio means nothing because said sales will never translate to profit. Therefore, Lululemon looks like a better buy than Peloton today."},

These are the characteristic strengths of the Big Six Canadian bank stocks. So, if you want to buy into a Canadian bank for these two reasons, any of the Big Six might suffice, but if you are looking for a healthy growth and dividend combination, the choices would be a bit more limited. From a growth perspective, there is one bank stock you may consider buying hand over fist and one you should avoid. The bank stock to buy National Bank of Canada  ( TSX:NA ) is one of the best Canadian bank stocks you can buy for growth and has been doing this for years. It has returned about 284% to its investors in the last 10 years, and most of these returns are rooted in its growth, not dividends. The collective return number is the highest among the Big Six by a considerable margin. It also reacts both positively and swiftly to trends in the sector. Right now, the financial industry in Canada is going up as a whole, and the index has risen by over 3.8% in the last 30 days alone. National Bank of Canada has embraced this spirit; it has gone up 4.8% over the same period and has experienced over 15% growth since the beginning of this year. So, if growth is something you prioritize or something you want to add to your portfolio, National Bank is the stock you want to buy from the banking sector. That doesn’t mean it’s not worth buying for dividends. It’s an Aristocrat with a solid payout ratio and dividend-growth history and is offering dividends at a current yield of about 3.65%. This makes it a decent buy for dividends and a good pick for growth. The bank stock to avoid It’s worth noting that  Toronto-Dominion  ( TSX:TD ) is not a weak stock per se, but if you want to buy Canadian bank stock, then its  bear market  phase makes it an unsuitable pick. Since the beginning of 2024, the bank has actually slumped 9.7%, which is in stark contrast to the National Bank’s growth over this period. The slump has yet to lead to the bank being better valued, and the price to earnings of Toronto-Dominion is on the higher side within the banking sector. The dividend yield is quite attractive at 5.2%, so if you want to buy it for dividends, it’s still a valid pick, but if you want a healthy combination of growth and dividends, then it may be best to avoid this bank stock. Foolish takeaway It’s important to understand that while the two stocks are currently on different ends of growth potential within the banking sector, that’s not always the case. While the National Bank of Canada is almost always an excellent pick for growth, Toronto-Dominion is also a valid pick (typically). However, its performance in 2024 has not kept up with that trend."},
{"source_name": "The Motley Fool", "title": "Best Stocks to Buy in May 2024: TSX Utilities Sector", "title_link": "https://www.fool.ca/2024/05/13/best-stocks-to-buy-in-may-2024-tsx-utilities-sector/", "published_date": "May 13, 2024", "publisher_name": "Andrew Button", "Description": "Utilities sector stocks are among the biggest Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) components. Over the years, some utilities have outperformed the TSX year after year, while paying high dividend income. They have provided satisfactory returns with low volatility. However, there is more to this story than it appears at first glance. Although some well-known utilities have outperformed the TSX, the sector as a whole hasn’t done that well. The  TSX Index  is up 37% over five years, while the  S&P/TSX Capped Utilities Sub-Index  is only up 12.3%. Although the TSX utilities index has a high average yield (4.15%), the TSX index overall has a fairly respectable 2.8% yield. That 1.35% yield differential appears unlikely to make up for utilities’ poor price return, which is about one-third that of the index. Nevertheless, these outperforming  individual utilities  do exist. What’s more, they’ve been pretty consistently the same companies over time. In this article, I will explore two TSX utilities that may be worth buying in May 2024. Fortis Fortis Inc  ( TSX:FTS ) is a TSX utilities stock and a “dividend king.” A dividend king is a company that has raised its dividend for 50 consecutive years. Fortis acquired the distinction last year. Fortis has been on an impressive run over the last 10 years. Its stock price has risen 72% in that period while it paid a 4% dividend yield on average. The yield today is 4.2%. If the company can keep up its dividend growth track record, then it will have a higher yield-on-cost in the future. Can  Fortis keep up its dividend growth track record? It’s hard to say with certainty, but the company’s financial trends appear to be similar to those observed in the past. The dividend payout ratio is around 70%, and the debt-equity ratio (1.47) is slightly lower than it was 10 years ago (1.64). However, because interest rates are relatively high right now, Fortis’ debt is incurring much more interest as a percentage of revenue than it did 10 years ago. If rates come down, then I’d expect Fortis stock to really fly. Otherwise, it pays a stable dividend that probably isn’t going anywhere. Brookfield Renewables Brookfield Renewable Corporation  ( TSX:BEPC ) is a Canadian  renewable energy  company that, among other things, operates as a utility. It recently signed a massive agreement to supply  Microsoft  with 10.5 gigawatts of power. I estimated in a past article that that could bring in $1.4 billion in revenue for Brookfield Renewable. Based on energy prices I found online, I still think that estimate is about right. Apart from the Microsoft deal, Brookfield Renewable owns a variety of utility operations in the Caribbean and Latin America. The company’s hydroelectric and wind projects are profitable, although it’s still losing money on solar. Brookfield Renewable has grown considerably over the last eight years, having tripled its revenue in that period, and transformed its earnings from a small loss to a $1.8 billion profit. On the whole, this is one renewable power company with a lot of exciting things going on. It’s worth mentioning that “Brookfield Renewable” is also offered in the form of a fund,  Brookfield Renewable Partners . The fund owns a similar asset portfolio as the company, but has a different structure. Notably, BEPC is eligible for the dividend tax credit in Canada."},

The company reported its first quarter that beat out earnings estimates, leading to a jump in the share price of 8%. However, Canadian Tire stock also warned that consumer demand was softening, leading to a decrease in revenue and sales. So, now, with shares up but the future uncertain, here’s what investors need to know after earnings. The earnings For its first-quarter earnings, Canadian Tire reported a significant increase in net income attributable to shareholders compared to the previous year. Despite the decline in revenue, the substantial growth in profit from $7.8 million to $76.8 million indicates effective cost management and operational efficiency. Furthermore, its normalized diluted  earnings per share  (EPS) increased by $0.38, reflecting improved profitability on a per-share basis. This growth in EPS might have positively influenced investor sentiment and contributed to the stock price increase. And although  retail revenue  decreased, there were positive indicators within the retail segment. Despite a decline in sales, retail IBT (income before taxes) improved significantly, indicating better profitability despite challenging market conditions. Additionally, the retail gross margin rate increased, demonstrating better management of costs and pricing strategies. Inventory improvement Part of the reason there was softer demand came from store dealers pulling back on inventory. This especially came from non-essential items. And it’s why the company believes there was such a large gap between sales and revenue during this first quarter. However, this is improving, especially as we approach summer. The company mentioned that dealers continued to manage inventory health by drawing it down. While this might have led to a gap between sales and revenue in the first quarter, it indicates a prudent approach to inventory management, which can lead to reduced costs associated with excess inventory and improved cash flow. Investors may have viewed this as a positive sign of operational efficiency. And while there might be problems with non-essentials, essentials and seasonal categories were performing well, particularly in auto services. This resilience in essential categories amidst softer demand for discretionary items could indicate stable revenue streams and better performance compared to non-essential categories.  Future optimism While other companies have been warning about the future, Canadian Tire stock has remained positive. The current economic slowdown has been hard on the company, and challenges continue. However, Canadian Tire’s strategic initiatives to focus on essentials, create value for customers, and adjust inventory management based on consumption patterns could signal resilience and adaptability to changing market conditions. Market analysts and investors have reacted positively to Canadian Tire stock’s commentary on potential interest rate cuts by the Bank of Canada, which could foster economic stability and ease uncertainties in business operations. Additionally, the company’s focus on essential categories and value creation for customers through promotions might have been perceived as proactive measures to navigate through economic challenges. Bottom line Canadian Tire stock still has work to do but is now in a more positive light about the future. And that’s more than can be said for other retail stocks. So, with shares improving yet still down 13% in the last year and with a 4.81% dividend yield, which is higher than its 3.41% average of the last five years, it looks like a strong buy on the TSX today."},

On the flip side,  BlackBerry ,  Ballard Power Systems , and  Methanex  surged by at least 4.6% each, making them the session’s top-performing TSX stocks.

Despite a seasonally slow quarter, Premium Brands’s revenue  rose  2.2% year over year to $1.5 billion in the first three months of 2024. Although higher wage inflation and investments in additional plant infrastructure affected its profitability, the company’s adjusted quarterly earnings of $0.54 per share still exceeded Street analysts’ estimates due mainly to solid growth in its U.S. specialty foods segment.

Despite this, I think that a focus on stable,  defensive stocks  would be advisable. This leads me to  Enbridge Inc . ( TSX:ENB ). Over the past five years ago, Enbridge’s stock price has been flat, but the fundamentals have kept improving. Is it a buy in 2024? Enbridge: Consistency, growth, and reliability The very nature of Enbridge’s business is one that generates steady and predictable cash flows. This can be seen in Enbridge’s results, both in the long term and short term. In fact, since 2019, Enbridge’s net income has increased almost 10% to $5.8 billion and its cash flow from operations has increased 50% to $14 billion. Let’s turn now to dividends, which are well supported by Enbridge’s low-risk, predictable cash flow. Enbridge’s dividend has grown annually since 2004. Also, since 2004, Enbridge’s stock price, alongside its dividend, has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12%. Looking ahead, I expect that this strong performance will continue in 2024 and beyond. Here are my reasons. Natural gas demand remains high In the grand scheme of things,  natural gas remains essential  to power our homes and our businesses. This has not, and will not change, even as we attempt to lower carbon emissions. Because as a relatively cleaner fuel, natural gas plays an important part in emissions reductions.   Furthermore, there are two new and emerging sources of natural gas demand. The first is liquified natural gas, or LNG, demand. LNG has made it possible to export our natural gas abroad, and demand from places like Asia is high. The global push to reduce emissions has resulted in strong demand for North America’s natural gas, as coal plants continue to close and natural gas is replacing them. Finally, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to create another source of demand for energy. Natural gas demand is expected to be boosted significantly, as AI data centres emerge. It’s estimated that this could increase electricity demand by as much as 20% by 2030. Natural gas is expected to supply 60% of power demand growth from AI and data centres. Enbridge is well-positioned in both growth areas With a growing connection to the U.S. Gulf Coast, Enbridge is increasingly participating in the LNG industry. In its latest quarter, Enbridge acquired two docks in the U.S. Gulf Coast. This will optimize the company’s operations in the area and will help Enbridge’s Ingleside facility to become an industry-leading export terminal. Also, in Enbridge’s latest quarter, the company closed its acquisition of East Ohio Gas. This acquisition of this utility gives Enbridge increased exposure to the increased demand that is expected in the next few years. It also further diversifies Enbridge’s business, extends its growth outlook, and enhances the stable cash flow profile of its asset base. Attractive valuation At this time, Enbridge stock is trading at roughly 17 times earnings. Also, it trades at a dividend yield of 7.3%. I view the company’s dividend as well-covered, predictable, and reliable. I think Enbridge stock is definitely a great buy in 2024."},

I’ve been holding the stock since the 2022 tech bear market, and I plan on staying put. Although the stock is fairly richly valued now, it is not so expensive that it is an obvious sell. I sold my  Apple  shares when that company was at 30 times earnings and not growing. Google is at 26 times earnings and still growing at a rapid pace – I think I’ll stay put. The latest big news from Google was the company’s fresh new dividend. At $0.20 per share, it yields just 0.12%. Nevertheless, the mere fact of a dividend was greeted with applause from long-time shareholders when it was announced. Still, I don’t see Google as the most attractive place to deploy capital into today. It is the highest-quality business I know of, but it is expensive enough that I don’t really feel like running out and buying more. There is a stock I know of that’s cheap enough to be worth investing fresh money in today. In this article, I will explore that stock and explain why I’ve been actively buying shares this month. TD Bank For investors with a high-risk tolerance and long time horizons, the  Toronto-Dominion Bank  ( TSX:TD ) may be a better place to deploy fresh capital into today than Google. This stock isn’t for everyone – it has an active U.S. Department of Justice Investigation into its money laundering controls, and has already booked $450 million in fines. But it is fairly cheap, and pays a nice 5.3% dividend that is well covered by earnings. Its business is not as high quality as Google’s, but factoring valuation into the picture, it might be a better overall buy. Dirt cheap Because of the incredibly highly publicized money laundering investigation it is under, TD has gotten dirt cheap. At today’s prices, it trades at 10 times earnings and 1.3 times book value. That’s much cheaper than the average S&P 500 stock, and even cheaper than the average bank stock. Large  North American banks  are trading at around 12.5 times earnings today on average. Previously, they were valued similarly to TD, but they started rallying when first-quarter earnings showed major growth in their investment banking (IB) segments. Because it is being investigated by the DoJ, and will likely pay $2 billion in fines, TD has gotten much cheaper than the average bank. However, if the $2 billion in fines are all booked in one year, that’s only a year’s earnings that’s reduced by 20%. In the context of TD’s overall financial picture, it’s not all that much. Solid revenue growth Another thing worth noting about TD is that, although the fines are likely to cause negative earnings growth in the coming 12 months, the company’s revenue growth is still strong. It recently bought the U.S. investment bank Cowen, and IB has been hot lately, so that should make a positive contribution to revenue in the year ahead. Lastly, the concern that TD can’t grow in the U.S. anymore because of the investigation is overblown. TD probably isn’t getting approved to buy U.S. retail banks anytime soon, but it got its Cowen deal approved swiftly, while the DoJ investigation was ongoing. So, it can still expand in the U.S. through non-retail banking acquisitions. Finally, TD’s 5.3%-yielding  dividend  can still be paid even with a $2 billion fine taken out of earnings. On the whole, it’s an intriguing buy for risk-tolerant investors."},

But the headwinds haven’t proven insurmountable, with various bank stocks like  Royal Bank of Canada  ( TSX:RY ) finding a way to climb higher despite downbeat macro expectations. Undoubtedly, Canada’s economy doesn’t seem to be headed for a harsh recession.  At the same time, it doesn’t seem to be a loud roaring economy, either, as the TSX Index just begins to pick up traction in what could be the first innings of the new bull market. With the TSX Index just north of 22% from its lows, it does seem like the bull is back in the driver’s seat.  Don’t expect a June rate cut — not after the jobs data That said, there seems to be an aura of uncertainty that could prevent  investors  from piling back into the bull trade. Indeed, the Bank of Canada (BoC) may cut interest rates sooner than the U.S. Federal Reserve, but that doesn’t mean a June rate cut is on the table.  Arguably, the recent jobs data has pushed out such a rate cut, I believe, to the late third or even fourth quarter of 2024. And if inflation proves just a bit too sticky, I would not be surprised if we escape 2024 without a single rate cut from the Bank of Canada, especially if the economy isn’t yet ready to pick up some serious traction.  With a bit of inflation at risk of sticking around for a while longer, pressure from past price increases (remember, just because inflation normalizes doesn’t mean the higher prices suddenly go away), and potentially flat growth for the economy, I’d argue the BoC has plenty of reasons to postpone the first round of rate cuts. Indeed, there may be less to lose if they choose to cut next year rather than running the risk of pulling back on rates too soon and giving inflation a chance to worsen. Royal Bank stock: It’s been hot of late! Now, back to Royal Bank of Canada: it’s proven an incredibly resilient financial over the past year, with shares now up close to 9% year to date and around 32% from its October 2023 lows.  The stock trades at 13.3 times trailing price to earnings (P/E), with a dividend yield that currently stands just shy of the 4% mark at 3.91%. Indeed, shares of RY remain attractively  valued , but they’re not the same steal that they were two quarters ago. In any case, as RY stock leads the Canadian banking group higher, I’d not be afraid to be a net buyer if the dividend entices you.  I’m very enthused about Royal Bank’s acquisition of HSBC’s Canadian division, and I think it could give the $202 billion banking giant a slight edge over its rivals in the so-called Big Six. While I don’t think it’s too late to be a net buyer of RY stock, I think there’s more value to be had in one of its more pressured rivals. Indeed, some banks are close to multi-year lows, with dividend yields that are well above the 5% mark.  Bottom line: It’s not too late to buy RY stock So, if you seek deeper value and fatter yields, it may be best to look elsewhere. However, if you seek rock-solid stability for the long run and aren’t afraid to pay a fair (rather than dirt-cheap) multiple, go ahead and pick up RY. It’s not too late to hop aboard the name. But I’d much rather wait for a pullback to around $130 before getting in."},

Investors who missed the recent bounce and are wondering which top TSX dividend stocks are still  undervalued  today and might be good to buy for their self-directed Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) and Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) accounts. TC Energy TC Energy  ( TSX:TRP ) is up about 6% in the past month but still trades below $53 compared to more than $73 at the high point in 2022 before the Bank of Canada and the U.S. Federal Reserve aggressively raised interest rates. Pipeline companies grow through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth projects. Debt plays a role in the financing of the growth initiatives, so a steep rise in borrowing charges can put pressure on projects that cost billions of dollars to build and often take years to complete. A jump in debt expenses puts pressure on profits and can reduce cash available for distributions.  Interest rates are expected to decline in the second half of 2024 or in 2025. This should attract investors back to the pipeline sector.  TC Energy’s 670 km Coastal GasLink project reached mechanical completion last year. The final cost is expected to be around $14.5 billion, which is more than double the initial budget. TC Energy’s overall business, however, performed well in 2023, and management expects ongoing capital investments to support planned annual dividend increases of at least 3%. The board has increased the payout annually for more than two decades. TC Energy’s extensive natural gas transmission network and gas storage capacity in Canada, the United States, and Mexico put the company in a good position to benefit from an anticipated surge in demand for natural gas in the coming years as power-hungry data centres are built to support artificial intelligence. A large chunk of the electricity they use will likely be produced by gas-fired power plants, along with renewable sources. At the time of writing, TRP stock provides a 7.3% dividend yield. Telus Telus  ( TSX:T ) generated growth in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of 7.6% in 2023. That’s pretty good, considering the management team had to reduce guidance last summer due to revenue challenges faced by the  Telus International  subsidiary. Revenue pressures in that group are expected to continue through most of 2024, but management anticipates an improvement in demand by the end of the year. In 2024, Telus is targeting adjusted EBITDA growth of 5.5% to 7.5%. Free cash flow is expected to improve, and the dividend should continue to grow. Telus reduced staff by roughly 6,000 positions last year. The impact of the lower expenses should show up in the 2024 results. Price wars and an uncertain regulatory environment could be an overhang for the stock over the medium term. That being said, investors who buy Telus stock at the current level can collect a decent 7% dividend yield while they wait for the rebound. The bottom line on top TSX dividend stocks TC Energy and Telus pay attractive dividends that should continue to grow. If you have cash to put to work, these stocks deserve to be on your radar."},

Moreover, dividend stocks typically provide a significant degree of reliability and safety. To start paying dividends, companies must have a considerable track record of profitability or at least a strong expectation of consistent returns in the years ahead. However, not every dividend stock is reliable or worth an investment. When adding dividend stocks to your portfolio, selecting companies that offer a solid mix of reliability and growth potential is crucial. Without reliability, these stocks could face challenges that impact their profitability and force them to cut dividends. Such a scenario would be disastrous for two reasons. It would reduce the passive income you receive from that investment and it would also significantly decrease the value of your investment. On the other hand, without significant growth potential, you might earn the same dividend or return for years, which  inflation  will erode over time. And even if a stock does offer growth potential, if it grows slower than inflation, you’re still technically earning a smaller and smaller return over the  long term . Therefore, if you’re seeking high-quality dividend stocks to buy now and hold for years, it’s essential to choose stocks that are both reliable and defensive but also possess significant growth potential, stocks such as  CT REIT  ( TSX:CRT.UN ),  Parkland  ( TSX:PKI ) and  Canadian Utilities  ( TSX:CU ), all of which are on the Canadian dividend aristocrats list. Real estate is an excellent industry for finding high-quality dividend stocks When looking for unstoppable dividend stocks that can pay you for life, essentially every industry will have at least a few. That said, one of the best industries to look in first, with several high-quality dividend stocks, is the real estate sector, where one of the very best is CT REIT. CT REIT is a retail REIT whose majority owner and largest tenant is  Canadian Tire , accounting for roughly 90% of its revenue. This relationship is key for CT REIT, especially since Canadian Tire is one of Canada’s largest and best-known retailers. It gives CT REIT high reliability, especially as a retail REIT in an environment where e-commerce continues to disrupt typical retail operations, pressuring landlords across the country. Therefore, it’s considerably noticeable that since going public, CT REIT has never had a year in which it didn’t increase its sales or dividends, including through the pandemic when many retail REITs were significantly impacted. Today, with the dividend stock trading off its high, it offers investors a yield of roughly 6.5%. Therefore, if you’re looking for a high-quality stock that could generate significant passive income for life, CT REIT is one you’ll definitely want to consider. Energy and utility stocks offer a tonne of resiliency In addition to real estate, energy and utility stocks are also businesses with essential operations and consistent cash flow, creating several unstoppable dividend stocks. For example, Canadian Utilities is one of the most defensive stocks on the market, with highly essential and government-regulated utility assets that offer predictable revenue streams. Furthermore, it also has highly diversified operations, owning energy storage and electricity generating assets. Therefore, it’s unsurprising that Canadian Utilities has the longest dividend growth streak in Canada, at 51 consecutive years. So, with Canadian Utilities trading cheaply, offering a yield of more than 5.6%, a track record of continuous dividend growth and a highly manageable  payout ratio  of just 77%, it’s certainly one of the top dividend stocks Canadian investors can buy. As a fuel refiner, distributor and owner of gas stations and convenience stores, Parkland is similar in many ways to Canadian Utilities. Its operations may not be as safe as a utility stock, but because they are essential, the stock can consistently generate significant cash flow. Furthermore, while it may be less defensive, the tradeoff is that it offers more growth potential. Not to mention, Parkland is well diversified, too, thanks to its vertically integrated operations. Therefore, although it offers a lower yield than Canadian Utilities, at just 3.5%, it has the potential for more significant capital gains over the long haul. So, if you’re looking for a high-quality dividend stock to buy today, Parkland is certainly one to keep on your watchlist."},

Additionally, moderating inflation and anticipated rate cuts are expected to further boost equity markets in 2024 and beyond. If you plan to invest $50,000 or even less in equity, it’s wise to choose a diversified basket of stocks with  strong fundamentals  and solid growth prospects. This approach helps reduce risk and gain exposure to high-growth sectors with secular tailwinds.  With this backdrop, here are the five best  Canadian stocks  to buy now with $50,000. goeasy goeasy  ( TSX:GSY ) stock is a must-have in your portfolio to create enduring wealth. Its ability to consistently grow its revenue and earnings at a high double-digit rate and commitment towards enhancing shareholders’ value through higher dividend payments acts as a catalyst.  The company benefits from its leadership in the Canadian subprime lending market and a large TAM (total addressable market). Furthermore, goeasy’s omnichannel offerings, geographical expansion, diversified funding base, and solid underwriting capabilities position it well to generate stellar earnings in the coming years, which will likely boost its share price and future dividend payments.  Brookfield Renewable Partners Adding a few  renewable energy stocks  to your portfolio is a wise move, given the sector’s strong growth prospects and increasing adoption of clean energy.  Brookfield Renewable Partners  ( TSX:BEP.UN ) stands out as a top stock in this sector, poised to capitalize on energy transition opportunities. Its highly diversified asset base and significant installed capacity position it well to benefit from the rising demand for green energy. Moreover, its highly contracted portfolio and inflation-indexed revenue provide visibility and stability to its cash flows. The company’s 34,000 megawatts of operating renewable power capacity and approximately 157,000-megawatt development pipeline position it well to grow its funds from operations (FFO) at a double-digit rate. The expansion of FFO will likely bolster its share price and enable the company to offer higher dividend payments.  Constellation Software  Investors should add a few tech stocks to their portfolio to significantly enhance overall returns in the long term.  Constellation Software  ( TSX:CSU ) is one such high-quality  Canadian tech stock  to consider. Thanks to its diversified portfolio and ability to offer tailored solutions, Constellation Software remains well-positioned to capitalize on evolving technology and demand trends.  Constellation Software will also likely benefit from its broad portfolio of software businesses and large customer base. Its strategy of consistently acquiring and integrating small- to mid-sized vertical market software (VMS) companies will further drive its financials and bolster CSU stock in the long term.  Shopify Within the tech space, one could also consider adding  Shopify  ( TSX:SHOP ) stock. This leading e-commerce company is well-positioned to capitalize on the shift in selling models towards omnichannel platforms. This would enable Shopify to deliver durable revenue growth and generate significant returns in the long term. Shopify’s discounted share price supports the bull case, which presents a good buying opportunity near the current levels.  The company’s ability to grow its gross merchandise volumes will likely drive its top line. Moreover, its strategic pivot towards an asset-light business model augurs well for long-term growth. Additionally, Shopify’s focus on improving its take rate, launching new products, integrating artificial intelligence (AI) technology into its products, and prioritizing profitable growth bodes well for its prospects.  Dollarama  Last but not least, investors could add a few high-quality defensive stocks to their portfolios for stability and growth.  Dollarama  ( TSX:DOL ) stands out as the top stock offering growth, income, and stability. This discount retailer consistently generates solid revenue and earnings regardless of economic cycles. Further, Dollarama also enhances its shareholders’ value through uninterrupted dividend payments.  Dollarama’s value pricing strategy could continue to drive traffic and sales in the future. Moreover, product expansion, an extensive and growing store base, and a direct sourcing strategy will likely support the company’s financials and share price."},

This telecom stock fell almost 39% to its 10-year low of $44, making even long-term investors wonder how low it could go. The stock saw a recovery of over 5% in the last 30 days. Does it mean the stock has bottomed out? While it is difficult to say if this rally is a recovery or just a temporary jump before another dip, it is a sign to load up on BCE stock.  Why has BCE stock been on a downtrend?  BCE stock has been falling for three reasons:   Rising interest rates have made its debt expensive, putting pressure on its free cash flow (FCF). Thus, its dividend payout ratio was 113% of FCF in 2023.    The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) released a wholesale mandate in November 2023, asking BCE and  Telus  to provide competitors access to their network at wholesale rates. While the telcos oppose this mandate, it has made investors bearish as it could impact the long-term cash flows of telcos and pause or slow dividend growth.    BCE has been in the news for significant job cuts as it restructures its business. The company is shutting down several radio stations and electronics stores.    Why am I bullish on BCE stock?  While the above three factors are affecting BCE’s net income and FCF, its long-term secular trend of  5G remains  intact. BCE is expanding its exposure to cloud services and digital ads. These segments could flourish as the 5G adoption leads to the Internet of Things (IoT) proliferation. Multiple devices, from cars to cameras to drones to robots, will be connected to the cloud, creating more avenues for generating cash flows.  Moreover, the interest rates will eventually decline as such high rates could hurt economic growth. BCE could restructure its debt and improve its credit ratings when interest rate cuts begin. In March, S&P Global  downgraded  BCE’s outlook from stable to negative due to elevated debt ratios of 3.5 times and rising competition.  As for the regulatory risk, BCE and Telus are working with the CRTC to find a middle ground that encourages competition without affecting  returns on  network investment. Large carriers spend billions of dollars on building network infrastructure to provide connectivity to the vast geography of Canada.  In a February discussion, BCE and Telus  proposed some  conditions to the wholesale mandate.    BCE proposed that it will give competitors access to speeds of only up to 1.5Gbps and fibre-to-the-premises only after five years of deploying the network in that area. This delay would help reduce the negative impact on investment returns.   Telus proposed that the wholesale mandate should not apply in rural and remote areas, high-cost buried fibre areas, and areas where they serve.   While the above measures do not promote competition, they open a discussion to work on a settlement. Should you load up on telecom shares?  After analyzing the negatives and positives of the telecom sector, the short-term headwinds are still persistent and could pull down the stocks after a short rally. However, long-term secular trends from the 5G opportunity indicate that BCE will continue to pay the current dividend per share for another decade. Maybe it might pause its dividend growth for the next three to four years till it builds out new cash flow streams from its telco to techno restructuring (cloud, digitization, and more).  A 10-year low stock price is a once-in-a-decade opportunity to lock in an annual yield above 8%. If you keep loading up your BCE shares throughout the downtrend, you could reduce the average cost per share. Once the regulatory uncertainty subsides, the stock will return to a recovery rally, creating an opportunity for 30-40% capital appreciation."},

How about considering some TSX  bank stocks  that are known for delivering attractive and reliable dividends for decades. Such reliable  dividend stocks  from the Canadian banking sector can not only provide you with a steady source of passive income but also offer the potential for capital appreciation in the long run. In addition, most TSX bank stocks have underperformed the broader market in the last couple of years due mainly to the challenging macroeconomic environment, making them look  undervalued  to buy now. In this article, I’ll highlight two top bank stocks on the  Toronto Stock Exchange  that have attractive dividend yields of up to 7% and strong growth prospects. Laurentian Bank of Canada stock While  Laurentian Bank of Canada  ( TSX:LB ) is not among Canada’s five largest banks, it’s still a reputable and well-established financial institution with over 175 years of track record in its domain. This Montréal-headquartered bank currently has a  market cap  of $1.2 billion as its stock trades at $27.54 per share after rising by around 7% in the last six months. At this market price, LB stock offers an impressive 7% annualized dividend yield and distributes its dividend payouts every quarter. In the 12 months ended in January 2024, Laurentian Bank’s adjusted earnings  slipped  by 15.7% YoY (year over year) to nearly $4.29 per share as lower loan volumes continued to hurt its interest income. On the positive side, the bank reported an improvement in its net interest margin last quarter as stable interest rates strengthened its product margins. Laurentian Bank’s provisions for credit losses have increased in recent quarters as the ongoing economic uncertainties hurt the credit quality of its customers. Nonetheless, its strong liquidity levels and robust capital position continue to help it navigate this period of economic uncertainty. As potential interest rate cuts in the near term increase the demand for its financial services, Laurentian Bank’s financial growth trends could improve significantly going forward, which should help its share prices rise. Scotiabank stock Bank of Nova Scotia  ( TSX:BNS ) or Scotiabank is another fundamentally strong TSX bank stock you can bet on right now to earn passive income from its reliable dividends. Based on its market cap of $80.8 billion, Scotiabank is currently the fourth-largest Canadian bank, as its stock trades at $65.73 per share after rising 11% in the last six months. Just like Laurentian Bank, BNS stock also distributes its dividends on a monthly basis and has an attractive annualized dividend yield of 6.5% at the current market price. One of the main factors that sets Scotiabank apart from most other financial institutions is its diversified business model with a strong presence in high-growth international markets. Its consistent focus on diversification is the main reason why Scotiabank’s total revenues went up 4.5% YoY to $32.8 billion in the four quarters ended January 2024. Although higher provisions for credit losses have affected the bank’s profitability of late, expected improvements in the economic outlook in the coming years should boost its earnings growth trend. Moreover, Scotiabank’s consistent focus on margin expansion, disciplined expense management, and revenue growth across core segments brightens its long-term growth outlook."},

For example, in the last decade, an initial investment of $10,000 transformed into approximately $116,970. Roughly 76% of returns came from price appreciation and 24% from dividends. That said, the trajectory of its stock price, as shown in the graph below, illustrates the riskiness of the stock. At times, the dividend stock can experience massive declines in its stock price.  GSY 10-year stock price data by YCharts The last big drop from late 2021 to 2022 was triggered by a super rally from the 2020 pandemic market crash. The rally stretched the stock to stratospheric levels that were never before seen in the stock’s trading history.  At the peak, it traded at about 22 times earnings, which didn’t seem irrational at the time given the actual double-digit earnings growth in the underlying business. However, investors could rationalize that the stock’s long-term normal valuation is more or less a  price-to-earnings ratio  of 12. From this perspective, the stock was overvalued in 2021 and it was only a matter of time before the valuation normalized, perhaps waiting on a trigger like a new interest rate-cutting cycle in 2022.  Investors need not fear another massive decline of the kind in 2021/22 because the stock trades at just under 12 times earnings, which implies a fairly valued stock. If the stock does fall from current levels and maintains earnings growth, the correction is likely an opportunity to buy the growth stock at a discount.  Let’s see what its recent results tell us. Earlier this month, goeasy reported its first quarter (Q1) results for the year. The leading Canadian non-prime lender continues to deliver solid results. It witnessed loan originations rising 12% to $686 million, loan growth of 6% to $207 million, the loan portfolio rising 29% to $3.9 billion, revenues rising 24% to $357 million, and adjusted earnings per share climbing 24% to $3.80. Return on equity for the quarter was 21.9%, which was still high.  Perhaps what worries investors is the macro environment. Interest rates have gone higher since 2022, making debt costlier and increasing the likelihood of Canadians not being able to pay interest or pay back loans. Statistics Canada indicated that the household debt service ratio rose from 13.5% in Q1 2021 to 15.2% in Q3 2023.  For now, goeasy is fine. As for the first quarter, it reported a net charge-off rate of 9.1%, which was still within its estimated range of 8.5% and 9.5%. However, if it edges higher, investors would see it as a red flag.  Long-term investors are probably okay buying the stock here, especially if they’re building a position over time. For example, ignoring the volatility in between, the stock delivered annualized returns of 29% per year from August 2013, when it was trading at about 12 times earnings. That is, it transformed an initial investment of $10,000 into about $156,488 for returns of about 1,465% in the period.  Since there is always a demand for non-prime consumer lending and goeasy continues to serve a good portion of that market, the stock is likely to maintain growth in the long run. Management has been operating the business well, and it is likely to navigate fine through whatever comes the company’s way.  At $178 per share at writing, the stock offers a dividend yield of 2.6% – a dividend that it increased by 27% per year over the last decade. Since the stock is fairly valued, it is at least a “hold.” For interested investors looking for a bigger margin of safety, they might consider buying shares on meaningful market corrections."},

But if you pick the right growth stocks, they won’t just help you build wealth over time for your retirement years but can also push your portfolio up in the short term. If you want to boost your portfolio by next year, three stocks should be on your radar. An insurance company Canada is home to some of the largest life insurance companies in the world, but if you are looking for adequate growth, it’s the Canadian Property and Casualty (P&C) insurance giant  Intact Financial  ( TSX:IFC ) that you should consider buying.  The company currently has 10 brands under its banner, operates in several countries and is among the largest insurance companies (in its category) in Canada, the U.K., and Ireland. It has also been one of Canada’s most rewarding insurance stocks for some time now. It doubled its investors’ money in the last five years through price appreciation alone, and if you throw in the dividends, the overall returns have become 124%. The numbers are even more impressive if we look at the last decade’s returns. An alternative financial company Another financial sector stock that may help you increase your wealth by next year is  goeasy  ( TSX:GSY ). It’s an alternative financial company that offers small personal loans and other financial products to people who do not have enough credit scores to qualify for a loan from the bank.  That’s a massive, underserved market in Canada, and goeasy has experienced robust growth over the years by catering to this market. goeasy has an impressive footprint, with over 400 locations nationwide. It’s also one of the most generous Dividend Aristocrats on the market right now if you consider its dividend growth. However, its capital-appreciation potential is the most impressive factor to consider right now.  In the last 12 months, the stock rose by about 61%, and if it manages to repeat this performance in the coming year, it can give your portfolio a solid boost. A property management company FirstService  ( TSX:FSV ) is North America’s largest manager of residential communities, with an impressive portfolio of over 9,000 communities, mainly in the United States. And that’s just one-half of its business. The other complementary half is essential property services like construction, painting, and roofing. It has been a solid growth stock since the beginning and has grown over 500% since its inception. It’s also a dividend payer, and even though the payout ratio and dividend growth are both impressive, the yield is not. At 0.67%, the yield may not be reason enough to consider this stock, but its capital-appreciation potential is. Foolish takeaway The three growth stocks can help you boost your wealth to a certain extent by next year, making them short-term solid picks. But they are also excellent long-term picks, and you can buy and hold them for years, even decades, to slowly build your wealth and your retirement funds.  Even though their yields are not comparable to their growth potential, you can still hold them in your  Tax-Free Savings Account  (TFSA) if your goal is to start a passive income with these stocks."},
{"source_name": "The Motley Fool", "title": "Canopy Growth: Buy, Sell, or Hold?", "title_link": "https://www.fool.ca/2024/05/14/canopy-growth-buy-sell-or-hold/", "published_date": "May 14, 2024", "publisher_name": "Amy Legate-Wolfe", "Description": "There are numerous reasons that investors have been considering  Canopy Growth  ( TSX:WEED ) on the TSX today. But perhaps the biggest reason of all has been the recent news from the United States. Word has gotten out that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) will be reclassifying  cannabis . That is, as long as it gets the approval through a public hearing. Even it will take quite some time to come into effect. But why does this matter for Canopy Growth stock? U.S. expansion The rescheduling of marijuana as a Schedule I narcotic is huge, and we can’t pretend that it isn’t. Right now, it’s classified with the likes of heroin. But by classifying it as a Schedule III substance, it would be put in the same class as Tylenol with codeine. This would also improve the stigma around marijuana, and not just improve those caught holding marijuana on their person illegally. And this reduction in the stigma surrounding marijuana should help companies like Canopy Growth stock grow further. Less stigma means more acceptance by the population. More acceptance means the approval on a state basis of marijuana use for  medicinal  and recreational means — something that more than half of the U.S. already approves of. How Canopy Growth stock benefits Canopy Growth stock and its investors have long been waiting on federal approval of marijuana. And that’s bound to happen in our lifetime. While we’re still about halfway through all states legalizing it recreationally, this has sped up in the last few years. Canopy Growth stock is therefore looking to be the largest producer of marijuana in the largest market in the world. In fact, the U.S. cannabis market is projected to be worth over US$50 billion by 2026. This would make it the largest legal market in the world. Through purchases of U.S. companies, Canopy Growth stock stands to see a massive increase in revenue and profitability. The company would also benefit from economies of scale and streamline operations across its entire U.S. cannabis holdings, leading to cost reductions and improved profitability. Furthermore, Canopy Growth stock is already well known. Federal legalization would allow them to leverage their brand recognition in the U.S., potentially giving them a head start in this new market. So, while there are still hurdles to overcome, Canopy Growth stock looks like a strong contender. Bottom line Whether investors want to buy, sell, or hold Canopy Growth stock certainly depends on your risk portfolio. Cannabis stocks are still risky, and Canopy Growth stock is no exception. For now, buying Canopy Growth stock could be a good idea if you’re looking to hold it for the next decade. In that time, we should see the marijuana market improve, and hopefully see the company reach profitability. If you want to sell, though, now could be the time after a boost in share price — that is, if you need the cash. But if you don’t, I would just park it. As mentioned, the market is bound to improve. While it’s unclear when that might be, Canopy Growth stock does stand to make a killing eventually. So, if you’re a patient investor, it might be worth your while."},

Their deadline to file 2023 tax returns is on or before June 15, 2024 (but the tax payment date is April 30). The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) did not introduce new tax credits this year, but I hope everyone got all the applicable credits or incentives and paid lower taxes. Knowing the CRA credits and where they apply is more important than having an accountant prepare your tax returns. Early preparation is always the key to having more confidence before the next tax season. Enhanced BPA The federal government’s amendments to the Income Tax Act in 2019 include the basic personal amount (BPA). All individual taxpayers can claim or are entitled to claim the BPA. This non-refundable tax credit is deducted from your earnings to reduce the taxable income. For the tax year 2024, the BPA is $15,705, and you can deduct the amount from your total income, not to exceed $173,705 (e.g., $40,000 – $15,705 = $24,295 taxable income). Canada Training Credit The Canada Training Credit (CTC) is a refundable tax credit for taxpayers ages 26 to 65 who are studying and paying tuition and other fees to an eligible educational institution. You can claim 50% of the eligible tuition or the CTC limit indicated in your latest notice of assessment or reassessment, whichever is lower. The CRA’s maximum limit in a lifetime is $5,000. Canada Caregiver Credit The Canada Caregiver Credit (CCC) is a non-refundable tax credit available to taxpayers who support a spouse, common-law partner, or dependent with a physical or mental impairment. Your support to an infirm eligible spouse or dependent should cover some or all basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter. The CCC amount can be from $2,499 up to $7,999, as indicated on the specific lines on the tax return. Seed capital CRA tax credits, particularly the BPA, are significant and can be  seed capital  for dividend investing. You can transform $15,705 into a recurring passive income stream by investing in  IGM Financial  ( TSX:IGM ) or  B2Gold  ( TSX:BTO ). The former is an established wealth and asset management firm, while the latter is a gold producer with operating mines in three countries. IGM is a $9.1 billion subsidiary of  Power Corporation , an international management and holding company. In Q1 2024, IGM’s adjusted net earnings available to common shareholders increased 8.8% year over year to a record $224.5 million. Besides the low 52.2% payout ratio, IGM has never missed a quarterly dividend payment since 2002. At $38.35 per share, you can partake in the generous 5.87% dividend. B2Gold is a low-cost international senior gold producer. The $3.4 billion Canadian  mining company  owns and operates gold mines in Mali, Namibia, and the Philippines. In Q1 2024, gold revenue and net income declined 2.6% and 52.4% year over year respectively to $461.4 million and $48.5 million. However, total gold production (225,716 ounces) was in line with expectations, and cash provided by operating activities jumped 248.7% to $710.7 million compared to Q1 2023. If you invest today ($3.80 per share), B2Gold’s dividend offer is 6.11%.     Put tax credits to work. CRA credits are more than tax savings. You can make more money by investing them in income-producing assets like dividend stocks."},

If so, the good news is that the Canadian stock market offers plenty of such opportunities! I’m talking about  fundamentally  strong TSX  dividend stocks  that could practically be seen as coiled springs, ready to jump up and boost your passive income to new heights. Whether you’re just starting out or looking to beef up your investment portfolio, such trustworthy dividend stocks could help you achieve your financial goals faster. In this article, I’ll introduce you to two of the best TSX dividend stocks you can consider buying in 2024 and holding for decades. BCE stock Whether you’re investing in dividend stocks for passive income or looking for long-term capital appreciation, you should always carefully analyze the financial growth trends and fundamental outlook of the company you’re investing in. Doing so can help you filter out stocks with low growth prospects or unsustainable payouts. One TSX dividend stock that passes this test with flying colours is  BCE  ( TSX:BCE ). This Canadian telecommunications giant has consistently raised its dividends for 16 years in a row, regardless of economic cycles. BCE has a  market cap  of $42.3 billion as its stock trades at $46.39 per share with nearly 11% year-to-date losses. These declines in its share prices, however, increased its annualized dividend yield, which currently stands at a solid 8.6%. In the March quarter, BCE  achieved  the highest first-quarter mobile phone postpaid net activations since 2018, up 4.5% YoY (year over year) to 45,247. Similarly, it was the best first quarter for the company’s retail internet net subscriber activations since 2007, up 13.9% YoY to 31,078, indicating strong demand for their services despite the ongoing economic challenges. To add optimism, its subsidiary Bell Media’s digital revenue surged by 33% YoY last quarter, driven by strong performance in digital platforms and advertising technology. Economic uncertainties and a shift in consumer behaviour have affected BCE’s earnings in recent quarters. Nonetheless, the company’s focus on reducing capital expenditures while maintaining growth in key areas such as 5G and fibre deployments suggests a balanced approach, which should help its financials improve in the coming years and its share prices recover fast. Manulife Financial stock Manulife Financial  ( TSX:MFC ) could be another fundamentally strong TSX dividend stock for investors seeking to earn reliable passive income. This Toronto-headquartered financial services giant has a market cap of $63.1 billion as its stock trades at $35.14 per share after surging by 20% so far in 2024. MFC stock offers a decent 4.6% annualized dividend yield at the current market price. The recent strength in Manulife’s shares could be attributed to its ability to continue posting strong earnings growth even in a difficult economic environment. In the last four quarters ended in March 2024, the company’s adjusted earnings have surged 15.7% YoY to $3.61 per share with the help of strong business growth across its insurance segments. Besides the continued strength in its earnings growth trends, the company’s robust capital position and focus on digital transformation brighten its long-term growth outlook, which should help its share prices continue soaring."},

Brookfield Renewable stock recently surged in share price after a record quarter. Shares have jumped since the end of April, up a whopping 35% between April 30 and May 10. Yet there are more reasons than this current growth to consider Brookfield Renewable stock. So let’s get right into it. The finances First there’s the recent earnings report, with Brookfield Renewable reporting record earnings during its first quarter. Despite a net loss attributable to unitholders for the quarter, Brookfield Renewable reported Funds From Operations (FFO) of US$296 million.  This marked an 8% increase compared to the prior year. This growth reflects solid resources across its hydro fleet, and the impact from development and growth initiatives. Such robust financial performance demonstrates the resilience and profitability of its  renewable energy assets . Furthermore, with US$4.4 billion of available liquidity and a strong balance sheet, Brookfield Renewable has the financial flexibility to deploy significant capital into growth initiatives. The company has been actively strengthening its balance sheet through strategic financings and repurchasing its units, demonstrating its commitment to enhancing shareholder value. More partnerships Brookfield Renewable already made one strong choice last year by partnering with  Cameco  ( TSX:CCO ) for Westinghouse Electric. This alone would bring in significant revenue. However, Brookfield Renewable has forged more strategic partnerships with leading global corporations like  Microsoft  ( NASDAQ:MSFT ). This demonstrates its ability to deliver scale to clean power solutions to meet the growing demand for renewable energy. The landmark agreement with Microsoft to deliver over 10.5 gigawatts of additional renewable energy capacity signifies the company’s capacity to cater to the needs of tech giants driving the digitalization and cloud computing trends. Leading power provider  As the demand for clean energy escalates, Brookfield Renewable is positioned as a leading provider of clean power, particularly to the digitalizing global economy. Its diverse portfolio of renewable energy assets, including hydro, wind, solar, and distributed energy, enables it to offer tailored solutions to meet the evolving needs of its customers, resulting in favourable contracting opportunities. We’ve already seen this through partnerships like those with Microsoft and Cameco. And it’s likely to climb even higher given its exposure as a top renewable energy operator. Growth to come  The company continues to progress development activities and expects to bring on approximately 7,000 megawatts of new renewable capacity this year. Additionally, asset recycling activities are expected to generate US$3 billion of proceeds, enhancing its financial position and creating opportunities for further growth and value creation. This has also supported the company’s  dividend growth . Brookfield Renewable stock targets a sustainable distribution with annual increases averaging between 5% to 9%. This commitment to providing consistent and growing distributions enhances the attractiveness of the investment for income-focused investors. Valuable dividend stock Right now, shares may have climbed by 35%. However, Brookfield Renewable stock still provides a valuable opportunity. Shares offer a dividend yield at 5.15% as of writing. Furthermore, BEP.UN trades at a valuable 1.8 times book value as of writing. So with shares still down 13% in the last year and climbing higher, and more growth on the way, Brookfield Renewable stock is a solid buy on the  TSX  today."},

Against this backdrop, here are four absurdly cheap  Canadian stocks  long-term investors could buy now with $500.  Lightspeed Speaking of absurdly cheap stocks with solid growth prospects, one could consider investing in  Lightspeed  ( TSX:LSPD ). Shares of this  technology company  are down about 36% year to date and are trading at the next-12-month (NTM) enterprise value to sales (EV/sales) multiple of 1.3, which is too cheap to ignore. While Lightspeed stock trades cheaply, it is well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing digital shift. The company’s comprehensive software platform and unified suite of tools catering diverse needs of small- and medium-sized businesses, which will likely drive demand for its offerings. In addition to benefiting from secular tailwinds like digital shift, Lightspeed is set to gain from its growing base of high gross transaction volume (GTV) customers. These customers, who use multiple company modules, have a lower churn risk and contribute significantly to the company’s average revenue per user (ARPU), supporting sustainable earnings in the long term.  Well Health Shares of the digital healthcare company  WELL Health Technologies  ( TSX:WELL ) is another top stock that is trading absurdly cheap. For instance, WELL Health stock is trading at an NTM EV/sales ratio of 1.4, which reflects a discount of over 80% from its historical average. While shares of this digital healthcare company are trading cheaply, it continues to generate solid sales and is focusing on profitable growth.  The company’s omnichannel business model, predictable revenue base, growing patient visits, and comprehensive cost-cutting program will likely drive its top and bottom lines. In addition, WELL Health’s accretive acquisitions and focus on strengthening its position in artificial intelligence (AI)-powered preventative care augur well for long-term growth.  Shopify  Shopify  ( TSX:SHOP ) stock has lost more than 22% of its value year to date on fears of a slowdown in e-commerce. Barring short-term concerns, Shopify’s fundamentals remain strong, and the company is well-positioned to gain from the shift in selling models toward multi-channel platforms.  Shopify’s multi-channel sales platform, diverse offerings such as payment processing and shipping solutions, and focus on adding new merchant features and incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) in its products bode well for growth. Further, its cost-reduction initiatives and focus on delivering sustainable profit are positives.  Ballard Power Systems The final stock on this list is  Ballard Power Systems  ( TSX:BLDP ). The stock is down about 31% in one year, reflecting the widening losses and softness in its order book due to macro uncertainty. Nonetheless, the long-term prospects of Ballard Power System remain solid, as its products have applications in electric buses, battery-electric vehicles, and trucks. This implies that Ballard Power will likely benefit from vehicle electrification.  The company develops proton exchange membrane fuel cell products and is poised to benefit from the growing adoption of zero-emission products. Moreover, its focus on new product launches, growing customer base, expansion of manufacturing capacity, and cost-reduction initiatives will likely drive its financials and share price."},

The rising cost of items at every single store in the country has certainly made sure of that. Soaring inflation is likely why dividend stocks have become so popular once again. Yet when it comes to these high-yielding dividend stocks, you’re not just gaining exposure to high passive income. You’re also gaining access to a long-term hold. With that in mind, today we’re going to look at three high-yield  dividend stocks  that continue to fit the bill. CIBC If you’re looking for safety and passive income, then  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce  ( TSX:CM ) belongs on your list. CIBC stock continues to be a strong dividend stock with a current dividend yield at 5.33% as of writing. What’s more, CIBC stock has been seeing improvements in its earnings. After earnings that barely scraped by estimates, or missed them entirely, the first quarter soared past estimates. This put the company in a strong position, with its Canadian clients continuing to remain loyal to the brand. Furthermore, CIBC stock continues to look like a deal when digging into its fundamentals. It trades at just 10.3 times earnings over the past year, demonstrating that the stock continues to trade under its intrinsic value – especially when adding that it trades at 1.3 times book value, even with shares up 18% in the last year! So I would certainly consider this high-yielding dividend stock while it continues to offer a yield higher than its five-year average of 5.28%. TC Energy Another company offering an ultra-high dividend yield while also providing long-term income is  TC Energy  ( TSX:TRP ). This energy provider has also been a huge dividend stock provider, holding a yield at 7.28% as of writing. Now, TRP stock has long been a pipeline company. And that was great in the past. But the company is now slowly but surely transitioning over to renewables as well. This provides investors with a long-term investment opportunity. Right now, you can still gain from the long-term contracts providing stable cash flow. However, you also don’t have to worry about a fall in the future, given that it’s investing in renewables as well. Meanwhile, TRP stock currently trades at 20.2 times earnings, which is still lower than its five-year average of 25.6 times earnings. It also trades at just 2 times book value, with shares down 6% in the last year. Yet after a massive fall in April, the stock is up 8.3% and climbing back to 52-week highs. So again, I would grab this dividend stock while it still offers a dividend that’s far higher than its five-year average of 5.75%. Canadian Utilities Now if you’re really looking for solid long-term income from a dividend stock, then  Canadian Utilities  ( TSX:CU ) has likely already come to your attention. With a dividend yield at 5.69%, CU stock is a strong option. And one you can look forward to growing year after year. As with TRP stock, the company is an energy provider. Yet while this involves some gas production, it’s also invested in other types of energy production. All to power the utilities we use on a daily basis. And the company has managed to be such a strong cash flow generator that it was the very first  Dividend King  on the  TSX . This means it’s been increasing its dividend each year for the last 50 years! So with shares trading at just 14.9 times earnings, and down 19% in the last year, it looks like a strong time to buy. Especially while trading at 1.6 times book value, and its earnings are lower than its five-year average of 19.4 times earnings. Shares have started to climb once more, so I would certainly consider this dividend stock as well for high-yield income for life."},

It’s all about catching great stocks before they make their big move. While the  Canadian stock market  has seen a sharp rally in the last six months, with the  TSX Composite Index  last week posting a fresh all-time high, many attractive  growth stocks  still appear  undervalued  based on their long-term growth potential. Buying such growth stocks when they’re cheap could help you earn handsome returns in the long run. In this article, I’ll highlight two such TSX growth stocks that look poised to boom and could deliver stellar returns in the coming years. These are the kind of stocks you’ll want to buy before they become too expensive. Aritzia stock Aritzia  ( TSX:ATZ ) is the first TSX growth stock you can consider adding to your portfolio right now. If you don’t know it already, it’s a Vancouver-based integrated design house that operates an e-commerce platform and a network of boutiques in the United States and Canada. ATZ currently has a  market cap  of $3.8 billion as its stock trades at $34.09 per share after sliding by around 10% in the last three months. In the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2024 (ended in February), Aritzia  reported  a 7% YoY (year-over-year) increase in its total revenue to $682 million. It was the third consecutive quarter when the company’s YoY sales growth rate continued to improve. More importantly, its revenue in the United States grew positively by 9.4% last quarter, reflecting a strong market performance and potential for future expansion. Even as its e-commerce platform sales declined, Aritzia’s retail sales jumped 14.7% from a year ago in the February quarter, driven by the success of new and repositioned boutiques, showcasing its effective retail strategies. Going forward in its fiscal year 2025 (started in March 2024), the company expects its sales growth rate to improve further, with plans for 20% to 25% YoY square footage growth. Also, the momentum in its e-commerce and the successful implementation of initiatives like “buy online and ship from store” hint towards its well-thought-out approach to capture market share both online and offline, which should accelerate its financial growth in the years to come. BlackBerry stock BlackBerry  ( TSX:BB ) is another TSX growth stock that I find really attractive right now based on its long-term growth outlook, especially due to its increasing focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning-based tech solutions. This Waterloo-based company currently has a market cap of $2.5 billion as its stock trades at $4.23 per share after rising by 15% in the last three months. Even as the ongoing macroeconomic challenges continue to affect the demand for enterprise tech solutions globally, BlackBerry’s total revenue in the last 12 months (ended in February) has jumped by 30% YoY to US$853 million. The company’s adjusted net profit for these four quarters stood strong at US$31 million, far better compared to its adjusted net loss of US$103 million in the previous four quarters. As the demand for its AI-powered enterprise cybersecurity and Internet of Things tech solutions is expected to surge in the next decade, BlackBerry’s earnings growth trend could improve significantly and help its share prices rally."},

The stocks are currently on sale right but are ready to rebound in 2024. Growth-oriented power producer Capital Power is down 13.22% from a year ago, but the year-to-date loss has improved to -0.12%. If you invest today and buy on weakness, you can partake in the generous 6.61%. The quarterly payout should be safe, given the low 46.37% payout ratio. The $4.8 billion growth-oriented power producer caters to communities in Canada and the United States. Capital Power owns renewable and thermal power generation facilities (32 total) with a combined we own approximately 9,300 megawatts (MW) of power generation capacity of approximately 9,300 MW. In the first quarter (Q1) of 2024, revenue and net income declined 11.7% and 28.1% year over year to $1.11 billion and $205 million. Still, its president and chief executive officer (CEO), Avik Dey, said, “We  delivered  affordable and reliable power across our diverse and strategically positioned fleet of flexible generation assets.” Capital Power has good news for  clean and green investors . Management said the company will be entirely off coal by mid-2024 with the startup of its simple cycle unit 2. Dey added that the deals to acquire the La Paloma and Harquahala generation assets are almost complete. Besides the diversified footprint into strategic regions, Capital Power will provide reliable, affordable power. Softening demand Mullen Group said the economy is slowing, as reflected in the lower-than-expected top and bottom-line first-quarter results. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, revenue and net income fell 7.1% and 30% to $462.6 million and $22.2 million versus Q1 2023. This $1.13 billion company is one of Canada’s largest logistics providers. “Consumer demand continued to decline, capital investment in Canada was noticeably weaker, and major project construction activity virtually ground to a halt.  It’s no wonder our results were down year over year,” said Murray K. Mullen, chairman and senior executive officer of Mullen. However, he added that the diversified business model helps mitigate rapid changes in the market. Mullen can pursue acquisitions and boasts a core competency and competitive advantage. Management announced acquiring ContainerWorld Forwarding Services and its operating subsidiaries. The well-established company offers integrated supply chain solutions to the alcoholic beverage and hospitality industries. Like Capital Power, Mullen’s 5.63% dividend and monthly payout compensate for the temporary weakness. The share price is $12.78 (-7.45% year to date).  Deep discount Spin Master trades at a deep discount. At $29.01 per share, the year-to-date loss is 16.64%. The $3.01 billion global, fully-imagined children’s entertainment company is turning 30 soon, but business could have been better lately. While revenue in Q1 2024 increased 16.5% year over year to US$316.2 million, net loss widened to US$54.8 million compared to US$1.9 million in Q1 2023. Its global president and CEO, Max Rangel, said the first quarter is typically the lowest quarter seasonally for the toy industry. Spin Master acquired Melissa & Doug early this year. According to management, the trusted brand in early childhood play is a strategic acquisition. Rangel assures that Melissa & Doug complements Spin Master’s existing toy portfolio as it expands capabilities in early childhood play. Market analysts recommend a buy rating. Their 12-month average price target is $41.90 (+43.2%). TOY also pays a 1.65% dividend. Earn two ways Capital Power, Mullen Group, and Spin Master are stocks on sale but poised to rebound in 2024, if not soon. You can earn two ways from them: dividends and price appreciation."},

Yield-thirsty investors on the hunt for generous  dividend payers  have three lucrative options. Atrium Mortgage Investment Corporation  ( TSX:AI ),  Acadian Timber  ( TSX:ADN ), and  InPlay Oil  ( TSX:IPO ) fly under the radar, are outperforming the market, and have surprisingly strong dividends. High-quality opportunities Atrium deserves serious consideration following an exceptional year amid a challenging lending environment. The provider of residential and commercial mortgage services achieved several records last year. Because of its highest annual income in history, the $490.5 million non-bank lender declared a record special dividend ($0.29 per share).  In the 12 months ending December 2023, net income rose 11.1% year over year to a record $51.5 million versus 2022, despite the provision for mortgage losses rising 521.4% year over year to $11.9 million. The $893.6 million record mortgage portfolio represents a 3.2% increase from the prior year. Notably, 94.6% of Atrium’s portfolio is first mortgages, while the average loan-to-value is 64.1%. Management seized high-quality opportunities due to reduced activity from institutional lenders. Performance-wise, current investors are up 9% year to date. If you invest today, the share price is $11.16, while the dividend yield is 8.12%. The monthly payout, not quarterly, is an added enticement.  Profitable lumber and wood business Acadian Timber owns vast freehold timberlands in New Brunswick and Maine. The $307.6 million company provides timber services and produces softwood and hardwood sawlogs, pulpwood, and biomass byproducts. It sells these products to regional customers. The lumber and wood production industry is erratic, but Acadian has consistently delivered yearly profits amid headwinds. In Q1 2024, timber sales and services and net income increased 6.8% and 7.2% year over year to $23.9 million and $6 million, respectively. Notably, free cash flow (FCF) soared 108.7% to $7.8 million from a year ago. According to its President and CEO, Adam Sheparski, timber sales volumes have rebounded at the start of the year. Also, Acadian recorded its first significant sale of carbon credits ($4.9 million) and entered a renewable energy option to lease. Management expects the improving long-term demand for new homes, repair, and remodel activity to support the demand for Acadian’s products. At $18.08 per share (+7.2% year to date), the dividend offer is an attractive 6.51% (quarterly payout). Ideal for frugal investors InPlay Oil is a cheap option for yield-thirsty but frugal dividend investors. At only $2.53 per share (+10.5% year to date), the dividend yield is a hefty 7.59%. Like Atrium, this energy stock pays monthly dividends. Given the 50% payout ratio, the payout should be sustainable. This $213.7 million company operates in West Central Canada, focusing on its concentrated light oil asset base in the Cardium Formation within the Pembina and Willesden Green pools. InPlay Oil has delivered positive earnings every year since 2020 during the oil price war and coronavirus breakout. In Q4 2023, light oil production reached a quarterly record of 4,142 barrels per day (bbl/d), although net income declined 44.2% year over year to $11.6 million. For the year, InPlay returned $16.5 million to shareholders through the monthly base dividend and share repurchases. Income boosters Atrium Mortgage, Acadian Timber, or InPlay Oil are not typical anchors in a stock portfolio. However, they are excellent second-liners if you need a dividend or investment income boost."},

However, in addition to keeping your emotions in check and giving your money a long runway of growth, it’s also paramount to find the highest-quality stocks to buy, whether they are dividend, growth, or value stocks. That’s why I continue to buy shares of  Brookfield Infrastructure Partners  ( TSX:BIP.UN ), which is, in my opinion, one of the very best stocks on the TSX, especially to buy and hold for years to come. What’s most intriguing about Brookfield is that it’s one of the best stocks in Canada at offering investors both a resilient, defensive business and one that can grow significantly. When you can find a stock that does both, protects your capital in times of turmoil, and offers significant growth potential over the  long haul , they’re often some of the best companies on the market. Although it owns assets that a typical low-risk, defensive business would own — one that’s safe and reliable but also doesn’t offer significant growth potential — Brookfield is also consistently looking at where it can find growth next and which of its assets it can sell to recycle the capital into a new, higher potential opportunity. That’s why, while Brookfield Infrastructure trades off its highs and offers a yield of roughly 5.3%, it’s a stock I continue to buy shares of. In this environment, safe and secure dividend stocks are some of the best to buy It’s never a bad idea to own safe, recession-resistant stocks, especially when the economic environment is so uncertain, such as what we continue to experience today. However, as important as it is to own safe stocks that can protect your capital and reliable dividend stocks that can continue to earn you a return no matter what the state of the economy, owning too many defensive stocks can affect your portfolio’s growth potential over the long run, unless these stocks have significant growth potential themselves. That’s why Brookfield is such an ideal stock to buy and hold for years. The infrastructure assets it owns, such as utilities, pipelines, railroads, ports and more, are all essential assets with robust and resilient operations. This ensures that Brookfield will see strong revenue and cash flow generation whether the economy is growing or potentially entering a  recession . Furthermore, with roughly two-thirds of Brookfield Infrastructure’s assets indexed to inflation, the company has a natural hedge against surging inflation or higher-for-longer interest rates. Therefore, in addition to its long-term growth potential, Brookfield is one of the best dividend stocks to buy now because you can have confidence in its ability to remain profitable in the short term while also earning you an attractive return through its approximately 5.3% yield. With that being said, though, the number one reason to buy Brookfield is for its significant growth potential, and not just the potential for significant capital gains, but also because Brookfield is consistently increasing the distribution it pays to investors as well. Brookfield offers a tonne of long-term growth potential I mentioned earlier that Brookfield is constantly looking at selling off assets and recycling that capital into new opportunities, which is why it can consistently grow the cash flow it generates as well as the funds it distributes to investors. However, in addition to selling off assets that it has turned around and improved and looking for new undervalued opportunities it believes it can buy cheaply and grow organically, Brookfield is also looking for essential assets in growing industries, such as the data centres and telecom towers it’s been acquiring in recent years. This way not only can it use its expertise to improve the profitability of the assets it owns, but by investing in businesses that have natural organic growth potential, Brookfield can improve its own growth prospects. Therefore, if you’ve got cash to invest today and want a high-quality stock you can buy now and hold for years or even decades to come, there’s no question that Brookfield Infrastructure is certainly one of the best dividend stocks on the TSX to consider today."},

Even as strong gains in metals prices across the board took shares of mining companies higher, most other key  sectors  on the  Toronto Stock Exchange  remained bearish, with industrials, technology, and energy leading the market selloff. Top TSX Composite movers and active stocks GFL Environmental  and  Lightspeed Commerce  were the worst-performing TSX stocks for the day, as they plunged by 3.6% each. On the positive side, shares of  Hudbay Minerals  ( TSX:HBM ) inched up by more than 14% to $13.71 per share after its upbeat first-quarter results boosted investors’ confidence. For the quarter ended in March, the Toronto-based copper miner  posted  a consolidated copper production of 34,749 tonnes and a higher-than-expected gold production of 90,392 ounces. These strong production numbers and higher commodity prices drove Hudbay’s quarterly revenue up by 77.8% year over year. Similarly, its adjusted net quarterly profit of US$57.6 million crushed Street analysts’ expectations of US$11.1 million by a huge margin. After the recent rally, HBM stock is now up 88% on a year-to-date basis. BlackBerry ,  First Quantum Minerals ,  NovaGold Resources , and  Ballard Power Systems  were also among the day’s top-performing TSX stocks as they rallied by at least 6.6% each. Based on their daily trade volume,  Enbridge , BlackBerry,  Suncor Energy ,  Cenovus Energy , and  Manulife Financial  were the most active TSX stocks on the exchange. TSX today Comex copper futures prices rallied to a fresh record high early Wednesday morning, which could lift most TSX  mining stocks  at the open today. Although no major domestic economic releases are due, Canadian investors will closely monitor the important consumer inflation report, retail sales numbers, and weekly crude oil stockpile data from the United States this morning, which could give further direction to stocks. On the corporate events front, many TSX-listed companies, including  Birchcliff Energy ,  Africa Oil ,  Northland Power ,  SNC-Lavalin ,  Boyd Group Services , and  Boralex , will release their latest quarterly earnings reports on May 15.

{"source_name": "The Motley Fool", "title": "Brookfield Stock Analysis: Should You Buy Today?", "title_link": "https://www.fool.ca/2024/05/15/brookfield-stock-analysis-should-you-buy-today/", "published_date": "May 15, 2024", "publisher_name": "Andrew Button", "Description": "Brookfield Corp  ( TSX:BN ) just released its earnings. The release beat analyst estimates, delivering $22.9 billion in revenue and $0.77 in distributable earnings per share (EPS), up 7% year over year. With a new earnings release comes a new opportunity to value a stock and decide whether it’s worth owning. In this article, I will explore whether Brookfield stock is worth owning following its first-quarter earnings release. Earnings breakdown Now that Brookfield has released its earnings, we can assess its performance in light of what was just revealed. In the first quarter, Brookfield delivered good results. Highlights included:   $22.9 billion in revenue, down 1.6%.   $1 billion in distributable earnings before realizations, up 6%.   $0.04 in diluted EPS, down 20%.   $0.77 in distributable EPS, up 7%.   $2.75 in wealth solutions earnings, up 88%.   As far as I can tell, earnings were ahead of what analysts expected. Scouring financial data platforms, I found a few with Brookfield estimates for the current quarter. They said that the average expectation was $0.70 – if the analysts were talking about distributable EPS, then Brookfield beat the estimate by 10%. Otherwise, it missed. Usually “adjusted earnings” is the earnings number that investors pay attention to, and DE is the closest thing to adjusted earnings that Brookfield reports. So, my feeling is that Brookfield delivered a beat. A modest valuation One way we could value Brookfield is by valuation multiples. These are the “stock ratios” you often hear about, such as the P/E ratio, price/book ratio, price/sales ratio, and more. At today’s prices, BN stock  trades at :   73 times last year’s earnings.   13.5 times forward earnings.   0.7 times sales.   20.5 times distributable earnings (this ratio calculated by the author using Brookfield’s  financial statements ).   1.7 times book value.   Although the P/E ratio based on last year’s reported earnings is high, the forward P/E ratio (based on analyst estimates of next year’s earnings) is quite low. The multiple calculated using distributable earnings – an asset management industry measure of profit available to pay dividends – is relatively modest. The remainder of the ratios are low. So, Brookfield appears fairly cheap. Respectable growth Another thing Brookfield has going for it is respectable historical growth. Over the last three years, the company compounded its revenue, earnings, and free cash flow at the following rates:   Revenue: 10.4%   Earnings from continuing operations: 93%   Free cash flow: 110%   These are compounded annual rates of growth (CAGR). So the total growth in the three-year period was even better than what the numbers above make it look like. Another noteworthy recent development for Brookfield was its deal to supply  Microsoft  with 10.5 billion gigawatts of clean energy over a five-year period. This deal could generate as much as $1.4 billion in recurring revenue for Brookfield’s subsidiary,  Brookfield Renewable.  Sixty percent of those earnings would be passed onto Brookfield. Foolish takeaway Brookfield Corporation has a lot of things going for it right now. It’s growing, it is signing big deals, and it’s putting out good earnings. There are risks with any stock. In Brookfield’s case, the high level of debt is one worth keeping an eye on. On the whole, though, this company has many good things going for it."},
{"source_name": "The Motley Fool", "title": "3 Bargains I’d Snatch Up as They Approach 52-Week Lows", "title_link": "https://www.fool.ca/2024/05/15/3-bargains-id-snatch-up-as-they-approach-52-week-lows/", "published_date": "May 15, 2024", "publisher_name": "Rajiv Nanjapla", "Description": "Canadian equity markets have bounced back strongly this month, with the  S&P/TSX Composite Index  rising by 2.44%. The easing of tensions in the Middle East and the Federal Reserve’s indication of no further rate hikes despite a lack of progress in inflation have increased investors’ confidence, driving the equity markets. Despite the recovery in the broader equity market, a few TSX stocks are still trading close to their 52-week lows. Notably, the following three bargain stocks offer attractive buying opportunities for long-term investors despite their near-term volatility. Lightspeed Commerce First on my list would be  Lightspeed Commerce  ( TSX:LSPD ), which offers omnichannel selling solutions to small- and medium-scale businesses. The company has been under pressure over the last few months amid an uncertain broader economic outlook and management’s cautious outlook. It has lost 40% of its stock value compared to its 52-week high and trades just 2% higher than its 52-week lows. Amid the steep correction, its valuation has declined to attractive levels, with its NTM (next 12 months)  price-to-sales  multiple at 1.9. Lightspeed has launched several products that provide data-driven insights, which could aid its customers in scaling their businesses and improving their customer experiences. Besides, its Unified Payments initiative has increased its Payment platform adoption, with its GPV (gross payment value) as a percentage of its GTV (gross transaction value) expanding to 29%. Further, the company’s management has taken reorganization and cost-reduction initiatives, such as trimming its workforce and integrating its recent acquisitions into two flagship products. These initiatives could improve operating efficiency and drive profitability in the coming quarters. Considering all these factors, I believe Lightspeed would be an excellent buy at these levels. WELL Health Technologies Another bargain stock I am bullish on is  WELL Health Technologies  ( TSX:WELL ). The tech-enabled healthcare company offers products and services to healthcare professionals for positive patient outcomes. The growing adoption of telehealthcare services and digitization of clinical procedures have created multi-year growth potential for the company. Besides, the company is investing substantially in artificial intelligence (AI)-powered products and services to enhance healthcare professionals’ productivity and efficiency. Further, WELL Health has expanded its footprint by acquiring 10 primary care medical clinics from Shoppers Drug Mart last month. It has also signed a five-year collaborative agreement with  Microsoft , which would integrate Microsoft Azure and its digital health platform to improve clinical outcomes and optimize expenses. The company continues to optimize its operations for organic growth and drive profitability for the rest of this year. WELL trades at an over 30% discount from its 52-week high while its NTM price-to-sales multiple has declined to 0.9, making it an attractive buy. Telus My final pick would be  Telus  ( TSX:T ), which has lost substantial value over the last two years. Higher interest rates and unfavourable regulatory decisions have weighed on the telecom sector, including Telus. T stock is down over 35% compared to its 2022 highs and is trading just 6% higher than its 52-week lows. Amid the steep sell-off, the company trades at 1.6 times analysts’ projected sales for the next four quarters. Despite the near-term weakness, I believe Telus would be an astute buy at these levels due to the growing demand for telecommunication services amid digitization and growth in remote working and learning. Meanwhile, the company is expanding its 5G and broadband infrastructure to drive growth. As of March 31, its 5G network covered 86% of the country’s population, while fibre-optic cable connected 3.2 million households and businesses. Besides, the company is also scaling its other growth segments, TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods, which could boost its financials in the coming years. Further, Telus’s management has raised its quarterly  dividend  by 7% to $0.3891/share, the 26 th  increase since May 2011. T’s forward dividend yield stands at an attractive 6.7%. Considering all these factors, I am bullish on Telus."},
{"source_name": "The Motley Fool", "title": "3 Bullish TSX Stocks on an Upward Trend", "title_link": "https://www.fool.ca/2024/05/15/3-bullish-tsx-stocks-on-an-upward-trend/", "published_date": "May 15, 2024", "publisher_name": "Amy Legate-Wolfe", "Description": "Canadian investors aren’t in a bullish trend quite yet. In fact, we’re still quite far away from it. While there continues to be some positivity in certain areas of the market, these areas are still quite volatile. We’ve seen this time and again since the beginning of this year. Whether it’s semiconductor stocks,  tech stocks , or dividend stocks, there have been many companies that have climbed, only to fall back down. However, in the case of these three TSX stocks, there seems to be an upward trend. So, let’s look at what’s making investors and analysts alike consider these three TSX stocks as long-term holds. Canadian Tire Analysts were bullish on the results coming out of  Canadian Tire  ( TSX:CTC.A ) last week, touting the company as off to a good start in 2024. In this case, analysts believe the company was “controlling the controllable,” sending earnings up 7% on strong results. First quarter results continued to demonstrate weakness in sales, especially among discretionary spending. Strength came from its long-term strong revenue creator, its automotive sector. However, management believes that more growth is coming as we near the summer season. So, while management is cautious about the second quarter, with demand and deal restocking improving, it’s a positive-looking TSX stock, especially in a challenging  retail  environment. So, with a dividend yield at 4.86% and shares still down 15% as of writing in the last year, it’s looking like a strong option among TSX stocks. Manulife Meanwhile,  Manulife Financial  ( TSX:MFC ) ramped up its share buybacks, and that ramped up a response from investors. Shares jumped as the company reported it would increase its buybacks from $200 million to around $600 million per quarter for the rest of the year. This would create roughly $5.5 billion in buybacks over the next five years. This came after Manulife stock saw a surge in its performance, especially in Asia. Furthermore, it closed a reinsurance deal, including the largest long-term-care component the insurance industry has ever experienced. Meanwhile, shares of the TSX stock have surged already in the last year. Shares are currently up 37% in the last year while still trading at a reasonable 15.28 times earnings. Furthermore, you can grab a dividend yield of 4.49%. And that should increase as with the buybacks. So, this is yet another bullish stock that’s due for even higher climbs. Shopify Alright, yes, shares of  Shopify  ( TSX:SHOP ) plunged about 21% after earnings this month. The company announced that while it saw a strong first quarter, it doesn’t expect the same thing for its second-quarter results. This led to price target cuts across the board. However, I would see this more as an opportunity rather than a warning. The drop in Shopify stock was oversold, with investors doing so in the wake of the market reaction. However, the TSX stock continues to show growth in its total addressable market, with more businesses adopting the company. So, as its market share gains increase, so too should its revenue and overall earnings. Shopify stock has a strong history of realizing high returns on investments, and that’s likely to continue over time. That means with shares still down, now could be the time to pick up Shopify stock before it soars once again."},

And the most recent one to enter headlines once again is X contributor Roaring Kitty. After going MIA over the last three years, X user, whose real name is Keith Gill, started up another bull run in meme stock favourite  GameStop  ( NYSE:GME ) this week, sending shares soaring. But could it all come crashing down once again? What happened First, let’s get into why Gill matters in the first place. Gill was hugely responsible for the surge in GameStop stock back in 2021, when the investor started posting about the video game retailer on X. Yet after the  pandemic  craze was over, the company left social media for a solid three years. Now, he’s back. Gill made his first social media post on May 13, 2024, of a man shifting from a laid-back position playing video games, to leaning forward and looking at full attention. The cryptic post sent users wild, and shares of GameStop stock soared once again. Since the post, shares of GameStop stock have surged an insane 218%, and are rising, as of writing. And the growth didn’t end there. Trickle-down effect While GameStop stock started rallying, other former meme stocks also saw a boost. This included  AMC  ( NYSE:AMC ) shares hurtling forward as well, up about 240% since the post came out. American companies weren’t the only ones seeing a rise. Canadian tech stock  BlackBerry  ( TSX:BB ) also enjoyed a huge increase in share price. Since the post came out, shares are up 26% on the  TSX . Yet the question is, how long can it last? ‘Gamification’ Analysts are terming the recent rally as another “gamification” in the markets, where investors try to get involved and “play.” However, it does cause one to wonder exactly who will come out as the winners, given the immense losses that occurred last year. That’s because this “gamification” is nothing short of gambling, as investors try to get the best results and the best price. Accordingly, many investors put cash into these markets aiming to see large gains in a short period of time. And if that’s not like gambling, I don’t know what is. Especially since the markets went on to see incredible losses. GameStop stock went from a share price of US$86.88 down to just US$10.15, a drop of 88%. AMC stock was similar, with shares at US$551.38 and then dropping to US$327, down 41%. And that was only the beginning, with shares going on to plunge downwards. Even now, with shares back up, AMC stock is only at US$9.61 per share as of writing. As for BlackBerry stock, shares almost fell as low as $18 before plunging  downwards , and even with the recent increase are only at $4.86. Stick to your guns While it can be fun to “play” the market sometimes, it’s always a good idea to stick to your long-term goals. If you want to gamble with some of your investments, then that’s up to you. But as with gambling, only use the cash you’re willing to lose completely. Because in the case of meme stocks, that looks highly likely."},

For Canadian investors looking to load up on  growth stocks , this is the account I think makes the most sense to take advantage of. That’s because, as its name suggests, any future capital gains aren’t taxed. So, if you hit a big winner that multiplies in value over the years, all those gains are yours to keep.  The difficult part is finding places to put this $7,000 to work that have the ability to truly multiply over time. In this article, I’m going to highlight three companies that have proven their ability to do just that, and appear to have plenty of juice left in the tank. Let’s dive in! Shopify Shopify  ( TSX:SHOP ) is an e-commerce giant providing global services to mid- and small-size businesses. The company operates with two business segments: subscription solutions and merchant solutions. The e-commerce platform’s cutting-edge technology enables merchants to design, manage, market, and sell their services and products more efficiently.  Although Shopify is an established Canadian giant, the company has ample opportunities to increase its business, which are yet to be explored. The company has 15% retail sales penetration in North America and plans to increase the penetration in the upcoming years. In addition, Shopify has an increasing presence in the offline market, as it has taken over 2% of the retail sales in North America and 0.5% globally. Shopify plans to increase its sales by 10% annually until 2028, making this stock a top growth name to own (particularly for those who think these estimates are light).  Constellation Software Constellation Software  ( TSX:CSU ) is a Canadian company that develops and customizes software for public and private sector banks. It has a specialty in acquiring, building, and managing vertical-specific businesses. The company operates with two business segments: the public sector and private sector.  Debuting in 2006, Constellation Software has provided returns of nearly 20,000% to early investors. That’s the kind of multiplication most investors are looking for. The stock’s chart trajectory is up and to the right, driven by a stable business model predicated on acquiring underperforming software businesses and improving their core numbers. This growth-by-acquisition strategy has paid off handsomely. Notably, there’s plenty of runway left for Constellation to continue consolidating the software space. Unlike other industries, this is a sector that remains highly fragmented. Accordingly, for investors with a long-term investing time horizon, this is a top growth stock I think is worth owning on any dips moving forward.  Open Text Corporation Open Text Corporation  ( TSX:OTEX ) is a tech giant based in Canada that enables clients to aggregate, archive, retrieve, and search unstructured information through its software. The company specializes in delivering software solutions and services to government entities, small and large businesses, and consumers to manage information.  Open Text has recorded growth for 12 consecutive quarters in annual recurring revenue, and its cloud bookings grew by 63% year over year to CA$236 million. Furthermore, Open Text has unveiled Cloud Editions 24.1 and innovative advancements in OpenText Aviator™.  Open Text is another option for investors looking to gain exposure to the high-growth (and high-margin) software space. In this sector, I think Open Text remains a top-tier option, defined by its current price-earnings ratio of more than 80 times. That’s not cheap, but it’s clear investors are paying up for quality. Indeed, for investors willing to do so, this is a stock I think is worth owning here."}
