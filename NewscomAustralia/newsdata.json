Some big changes are in the offing for the popular 7-Eleven brand, with the chief executive of the convenience store chain telling a retail gathering the company would take inspiration from its new Japanese owners to remake the business. Japanese retail giant 7-Eleven International took control of 7-Eleven Australia in November 2023 in a $1.71bn buyout. Chief executive Angus McKay said a Japan-inspired makeover was now on the cards for the small-store shops.  “Japanese stores … are the high mark around the global network. The way they present themselves, the store standards, the way they operate is just seamless and we’ve got a lot to learn from them,” he told a KPMG retail seminar on Tuesday. “‘We’ve been pushing for many years now to move away from being a pure chips and chocolate retailer.” 7-Eleven boasts 750 stores around the country, but the business is facing increased competition from other convenience retailers, including the Coles Express offering and a growing OTR empire.  Mr McKay said the new 7-Elevens would aim to match how Japanese 7-Eleven stores operate by offering more food, including fresh food, drinks and daily goods. Earlier in April, on announcing the completion of the takeover, 7-Eleven Australia said it would “expand product assortment and introduce new high quality fresh foods”.  “It is about continuing to grow our store network in Australia and providing unrivalled customer experiences and quality products,” Mr McKay said at the time. “My team and I are looking forward to taking advantage of 7-Eleven International’s deep experience in convenience retailing with the leadership of Executive Chairman, Shin Abe.” His address at Tuesday’s gathering also suggested the retailer could roll out a delivery service. Mr McKay added price inflation, higher interest rates and utility bills had impacted consumer spending. “It’s low relative real wage growth over a sustained period of time, higher interest rates, and it is absolutely (the cost of) utilities, which we don’t talk enough about, which really hurts the consumer,” he said. A popular soft drink product has been recalled from Coles, Woolies and Dan Murphy’s. Shoppers have described being locked down in Perth’s biggest shopping centre after a terrifying knife incident that left one man with a slash to the face, with two people on the run. A major Aussie retailer has made a green-thumbed move, with an orange twist, that most shoppers are likely to approve of. "},

Mining giant BHP has proposed a transformative $60bn takeover bid for coal and copper rival Anglo American in a deal that would reshape Australian and world mining.  The $230bn behemoth confirmed the mega mining deal on Friday morning, offering Anglo shareholders $48 a share in total value for a near $60bn all-share offer. “The combination would bring together the strengths of BHP and Anglo American in an optimal structure,” the company said.  “Anglo American would bring its assets and long-term growth potential. “BHP would bring its higher margin cash generative assets and growth projects along with its larger free cash flows and stronger balance sheet. “The combined entity would have a leading portfolio of large, low-cost, long-life Tier 1 assets focused on iron ore and metallurgical coal and future facing commodities, including potash and copper.” Stock in Anglo, a London-listed giant, jumped 16 per cent on the news and the company now boasts a market value of some $65.6bn. In Australia, Anglo mines steelmaking coal in Queensland’s Bowen Basin and holds a stake in a manganese mine in the Northern Territory.  Worldwide, the company boasts a spread of copper mines in Chile and Peru, iron ore operations in Brazil and South Africa, and diamonds and platinum mines in Africa. Copper is a target commodity for BHP, with chief executive Mike Henry increasingly vocal about the urgent need for greater copper production to meet the world’s decarbonisation ambitions. In a speech to the IEA Critical Minerals and Clean Energy Summit in Paris last year, Mr Henry said about $386bn of “growth capital” investment into copper could be needed in the next seven years to limit temperatures rises to 1.5C. “That is over and above sustaining capital,” he said. “But currently committed growth projects over this period only amount to around $US40 or $US50bn ($A77bn) today.” The miner acquired Oz Minerals in a $9.6bn transaction in 2023 to build out what it calls its “Copper South Australia” province, which now includes the Olympic Dam, Carrapateena and Prominent Hill mines. BHP’s key commodities are West Australian iron ore, South Australian copper and Queensland coal, and the company said Anglo’s assets would complement its own operations. “The benefits to BHP shareholders would include increasing BHP’s exposure to future facing commodities through Anglo American’s world class copper assets (and) complementing BHP’s iron ore and metallurgical coal portfolios with Anglo American’s high quality iron ore operations in Brazil and metallurgical coal operations in Queensland.” If the deal goes through, BHP would once more become the kingpin of Queensland’s coalfields, adding Anglo’s Moranbah, Grosvenor, Dawson and Aquila mines to its own Goonyella, Broadmeadow, Caval Ridge, Peak Downs and Saraji mines. The proposal would involve a spin-off of Anglo’s South African iron ore and platinum operations to Anglo shareholders.  BHP also said Anglo’s diamond business would be subject to a “strategic review” post transaction.  The offer is non-binding and subject to due diligence from both parties.  “This announcement does not amount to a firm intention to make an offer and there can be no certainty that an offer will be made,” BHP said. Shares in BHP tumbled on the news in early trading on Friday, slumping 4.1 per cent at the opening bell.  Health and workers’ rights advocates are pushing ministers to curtail asbestos, warning it could linger into the next century despite being banned in 2003. The Aussie sharemarket has remained strong in the wake of a less than ‘hawkish’ interest rates decision by the Reserve Bank of Australia. Ahead of the central bank’s impending interest rate decisions, investors on the Australian share market were in an upbeat mood. "},

The Australian sharemarket slumped on Wednesday after hotter-than-expected US labour data sparked a sharp sell-off on Wall St overnight.  The benchmark ASX 200 sank 1.23 per cent, or 94.20 points, to close at 7569.9, while the broader All Ordinaries index slumped 1.26 per cent, or 100.1 points, to finish at 7831.9. Rate sensitive technology stocks also suffered a pummelling, falling 1.53 per cent to 2968.8.  The bloodletting followed a rout on Wall St overnight on Tuesday that saw the benchmark Dow Jones fall 570 points, or 1.49 per cent, to 37,815, and the S&P 500 index plunge 1.57 per cent to 5035. The tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 2.04 per cent to 15,657.  The sell-off followed the release of data on labour costs in the US, which showed the country’s Employment Cost Index rising 1.2 per cent in the March quarter, accelerating from a 0.9 per cent increase in the prior quarter.  The figure has entrenched investor fears the US Federal Reserve will hold interest rates higher for longer as it navigates new uncertainty over the trajectory of inflation in the world’s largest economy. Capital.com senior financial market analyst Kyle Rodda said all eyes were now locked on Thursday morning’s Fed decision on interest rates and chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference. “It will be the language and guidance that could potentially change,” he said.  “The most likely scenario is that they will acknowledge the strength of the US economy, persistent inflation pressures and suggest that interest rates may need to remain at current levels for longer and maybe fewer cuts will come this year as a result.  “I tend to think that equities will still rally in that scenario because we’ve already have markets pricing out rate cuts this year. “The really bearish scenario for equities will be if they straight up come out and say, ‘we don’t think there will be any rate cuts this year,’ maybe even start talking about rate hikes. “I think that is really unlikely because that would be incredible whiplash for the markets, but if that were to happen, you would see stocks drop quite significantly if the language was that strong.  “My belief is that we might get a bit of a relief rally … I think they will harden their language but not quite as hard as markets fear.” All 11 industry sectors finished in the red on Wednesday, with the energy sector leading the battered market with a near two per cent fall.  The sector is down as oil prices decline on renewed prospects of a ceasefire in the Middle East, with brent crude trading near US$85 per barrel. Energy giant Woodside tumbled 2.48 per cent to close at $27.53 a share while South Australian producer Santos slumped 2.01 per cent to end at $7.54. Petroleum refiner and retailer Ampol extended its 3.34 per cent fall from Tuesday, shedding another 3.64 per cent to finish at $35.47.  The big banks struggled through the day, though NAB eked out a 0.08 per cent gain to end at $33.83 a share.  Commonwealth Bank fell 0.54 per cent to $113.92 while ANZ slipped 0.28 per cent to $28.08 and Westpac lost 0.69 per cent to close at $25.78.  In corporate news, national airline Qantas fell 1.19 per cent to $5.83 after reporting an apparent tech glitch that exposed customer data.  The company said there was “no indication” of a cyber security element in the failure. Retail giant Coles lifted 1.11 per cent to $16.40 a share after CLSA and UBS analysts upgraded their outlooks for the company. The top gainer on the ASX200 was uranium miner Paladin Energy, which leapt five per cent to $14.67.  The biggest laggard was coal miner Coronado Global Resources, which tumbled 8.43 per cent to $1.14 after reporting a sharp 19.7 per cent decline in production at its Central Queensland operations from the December to March quarter. The Aussie dollar gained 0.11 per cent against the Greenback to buy US64.8c. International markets continue to help the Aussie sharemarket remain strong ahead of next Tuesday’s federal budget.

Australian shares rebounded to start the week, posting solid gains to claw back some of the heavy losses sustained during Friday’s session, as interest-rate sensitive tech and real estate stocks rallied. The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index advanced 0.8 per cent, or 61.5 points, to close at 7637.4, with all 11 industry sectors finishing in the green. Meanwhile, the broader All Ordinaries fared slightly better, adding 0.9 per cent, to 7906.6.  The Australian dollar was trading at US65.56c against the greenback at 5pm. As traders navigated the path of interest rates in Australia and abroad, NabTrade director of investor behaviour Gemma Dale said equity investors were betting that central bankers “would not break the economy” with a resumption of monetary tightening. “The equity market doesn’t seem to buy an (interest rate) increase,” Ms Dale said. “Economists have certainly pushed out rate cut expectations and we know that cuts aren’t coming anywhere near as soon as everybody was hoping.  “But everyone on the sharemarket side is saying: ‘No, this isn’t happening’.” Interest rate sensitive real estate and tech sectors were the strongest performing, both rising 1.7 per cent.  Goodman Group added 1.2 per cent to $31.19 while Wisetech rallied 1.9 per cent to $92.33. Financials also advanced, with the big four banks all gaining.  CBA added 0.8 per cent to $113.84, while NAB, Westpac and ANZ all climbed 0.3 per cent.  Elsewhere, materials stocks advanced, up 0.5 per cent, with Fortescue adding 0.3 per cent to $25.67 and Rio Tinto rising 0.1 per cent to $130.98. However, sector heavyweight BHP slipped 0.4 per cent to $42.97 amid speculation that it would up its offer to UK-listed mixed miner Anglo American. Energy stocks were the biggest laggards, weighed down by Woodside off 0.3 per cent to $28.19 and Santos, down 0.8 per cent to $7.66. In corporate news, money manager Perpetual advanced 3.1 per cent to $24.02 after it confirmed that it had entered talks with American global investment firm KKR & Co to sell its wealth and trust businesses. Among the top performers was Uranium producer Boss Energy, which vaulted 9.1 per cent to $4.78.  Releasing its March quarter results, the company said it had produced its first barrel at its Honeymoon Project located in South Australia. Battery metals producer Liontown Resources surged eight per cent to $1.21 as it announced its Kathleen Valley project was nearing completion.  The miner expects to deliver the project on budget with production commencing by the middle of the year. Dental chain Pacific Smiles soared 14.7 per cent to $1.87 — its highest since July 2022 — after it recommended shareholders support a takeover from National Dental Care valuing the company at $303m.  Tech sector heavyweight Megaport slipped 1.3 per cent to $14.10 even as it upgraded its EBITDA guidance to between $56m and $58m, up from $51m to $57m. Despite the increase, the results were weaker than analysts had been predicting. Embattled gaming giant Star Entertainment rallied 6.4 per cent to 42c after its chair David Foster quit following revelations uncovered in an inquiry conducted by the NSW Independent Casino Commission.  Mr Foster will be replaced by existing director Anne Ward.  Finally, TPG Telecom added 5.3 per cent to $4.36. The internet service provider signed an agreement with Optus in an attempt to expand its coverage and slash spending.

The Aussie share market has finished strongly on Friday for the third week in a row, as international markets continue to give it a boost.  The ASX200 added 0.35 per cent, or 27.4 points, to 7749 at the closing bell, with the main index gained 1.6 per cent for third consecutive week.  Seven of 11 industry sectors finishing in the green, with energy finishing strong on 1.9 per cent. Beach Energy and Boss Energy both rose 4 per cent. Financials also posted strong gains with 0.7 per cent at the close.  Woodside jumped 2.1 per cent, ANZ jumped 1.4 per cent, Telstra gained 0.7 per cent and CSL rose 1 per cent.

Metals recycler Sims Limited, also lost 7.5 per cent after it issued a profit warning this week.  Shares in Life 360 also dipped 2.5 per cent at the close on Friday, while Light and Wonder lost 6 per cent in response to quarterly earnings. Meanwhile, the broader All Ordinaries also rose 0.4 per cent, closing at 8027.3. CommBank chief economist Craig James said the strong finish to the week was a direct response to international market growth.  “ The local share market got a healthy boost from the US and European share indices today,” Mr James said.  “In fact the 30 stock US Dow Jones index rose for the seventh straight day on Thursday lift 0.9 per cent and the UK market hit another record high.” Looking ahead a s the country grapples with the Reserve Bank of Australia’s decision on Tuesday to hold interest rates at a 12-year high of 4.35 per cent, AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said the real truth about the coming months will all depend on how the federal budget plays out next week.  “The bad news is that the RBA still considers the jobs market as too tight, inflation is falling more slowly than expected, it revised up its inflation forecasts for this year and it actually considered hiking again,” Mr Oliver said.  “In the event, the RBA decided to leave rates on hold on the grounds that rates are restrictive enough, higher rates have impacted households more than in other countries because of a high share of variable rate mortgages and it still sees inflation falling back to the high end of the target range by end next year and to the midpoint by mid-2026.” Mr Oliver said Tuesday’s budget will give an idea on how the RBA will move on rates in the future. “The 2024-25 Australian budget looks like it’s going to be mainly about whether it makes the RBA’s job in fighting inflation easier or harder in the near term and getting ‘Future Made in Australia’ protectionism underway over the medium term,” he said.  “Key things to watch apart from inflation are whether the budget adds extra net stimulus to the economy for the next year, the impact of the 1 July tax cuts on consumer spending and the size of the rise in minimum and award wages in the upcoming Fair Work Commission decision. “We continue to see the RBA leaving rates on hold ahead of rate cuts starting late this year.” Shares in Gold rose 3.9 per cent in response to a higher gold price.

Freshly minted National Australia Bank boss Andrew Irvine has unveiled a double-digit decline in profits in the half year to March but hinted that the ultra-competitive home loan market that was squeezing its margins was starting to ease. In its latest half-year report released on Thursday, cash earnings for the six-months to March fell 12.8 per cent compared with a year earlier, dropping to $3.5bn, and short of consensus forecasts.  The bank, Australia’s second largest, declared an interim dividend of 84c per share, fully franked, and unveiled it would double a share buyback announced last August to $3bn. With NAB the first of among the big four banks to release its half-year profit results, analysts are closely watching the sector for signs that the recent profit squeeze has bottomed out. Net interest margin – a key metric of bank profitability that calculates the difference the bank is earning in interest on loans compared to what it is paying in interest on deposit – was 1.7 per cent – five basis points lower than its previous half-year result. Shares rallied 1.7 per cent to $34.28 following the fresh result. Unveiling a $40m reduction in bad debts across the bank, Mr Irvine, who replaced longstanding NAB chief Ross McEwan last month, said the struggling parts of the economy had been “overemphasised”. “There are large parts of our economy, minerals, mining, agriculture, manufacturing, as you look at supply chains being brought back onshore, closer to customers, defence, healthcare, large portions of the Australian economy doing really, really well,” Mr Irvine said. “They don’t get talked about that much.” However, NAB’s half-year report also reported growing loans arrears, with the bank’s 90-plus days delinquency rate climbing to 0.8 per cent, up 13 basis points from September. Across its Australian home loan business, just 141 properties were in possession.  Mr Irvine said while economic growth was slowing and the increased cost of living was being felt by more households, the majority of NAB’s customers were managing the heightened pressures. “They’re not enjoying it, and having to make some tough choices about how they manage their money, but they’re doing OK,” he said. Underpinning the falling half-year earnings was declining profitability in NAB’s personal banking business, down 29.6 per cent in the last 12 months to $553m. Helping to offset the fall was NAB’s business and private banking arm – the institution’s largest division – with cash earnings edging 2.4 per cent lower to $1.7bn.  The bank’s corporate and institutional arm, and its New Zealand segment, also took a hit to their profits, declining 2.8 per cent and 6.7 per cent, respectively.  “Our first-half financial performance has benefited from the disciplined execution of our strategy in a challenging environment,” Mr Irvine said. “This has helped us manage the impacts of slowing economic growth and competitive pressures while also absorbing a higher effective tax rate.” Aussies are about to get a tax cut cash boost and most will ‘spend’ it in a surprising way. Locals are fuming over ANZ’s shock move after the bank posted a profit of more than $7 billion last year. As the Commonwealth Bank boss announced a profit slide, he said one thing was providing a “tailwind” for the Australian economy. "},

The ASX finished strong in the wake of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s decision to keep the cash rate on hold.  The benchmark ASX 200 rose 1.4 per cent, adding 110.9 points to close on Friday at 7793.3 points. The All Ordinaries added 113.2 points or 1.43 per cent higher, closing at 8065.5 on Tuesday.  All 11 industry sectors rose, with utilities seeing the best result at a rise of 2.8 per cent thanks to energy giant AGL. The market confidence followed AGL’s decision to upgrade its earnings guidance for the financial year 2024.  AGL announced it would be lifting its underlying net profit after tax guidance to between $760m and $810m for the year ending June 30. Previous estimates concluded the lift would be $680m to $780m. Meanwhile, AGL also confirmed its underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation are likely to range between $2.12bn and $2.22bn – up from previous estimates of $2.03bn and $2.18bn. AGL finished at the close on Tuesday with a rise of 7.40 per cent.  CommBank chief economist Craig James said the Aussie sharemarket responded well to the Reserve Bank of Australia’s decision to hold interest rates at a 12-year high of 4.35 per cent.  “Overall there was a strong response to the RBA interest rates decision,” he said.  “While the decision was largely as expected, the tone on of the statement was less hawkish. That is now financial markets are suggesting less scope for higher interests,” Mr James said. “The share market was boosted by another rise on Wall St overnight.” BHP was boosted by 1.57 per cent at the close in response to a higher Iron Ore price, according to Mr James.  He said HMC Capital and Ansell, which rose 6.81 per cent and 1.43 per cent respectively, also gained on the back of the announcement both companies were raising their full year profit guidance.  “Shares in Sims Ltd fell 6.4 per cent on a profit warning,” Mr James said.  “Shares in NAB fell 1.5 per cent after the stock traded ex-dividend.” Meanwhile, retail sales fell 0.4 per cent in price adjusted terms in the March quarter, – making it the fifth decline in the last six quarters. CreditorWatch’s Chief Economist Anneke Thompson said the RBA’s decision will have little consideration for the discretionary retail and food and beverage sectors, which “will continue to bear the brunt of tight monetary policy” as consumers cut back on spending in these areas.  “The RBA is no doubt well aware that the cash rate has far less impact on services inflation than it does on goods inflation, and thus a further increase would do little to help move services inflation into the band at a faster pace,” Ms Thompson said.  “It is likely that the next few months’ employment figures will have a key influence on any future cash rate decision that the RBA makes. “Proponents for further tightening of monetary policy point to sticky services inflation as a key reason to increase the cash rate further, while those that refute this argument highlight falling goods inflation and flatlining retail sales as evidence that monetary policy is tight enough.  “The various measures of the labour force data released by the ABS monthly will give the RBA a good yardstick as to which way this argument should fall over the next few months.  “Even moderate softening of the employment market will likely mean that we are at the peak of this tightening cycle, as smaller businesses and many household businesses will now be in precarious financial positions given the high cost of debt.  “The RBA is unlikely to risk further damage to sectors of the economy that are least able to cope with it.” Meanwhile, the banking sector fared well at the close on Tuesday, with Westpac leading with a 2.8 per cent rise. It comes as ANZ announced shares are trading lower after a 7 per cent decline in cash profit at $3.55bn in its first-half yearly results. The big-four bank rose 0.07 per cent at the close on Tuesday hours after the half-yearly results were published.  “This was a strong half on the back of a record result in 2023, profit was down just one per cent on the back of the half,” Mr Elliot said. “The number of customers rose in this half, while still lower than other halves we expect that number to increase.” The bank announced an interim dividend of 83c per share, franked at 65 per cent. The Aussie dollar dipped 0.5 per cent against the Greenback to buy US65.90c. International markets continue to help the Aussie sharemarket remain strong ahead of next Tuesday’s federal budget.

Australian shares dived on Friday in one the largest single session declines of the year, as fears intensified that the Reserve Bank would have to resume its aggressive run of rate hikes. At the closing bell, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index shed 1.4 per cent, or 107.1 points, to close at 7575.9, with all 11 industry sectors finishing in the red.  Across the shortened trading week, the index finished 0.1 per cent higher. The broader All Ordinaries fared slightly better, sliding 1.3 per cent to 7837.4.  The Australian dollar advanced, up 0.3 per cent to buy US65.40c at 5pm.  Following Wednesday’s hotter-than-expected inflation, yields on 10-year Australian government bonds vaulted a further 19 basis points to 4.59 per cent, as traders moved to price out the prospect of rate cuts this year. “The message we are inclined to take from the CPI is be patient. That doesn’t just apply to the economic data flow, but it also applies to the easing cycle,” ANZ chief economist Adam Boyton said. “It is likely to start late this year and will be very mild.” While money markets had ascribed a 70 per cent chance of a rate cut prior to the fresh inflation print, on Friday bond traders tore up their interest rate bets.  Interest rate futures now indicate a 52 per cent chance that the RBA will increase the cash rate to 4.6 per cent at its August meeting.  On the benchmark, industrials were the biggest laggards, falling 2.2 per cent, as sector heavyweight Transurban shed 3.6 per cent to $12.44. Financials also finished sharply lower with all of the big four banks finishing in the red.  CBA shed 1.8 per cent to $112.99, NAB sank 1.4 per cent to $33.51, while Westpac and ANZ were both off 1.9 per cent to $25.69 and $27.99, respectively. Even as Fortescue advanced 3.4 per cent to $25.59 and Rio Tinto added 1.1 per cent to $130.85, the materials sector dropped 1.4 per cent after ASX heavyweight BHP’s made a $60bn takeover offer for Anglo American.  Confirming it had rejected the proposal, Anglo American labelled the bid as “opportunistic” and significantly undervalued the company. BHP’s shares traded down 4.6 per cent to $43.15. In individual stocks, Newmont was the top performer, jumping 13.9 per cent to $65.70, as its March quarter results eclipsed forecasters’ estimates. Shares in Resmed advanced 9.6 per cent to $31.50 after it announced it’s a 29 per cent jump in net profit to $US300.5m ($458m).  The healthcare company’s sales reached $1.1bn in the March quarter, it reported.  Super Retail Group slumped 3.4 per cent to $14.37 after it said it was expecting to defend allegations brought against the company by two employees.

The chief executive of one of Australia’s biggest banks has laid bare the stress the country’s aggressive rate hike cycle has put on homeowners, with the bank’s “customers in hardship” measure doubling in just a year. Westpac chief executive Peter King, in reporting the ASX-listed behemoth’s half-year results on Monday morning, said there had been an “uptick” in stress on its loan books as Australians struggled through higher interest rates and cost-of-living pressures. Thirty-day plus delinquencies from March 2023 to March this year rose from 139 basis points to 181, while customers in hardship had moved from 0.5 per cent of the bank’s mortgage portfolio to 1.05 per cent.  A hardship balance means the bank offers a customer a reduction or deferral of repayments for a short period of time.  Mr King said the bank had about 18,000 assistance packages on its books for struggling customers, up from 11,000 pre-Covid.  “While households have displayed resilience, we know some customers are doing it tough,” he said.  Mr King, speaking with investors, said there were “lots of options available” for struggling homeowners, from debt restructure plans to payment pauses. “I encourage customers to call us if they need help,” he said.  “Call us early would be my key message.” Chief financial officer Michael Rowland also warned that arrears were “likely to rise further” but said the bank’s “credit quality” remained sound.  Westpac has about 21 per cent of Australia’s mortgage market. And in a cautious tone, Mr King delivered a fresh warning to homeowners, warning interest rates would likely stay “higher for longer” as the Reserve Bank navigated sticky inflation and rising geopolitical uncertainty. He said the bank’s economists were forecasting a rate cut in the latter half of the year but he expected it would be “more 2025”.  “Our economics team is forecasting a cut in the fourth quarter. My personal view is I think that’s a bit too early,” he said, citing continued demand in the economy for infrastructure and housing. “We believe the economy is on track for a soft landing and, if this happens, this will be good news for many Australians. “However, this scenario is not certain. “While inflation has fallen, getting it down to target range is proving difficult globally and here in Australia. “It is likely interest rates will stay higher for longer.” A soft landing refers to the outcome where central banks raise interest rates to tame inflation without tipping economies into recession.  Westpac, one of Australia’s “big four” banks alongside NAB, Commonwealth Bank and ANZ, reported its results for the six months to March 31, 2024, with the bank delivering a special dividend of 15c a share fully franked and a $1bn lift in its share buyback program to $2.5bn. The giant recorded a 16 per cent slide in half-year profits to $3.34bn, with Mr King warning of a “slowing economy and competitive banking sector”. The $3.34bn profit figure marks a 16 per cent fall from the corresponding period in the 2023 financial year but a 5 per cent rise from the immediate six months prior. Net interest margin, a key measure of bank profitability, was 1.89 per cent, a fall of five basis points from the prior period.  NIM, expressed as a percentage, calculates the difference between what a bank earns from lending out money from what it pays out in deposits. The bank earnt revenues of $10.81bn for the six months, a 1 per cent decline from the first half of FY23.  Mr King said the bank had “managed growth and margins in a disciplined way amid a slowing economy and competitive banking sector” throughout the half year. “We grew our major Australian segments in a disciplined way with mortgages and deposits up 5 per cent and business lending up 9 per cent over the year,” he said.  “The impact of competition on mortgage margins moderated this half.” The bank has $650.9bn in total deposits, a 4 per cent increase from the first half of FY23, and $784.8bn in total loans, a 5 per cent increase. Mr King delivered a positive view of Australia’s immediate economic outlook. “Overall, the Australian economy is proving resilient,” he said. “While economic growth has slowed, unemployment remains low by historical measures.  But he warned of “potential challenges” to the global economy.  “We are closely watching the ongoing economic risk from geopolitical conflict and uncertainty playing out in the Middle East and Europe.” Shares in the bank lifted 2.63 per cent in morning trading to $27.12 a share. Saxo Asia Pacific Senior Sales Trader Junvum Kim said the bank’s announcement of the special dividend and buyback expansion had been “warmly received” by the market and would likely bolster investor confidence.  “Yet the competitive landscape in the mortgage market continues to be a thorn in Westpac’s side for the core net interest margin, which is struggling to rise above the 2 per cent mark,” he said. Westpac is the second of the big four to report half-year results this month.  Last week, NAB reported a 12 per cent fall in profits to $3.49bn. Aussies are about to get a tax cut cash boost and most will ‘spend’ it in a surprising way. Locals are fuming over ANZ’s shock move after the bank posted a profit of more than $7 billion last year. As the Commonwealth Bank boss announced a profit slide, he said one thing was providing a “tailwind” for the Australian economy. "},

All 11 industry sectors rose, with consumer discretionary gaining the biggest boost at two per cent.  It comes as Wesfarmers — which runs Bunnings, Kmart and Officeworks — rose 2.8 per cent at the close in what was a positive day following it’s annual strategy day on Thursday.  The conglomerate briefly celebrated a new shares record high of $68.68 during Friday’s trade before it finished at the close on $68.31. However, ﻿Block Inc was Friday’s top performer as it rose 9.8 per cent.  The company had recorded the largest gain after its latest quarterly results, adding almost 10 per cent to its share price. Arisocrate also added 2.3 per cent, Goodman increased by 2.7 per cent and Xero rose 1.3 per cent. Property and tech also fared well at the close, increasing by 1.6 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively.  Westpac rose 1.5 per cent ahead of its annual reports on Monday. Macquarie Group was the sole major bank to lose ground in the wake of its disappointing full-year profit, which fell 32 per cent to $3.522bn.  Annual earnings per share was $9.17, down from the prior year’s $13.54.  Chief executive Shemara Wikramanayake said she was taking a “cautious stance” as the group continued to deal with “significant volatility events,” and mounting geopolitical issues. “Macquarie remains well positioned to deliver superior performance in the medium term with its diverse business mix across annuity-style and markets-facing businesses,” Ms Wikramanayake said.

The Australian sharemarket inched higher on Tuesday after a surprise slump in retail sales allayed fears of possible Reserve Bank rate hikes. The benchmark ASX 200 edged up 0.35 per cent, or 26.7 points, to finish at 7664.10, while the broader All Ordinaries index lifted 0.32 per cent, or 25.4 points, to close at 7932. Technology stocks slipped 0.1 per cent to close at 3014.8. March retail sales data from the ABS showed a 0.4 per cent fall in spending across the month, well below economists’ expectations of a 0.2 per cent increase. Consumers spent $151m less in March compared to the month prior, bringing total turnover to $35.7bn. IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said the depressed figures would reduce the probability of rate hikes, which the market had begun to price in following recent hotter-than-expected inflation and job market reports. “The market swung from pricing in rate cuts to pricing in about a 50 per cent chance of a rate hike in September,” he said. “Now that probability has eased to about 25 per cent after that retail sales number so the market is getting pushed back and forward a little bit and that is partly due to the fact the RBA hasn’t been willing to provide forward guidance. “If (Reserve Bank governor) Michele Bullock was thinking about hiking rates after last week’s inflation data, that number today will probably cause her to have second thoughts. “I think the outcome of that means the RBA keeps rates on hold next week. “They may instigate a tightening bias but I really don’t think they want to tighten rates, so that will be front and centre from today’s number.” Eight of 11 industry sectors ended in the green, led by discretionary stocks with a 0.79 per cent gain.  Industrials, utilities and IT stocks booked losses, led by industrials with a 0.53 per cent fall.  The Aussie dollar lost 0.78 per cent against the greenback to buy US65.1c at the closing bell. The small uplift followed a good session on Wall Street overnight on Monday, which saw the Dow Jones close up 0.38 per cent, the S and P 500 index finish up 0.32 per cent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lift 0.35 per cent.  The big miners posted mixed results, with BHP closing up just 0.14 per cent to finish at $43.03 a share, giving up an intraday rise of some 0.5 per cent. The behemoth announced it had proposed a $39.4bn settlement with the Brazilian government over the 2015 Samarco dam disaster. Rio Tinto fell 0.37 per cent to close at $130.49 while Fortescue jumped 1.48 per cent to finish at $26.05.  The big banks gained ahead of trading updates in early May from NAB, Macquarie, Westpac and ANZ. Commonwealth Bank lifted 0.61 per cent to end at $114.54 a share, Westpac rose 0.78 per cent to close at $25.96, NAB gained 0.54 per cent to end at $33.80 and ANZ edged up 0.32 per cent to finish at $28.16.  In corporate news, lithium miners boomed across the day, with Arcadium Lithium jumping 8.39 per cent to $6.72 a share and IGO lifting 7.33 per cent to $7.91. Azure Minerals leapt 8.21 per cent to $3.69 on FIRB approval of a takeover bid from SH Mining. Petroleum company Ampol fell 3.34 per cent to $36.81 after reporting a 7.3 per cent fall in refinery production for the first quarter of FY24.  Central Queensland thermal coal miner TerraCom slumped 9.26 per cent after reporting lowered quarterly production and sales from its flagship Blair Athol mine.

Australian shares started the week on a positive note, as interest rate sensitive real estate and tech stocks buoyed the benchmark on Monday.  At the closing bell, the S&P/ASX200 index rallied 0.7 per cent, or 53.4 points, to 7682.4, with eight of 11 industry sectors finishing in the green. Meanwhile, the broader All Ordinaries also advanced, climbing by a similar amount to 7952.3.  The Australian dollar was higher against the greenback, climbing to US66.14c at 4pm.  With attention firmly on Tuesday’s interest rate decision and the release of fresh RBA forecasts, RBC Capital Markets chief economist Su-Lin Ong said communications from the central bank would indicate a “very mild tightening bias”. “The RBA will need to see several more months of labour market and inflation data and any change in policy is unlikely for at least three months and probably closer to six months,” Ms Ong said. “An RBA that emphasises patience, downplays recent inflation and labour market data preferring to await more data could temper the more hawkish forecast changes and rate hike discussion.” Economists and investors almost unanimously expect the RBA to keep the official cash rate on hold at 4.35 per cent on Tuesday, with markets ascribing a roughly one in 20 chance of further tightening.  On the benchmark, real estate stocks were the best performing, rallying 1.7 per cent, with sector heavyweight Goodman Group surging 4.1 per cent to $33.98. Stockland added 0.9 per cent to $4.45.  Tech stocks also advanced, up 1 per cent. Wisetech added 2.2 per cent to $94.31 while NextDC jumped 3.1 per cent to $17.04. Heavyweight miners also jumped, tracking gains in iron ore futures on the Singapore exchange which traded above $US119 a tonne. Fortescue led gains, up 2.6 per cent to $26.32, while BHP rose 0.8 per cent to $42.75 and Rio Tinto edged 0.3 per cent higher to $129.68. Financials were led by Westpac, which reported a 16 per cent decline in its first-half net profit as its margins came under intense pressure. Announcing a $1bn increase to its pre-existing share buyback program and a special dividend of 15c apiece, shares traded up 2.7 per cent to $27.12 at the closing bell. Elsewhere in the sector, CBA climbed 1.2 per cent to $116.59, ANZ rose 1 per cent to $28.77 and NAB jumped 0.8 per cent to $34.66. In other corporate news, Qantas shares edged up 0.3 per cent to $5.90. On Monday, the national carrier agreed to pay $120 m in penalties, settling a case that was brought against the airline by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for misleading customers. Unveiling its quarterly results, shares in GrainCorp plunged 3.6 per cent to $8.11 on the back of falling commodity prices and increased competition. The company on Wednesday cut its forecast net profit after tax to between $60 million to $80 m.  Dan Murphy's and BWS parent Endeavour Group jumped 0.2 per cent to $5.24 despite reporting more subdued trading conditions.

Here’s why. Low-cost upstart Bonza airline entered the Australian market with a bang. To celebrate its first flight into the North Queensland city of Mackay, the airline showed off local rugby players wearing purple budgie smugglers and put on purple-themed cocktails. The airline offered Australians in the regions a chance to snatch a holiday to tourist hotspots or see loved ones in under-serviced cities and towns at ultra-low prices. “We are about connecting communities and giving Aussies the chance to fly directly to see loved ones where before it was either too expensive or took too long,” Bonza chief executive Tim Jordan said at the time. But less than 18 months after it first flew up into the skies in January 2023 to take on established behemoths Qantas and Virgin, Bonza is bust, collapsing into administration with thousands of passengers left stranded. Accountancy firm Hall Chadwick is now scrambling to determine whether the low-cost carrier has any kind of future in the country.  So what went wrong? Here are the key factors underpinning the fall. For nearly all of its run, Bonza did not offer ticket purchases through a traditional website, accessed through a Google search.  Instead, the company promoted its Fly Bonza app, with customers booking flights directly through their phone.  Passengers could book flights, manage their bookings, check in and order in-flight food through the app. The app-first approach may have shut out elderly Australians, who are generally not as technologically savvy as younger Australians, and Australian National University aviation guru Dr Zena Assaad said the approach posed serious “visibility issues”. “I don’t know about others but I go onto Google Flights to book my tickets because you can see a comparison of all the different ticket prices and that’s when I choose which provider I am going to go for, which is the cheapest,” she said. “And Bonza isn’t on that. When you go onto Google Flights, Bonza doesn’t come up like that. “If you are going for an app-first approach and you are not on any of these flight comparison websites, which is where most people go to get an idea of flight prices, you are just off everyone’s radar.” Bonza did not compete in the all-important Brisbane-Sydney-Melbourne market or what the aviation industry refers to as Australia’s “Golden Triangle”.  This meant the company lost out on the market’s most concentrated money pot. “The Golden Triangle is so important because this is where most of the action happens and where the money is being made,” Professor Rico Merkert, deputy director at the Institute of Transport and Logistics Studies at the University of Sydney Business School, told NCA NewsWire. “In terms of seats, both Sydney to Melbourne and Sydney to Brisbane are in the top 10 of the busiest routes globally and when measured in revenues generated, Sydney to Melbourne is typically among the top three in the world and was No.1 in 2023 in front of London to New York. “More importantly, having access to these three hubs enables to build domestic and regional feeder networks.” Bonza opted to go for regional routes, often flying direct to new tourist hotspots or linking smaller cities without transiting in a major hub. Dr Assaad said Bonza’s Sydney void may have been a factor in its downfall. “Sydney is the biggest airport across Australia, to the point we now have Western Sydney Airport coming out,” she said.  The business world is tough. Most businesses fail. And Australia’s airline market is brutal. Even the behemoths struggle to survive. Virgin fell into administration in 2020, with US private equity firm Bain Capital bailing it out. During the pandemic, Qantas bled billions. In addition to the standard struggles that confront all airlines, Australia’s domestic market is comparatively small.  In the wake of Bonza’s collapse, Transport Minister Catherine King suggested such a limited market would always present challenges to new entrants. “I think what we’ve got to remember that despite the fact that we are incredible travellers, both domestically and internationally, we are a very small market,” she told the ABC. “And it is a small market in terms of the number of customers available and really in terms of what the market can bear in relation to that. Dr Assaad also said the market was “extremely competitive”.  “We’ve got three major airlines, Qantas, Virgin and Jetstar (a subsidiary of Qantas),” she said.  “Because it is such a small market, we’re not the US or Europe, where we have the capacity that they have or even the airspace that they have and the number of airports that they have. “It’s a small market and it’s a concentrated market and I think it was incredibly hard for them (Bonza) to tap into that.” Bonza operated with just four aircraft.  By contrast, Qantas has more than 100. With such a limited fleet, there is little room for error and timetables can quickly become scrambled.  The low-cost carrier also leased Boeing 737-8s, which are large aircraft that boast 186 seats. Professor Merkert said there may not have been “sufficient demand” to keep the fleet afloat.  “The Bonza story was great from a cost perspective, which was essentially getting super cheap aircraft during the pandemic that were not only cheap from a capital cost but also operating cost perspective,” he said.  “Being brand new, surely, they would be popular with the customers, too, especially at such low fares and being operated at routes that no one else did, which was 84 per cent of their routes. “And sure, Bonza optimised their cost structure to the extreme. “Problem is, this does not guarantee sustained profits. “Those aircraft had 186 seats and those seats want to be filled on as many flights as possible. “I think Bonza did a great job in developing these routes but was likely not quite there in terms of profitability.” Bonza suffered almost immediate reputational damage as flight delays and cancellations piled up.  The airline started flying passengers in January 2023 and by July, customer complaints were already sweeping through social media.  “Don’t how long they will be around,” John Watt said. “First attempt at flying with Bonza(,) cancelled flight up to Sunshine Coast four (hours) before boarding with no options and cancelled the return flight to Melbourne and rescheduled for three day later. “(Their) excuse, staff issues, won’t be booking any more Bonza flights.” Darren Boyes wrote: “Have booked five Bonza flights. And never boarded a single plane. Bye bye Bonza.” Frustrations also mounted over Bonza’s scheduling. “The problem with Bonza is that their primary target market is short-haul domestic travellers, yet they don’t accommodate people who want a weekend away,” customer Sarah Ryan said. “If they changed their flight schedules to Friday evening departures and Sunday afternoon returns they’d see an increase in bookings.” Just months after launching, Bonza chief commercial officer Carly Povey apologised directly to customers and promised to rejig schedules and routes.  “We also know that in the past couple of months, not everyone has had a good experience with Bonza and we need to stare directly into why that is, specifically when we cancel or delay flights,” she said in late July. “We will be implementing a range of changes to our schedule from August 1 based on what we have learnt so far and the feedback you’ve given us with regards to route demand.”  Australians love racking up frequent flyer points and David Boyd, the chief executive of comparison website Credit Card Compare, said the programs offered by Qantas and Virgin acted as a “competitive moat” against new entrants into the airline market. “It’s a moat, it’s a defence,” he said.  “If Bonza had been more successful, maybe they would have got to the point where they could have set up their own frequent flyer program. “If you are sitting on a couple of hundred thousands points, or 50,000 points, and you need to make a trip close to one of those destinations where Bonza was flying to, chances are they (Qantas or Virgin) got more planes going and you can cash in your points. “So I can redeem my points or take a risk with Bonza. “You’re just going to keep falling back into the arms of Qantas and Virgin. “The frequent flyer program is a massive moat.” Rescuers battled freezing temperatures and heavy rainfall as they searched for a lost bushwalker, who was miraculously found uninjured. The bodies of two Perth brothers who were killed on a surfing trip in Baja California have begun their journey home. An Australian man is fighting for life in hospital with a stab wound on the day he was supposed to fly home from a Fijian holiday. "},

The sharemarket notched a ‘tepid bounce’ on Thursday as positive half-year results from NAB lifted the banks and investors digested rates guidance from the US Federal Reserve. The benchmark ASX 200 edged up 0.23 per cent, or 17.1 points, to close at 7,587, while the broader All Ordinaries index lifted 0.22 per cent. Technology stocks crept up 0.12 per cent, or 3.6 points, to 2,972.4. The ASX200 followed a rise in US equity futures, which rebounded following Thursday morning’s update from US Fed chairman Jerome Powell on the trajectory of interest rates in the world’s largest economy. Mr Powell kept rates unchanged and said another rate hike was “unlikely”.  IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said ruling out the “tail risk” of a hike had been well-received by the market.  “The key takeaway there is after the run of hotter inflation data we’ve seen this year, there was starting to be some speculation, not only that rate cuts were being pared back, but that potentially the next move from the Fed could be a tightening,” he said. “But the base case of the Fed is they will need to keep rates higher for longer, but they are not looking to hike rates. “It seemed Mr Powell’s comments were more dovish than the actual statement and that saw US equity futures rebound. “They are trading up about 0.5 per cent and then the ASX200 has followed the lead of those futures markets and that has absolutely given the ASX200 a bit of relief today.”  Six of 11 industry sectors ended in the green, led by IT stocks with a near 1 per cent gain.  Discretionary, energy, utilities, telecommunications and staples all ended in the red, with staples recording a sharp 2.46 per cent fall.  Retail giant Woolworths tumbled 4.15 per cent to $30.50 a share after reporting lacklustre March quarter results.  Sales at the supermarket behemoth’s Australian Food division lifted 1.5 per cent to $12.57bn but CEO Brad Banducci acknowledged the business had struggled through a “challenging quarter”.  Coles fell 1.89 per cent to $16.09. But positive sentiment towards NAB’s half-year results, which showed a $3.49bn profit, lifted the big banks. “The market liked what it saw initially, NAB was up about 4 per cent but it has pared back those gains,” Mr Sycamore said.  “I think the result was generally as the market was looking for.” NAB closed up 1.45 per cent to $34.28 a share, while Commonwealth Bank lifted 0.95 per cent to $115. ANZ rose 0.53 per cent to $28.23 and Westpac lifted nearly 1 per cent to $26.03.  In corporate news, iron ore giant Rio Tinto is keeping mum about any possibility of a play for rival Anglo American after BHP lit up the mining world with its $60bn bid last week.  Rio chairman Dominic Barton, speaking at the company’s AGM in Brisbane, told shareholders he would not “speculate” about mergers and acquisitions.  The top gainer on the ASX200 was digital property exchange business Pexa Group, which soared 11 per cent to $13.58 on the announcement UK bank NatWest would extend its use of Pexa’s platform.

The broader All Ordinaries also advanced on Wednesday, climbing by a similar amount to 8076.7. The increase follows a rally of 1.4 per cent on Tuesday – the index’s strongest performance in three months – after RBA governor Michele Bullock reaffirmed the central bank’s neutral bias, taking some economists by surprise. “After all the volatility in April, the index, supported by the RBA’s reluctance, rightly or wrongly, to seriously consider interest rate hikes, is within touching distance of record high,” Capital.com senior financial market analyst Kyle Rodda said. On the benchmark, tech stocks rose 0.6 per cent. NextDC added 2.2 per cent to $17.46, Wisetech climbed 0.6 per cent to $97.02, and Xero rose 0.4 per cent to $127.59.  Property stocks gained 0.5 per cent even as sector heavyweight Goodman Group trading 0.3 per cent lower to $34.29 after it revealed its portfolio had increased to $80.5bn.  Financials also advanced, up 0.2 per cent, in a mixed session for the big four banks.  While Commonwealth Bank added 0.6 per cent to $119.74 and ANZ jumped 1.2 per cent to $29.12, NAB shares lost 0.5 per cent to $33.96. Westpac traded flat at $27.89.

The Australian share market snapped a five-day winning streak on Thursday as investors sold off financials and consumer discretionary stocks amid renewed concerns over anaemic household consumption.  At the closing bell, the S&P/SASX200 slipped 1.1 per cent, or 82.9 points, to 7721.6, with eight of 11 industry sectors finishing in the red. Meanwhile, the broader All Ordinaries fared slightly better, sliding 1 per cent to 7994.2. The Australian dollar was flat against the greenback, buying US65.77c.  IG Australia market analyst Tony Sycamore said investors were increasingly anxious that inflationary pressures, coupled with a run-down of pandemic-era savings would weigh on consumption.  “There are concerns that when we look at what the RBA is providing in terms of guidance, it doesn’t encourage consumers to go out and spend … that’s coming through in the retail sales data,” Mr Sycamore said. “Households are tightening their budget, savings that they accumulated over Covid-19 are certainly being eaten into.” The ASX followed a mixed session on Wall Street overnight. While the Dow Jones index added 0.4 per cent, extending its longest winning streak of the year, the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 0.2 per cent and the S&P500 was flat. On the local benchmark, consumer discretionary stocks were the biggest laggards, slumping 2.6 per cent, as a series of trading results across the sector heightened investors’ anxieties. Infant supplies retailer Baby Bunting was the worst performer in the sector, tumbled 23.4 per cent to $1.46 after it downgraded its pro forma profit guidance to between $2m and $4m for the current financial year. Sales shed 7.4 per cent in the 12 months to April 30.  Elsewhere in the sector, JB Hi-Fi sank 4.5 per cent to $57.25, Harvey Norman slumped 4.3 per cent to $4.24 and BCF, Supercheap Auto and Rebel Sports parent Super Retail Group fell 5.2 per cent to $13.06 after it unveiled a 5 per cent drop in the sales year-to-date.  Earlier this week, fresh data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed retail volumes fell for the fifth time in the last six quarters as consumers trimmed their discretionary spending.  Financials also experienced a sharp sell-off, down 1.7 per cent, with Commonwealth Bank on Thursday the last of the big four banks to release its latest results which showed profits slid 5 per cent on the previous March quarter to $2.4bn. Shares traded 2.2 per cent lower to $117.09.  In a March quarter update, the nation’s largest lender said that while Australia’s economic fundamentals remained solid, it had experienced a rise in arrears across home, personal and credit card lending.  CBA’s rivals also finished lower, led by Westpac which plunged 5.6 per cent to $26.32, while NAB fell 1.3 per cent to $33.52 and ANZ slipped 1.1 per cent to $28.79. The materials sector also finished lower, down 0.5 per cent. With BHP off 0.7 per cent to $43.06 and Fortescue down 0.9 per cent to $26.41. Rio Tinto was flat at $130.23 apiece. In other corporate news, explosives manufacturer Orica jumped 0.6 per cent to $18.40 after it unveiled a 10 per cent jump in earnings in the six months to March 31. Westfield operator Scentre Group warned shareholders it would hike operating costs following the massacre at its Bondi Junction premises that left six, including one of its security guards, dead. Shares traded 1.9 per cent lower to $3.16. International markets continue to help the Aussie sharemarket remain strong ahead of next Tuesday’s federal budget.

Furious senators have lashed out at Bunnings executives after they couldn’t answer questions about the nature of their supplier agreements following allegations the hardware giant was forcing plant growers into entering unfair contracts.  A nursery manager told a hearing into supermarket power last week the Wesfarmers owned chain made her feel like a “slave” after it pulled out of a supplier purchase at the last minute, costing her business $2.3m in forecast revenue. Bunning’s category manager Belinda Raker told Monday’s hearing the agreements the retailer had with suppliers did not require a set commitment and stressed the business aimed to maintain longstanding relationships with its 250 suppliers. “We have to have really long-term, viable supplier relations here. We also don’t have any exclusive arrangements with suppliers,” Ms Raker told senators.  “Many of our growers have the ability to supply anybody in the market as well, we are not an exclusive retailer for them.” But when the executive could not answer how many suppliers were on minimum order supplier agreements, Nationals senator Ross Caddell lost his cool.  “I’m not hearing a lot of facts – I’m hearing a lot of opinions and clever words,” he exclaimed. “No one has said anything good about Bunning’s in the green life supply. Why is no one coming to us and saying you are good corporate citizens?”  Bunning’s ethical sourcing manager Laura Gaspert argued that the chain worked “incredibly hard” to treat its suppliers with respect. The Bunnings chief executive Michael Schneider did not appear, raising eyebrows. Ms Gaspert says she and Ms Rakers were “best placed” to front the committee. “We work with our suppliers daily, we have interactions with them all the time and more clarity around how Bunnings actually does business with our suppliers,” she said. INDUSTRY INSIDER DETAILS SUPERMARKETS ‘PLAYBOOK ‘ An industry whistleblower has blown the lid open on the shelf pricing tactics supermarket chains are using to the detriment of consumers and to muscle out food suppliers.  Abdel Badoura told Monday’s inquiry into supermarket behaviour that he witnessed “first-hand” Coles and Woolworths’ market manipulation after a decade of sitting in on price negotiations with suppliers. He said the big chains exploited their duopoly to push around suppliers seeking a price increase on their products.  “Coles and Woolworths are running risk-free businesses, they are propped up by suppliers who are paying for the majority of their expenses, with the Australian public being overcharged at every step,” Mr Badoura told senators.  “They have gotten away with this for years due to the lack of competition in the market and their market power abuse.  “As a result, you consistently see high recommended prices compared to other countries on the same products.” Mr Badoura said in his experience, Coles and Woolworths would either  reject or partially accept price increases and then determine a “gap” used to get suppliers to invest more money into their business.  “So in circumstances where a supplier has indicated their costs have increased, the supermarkets then seek to extract more money, ultimately compounding price increases for customers,” he said.  “Third, supermarkets will play games and delay until the last minute, at which they finally align on some form of payment and incremental investment from the supplier in the form of promotions, margins or advertising support. “Because Coles and Woolworths set margin percentage expectations, they know that with every price increase they stand to make millions.” WOOLIES STAFF REVEAL ALL  Supermarket workers have described the escalating rates of violence they have experienced while working for Australia’s two largest supermarkets during a cost-of-living crisis.  Union delegate Josh Reinecker, who has worked for Woolworths for 22 years, told the committee that he had seen acts of violence at his store rise sharply in the past year. He said this had placed heavy stress on staff who were nervous when dealing with customers because they didn’t know what to expect. “We’ve had shop front windows smashed, glass landing near children in prams, we’ve had that same alleged perpetrator come into the store two days later and punch a staff member,” Mr Reinecker told the committee.  “We’ve had an incident where a man wasn’t happy at a checkout, spit on my co-worker, and then there was an altercation with customers.” Mr Reinecker said customers were inciting abuse against staff for many reasons, ranging from the prices of food specials, to the selling of public holiday merchandise.  “I saw someone else recently complain about Anzac Day. That has a flow-on effect to us. They can use it for political gain – but we are the ones who have to cop it,” he told senators. ALLAN FELS SCOFFS AT EMERSON REPORT Former ACCC head Allan Fels told Monday’s hearing that it would be sensible for Australia to adopt divestiture laws similar to the US to reduce harms to consumers and smaller businesses. A separate review on supermarkets rubbished calls for divestiture powers, which would force supermarkets to sell stores if they had too much market share. In his interim report, former Labor minister Craig Emerson argued that divestiture powers would trigger job losses and intensify market concentration.  Professor Fels blasted Dr Craig Emerson’s interim report as “lacking depth” and said deregulation would rather expand markets and employment figures, but said he supported a mandatory code of conduct.  “In Australia we’ve broken up gas and electricity and some other public enterprises and that’s led to an expansion,” he said.  “I was surprised at him (Dr Emerson) commenting on divestiture – I don’t know if he did any study on it whatsoever. He just picked up sort of line one of the standard big retailer response without really going into it with any depth.”  Professor Fels said a separate commission should be set up to investigate rises in grocery prices to allow the competition watchdog to focus on its crackdown on bad business practices.  The ACCC is conducting an inquiry into high supermarket prices and will hand down an interim report in August. Professor Fels argued that an independent commission would encourage a deeper look into the way prices were being determined by the larger chains and push food costs down in the long term.  “It’s better to start with the real problem, the prices, and work backwards to restriction and competition,” he said.  “That links with my idea to have a competition and prices, and perhaps regulation, commissioner because apart from looking at restriction on competition, brought about by government laws and actions, you should also look at the many areas in the private sector where they are questions about pricing behaviour.” RETAIL WORKERS TO TESTIFY Later, the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union will testify after alleging Coles and Woolworths operated in a “duopoly”, or a market dominated by two giant players, and its members have suffered as a result. “They (union supermarket workers) feel the effect of price gouging every day in two critical ways,” the union stated in its submission to the inquiry. “Firstly, they simply cannot afford the food and groceries they sell in their workplaces. “Secondly, they are the public face to irate consumers who exact their disquiet onto workers. “When an aggrieved consumer decides to give a spray to Coles or Woolworths for gouging them at the checkout, it is not the CEO, CFO, hardened executive or managing director who is being abused. “It is a mum, dad, child, sibling, young worker, older worker, poverty wage worker, insecure worker who is facing the brunt of the abuse.” WOOLIES AND COLES TO APPEAR ON TUESDAY Mr Banducci will appear before the committee on Tuesday morning and reject allegations Woolworths has engaged in price gouging practices. “We are part of a highly competitive and innovative grocery sector,” the company said in its submission to the inquiry. “In 2008, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission determined that the industry was ‘workably competitive’ and now it is much more so. “With the arrival of three of the world’s biggest and most competitive retailers (Aldi, Costco and Amazon) in Australia, consumers have even more choice. “Being price competitive is critical in trying to win our customers’ shopping basket.” Woolworths said food inflation had been driven by cost increases “from our supplier partners and cyclical impacts in fresh food markets.” Coles Group will also appear on Tuesday, with the retailer expected to argue grocery price increases have flowed from increasing supplier and input costs. “A key driver of supermarket price increases has been cost price increase requests from our suppliers and farmers,” the company said in its submissions. “Coles received an average of over 70 requests per week from suppliers and farmers in financial year 2022 and financial year 2023, almost double the level of financial year 2021 requests. “Coles is also impacted by the increased cost of doing business with increases in energy, labour, logistics, packaging, interest and tax costs.” Bunnings, a star business of retail conglomerate Wesfarmers, will appear on Monday afternoon and deny allegations it exploits its position in the market to gouge prices. COST OF LIVING DEMANDS Community anger over rising grocery bills has escalated in recent months as shoppers navigate a tightening cost-of-living squeeze.  A Finder survey from February suggested some 42 per cent of households, or an estimated 3.9 million, said their grocery bill was one of their chief financial stressors, a 26 per cent increase, or a bump of 1.5 million new households from just two years ago. Moreover, nearly all Australians are now pursuing strategies to save money at the checkout, with 92 per cent of Australians altering their shopping habits, according to a survey of 1002 respondents.  More than half of shoppers now bulk buy kitchen staples to cut costs and 61 per cent, or some 5.1 million households, visit multiple grocery stores to secure the best prices. The average weekly spend on groceries is now about $188. The issue has stormed to the centre of Australian politics, with Nationals Leader David Littleproud and the Greens flagging the possibility of breaking up the major supermarkets to reduce overall market power. Next to the supermarkets at the centre of the storm, the Senate is also hearing from the Australian Food and Grocery Council, The Australian Dairy Products Federation, the ACCC, the Treasury Department and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry on Monday. A popular soft drink product has been recalled from Coles, Woolies and Dan Murphy’s. Shoppers have described being locked down in Perth’s biggest shopping centre after a terrifying knife incident that left one man with a slash to the face, with two people on the run. A major Aussie retailer has made a green-thumbed move, with an orange twist, that most shoppers are likely to approve of. "},

The Australian sharemarket closed lower on Monday, as investors priced in rising geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East. The benchmark ASX 200 fell 0.46 per cent, or 35.6 points, to end the session at 7752.5, while the broader All Ordinaries index slipped 0.51 per cent, or 40.8 points, to end at 8009.4. Tech stocks suffered a steep 1.42 per cent fall to finish at 2985.3 points.  The Aussie dollar lifted 0.31 per cent to buy US64.8c at the closing bell. Capital.com senior financial market analyst Kyle Rodda said Friday’s sell-off and the weekend’s escalating tensions between Israel and Iran had prompted Monday’s fall. “The inherent issue with the situation in the Middle East is that it is quite difficult to price in the markets,” he said. “And we did see a fairly significant settle off on Friday because we were going into the weekend and we didn’t know what the events would be like and there is kind of a de-risk attitude, reduce your exposure to equities in that environment until you have better clarity over what is occurring.  “The moves today were more or less the market pricing in at the margins a heightened risk of conflict in the Middle East.” Last week’s elevated CPI print in the US has also fuelled fears reserve bankers may hold off on expected interest rate cuts, propelling falls in rate-sensitive equities, but Mr Rodda said geopolitics was the issue of the day. “Effectively, we were just catching up with what markets were pricing in on Friday night,” he said. “From here what investors are looking at is what Israel does and the scale of the response, if there is a retaliation. “That will give a view as to whether this is an ongoing issue or whether this can be put to one side and we can go back to worrying about inflation.” Oil prices are rising on the back on the conflict and Australia’s energy sector lifted in response, finishing the day up 0.38 per cent.  Energy giant Woodside Energy rose 0.36 per cent to finish at $30.31 a share, while Santos lifted 0.9 per cent to close at $7.88. Eight of 11 industry sectors ended in the red, with only energy, materials and staples booking small gains.  Tech stocks led the falls with a sharp 1.75 per cent decline.  Mining stocks Rio Tinto, BHP and Nickel Industries are booked gains following the announcement of new US and UK sanctions on Russian metals. Rio Tinto led with a 3.64 per cent jump to finish at $132.55.  BHP lifted 0.55 per cent to end at $45.77 while Nickel Industries booked a 4.07 per cent rise to close at 90c.  In corporate news, casino operator Star Entertainment slumped almost four per cent to settle at 48c as the troubled gaming business wades through an second inquiry into its flagship Sydney operation. The top gainer on the ASX 200 was Alumina Limited, which jumped six per cent to finish at $1.59, while the biggest laggard was Gold Road Resources, which slumped 6.59 per cent to $1.70.

The Australian sharemarket edged lower on Wednesday, giving up an intraday bounce as investors accepted a “higher for longer” narrative on inflation and interest rates. The benchmark ASX 200 dipped 0.09 per cent, or 6.9 points, to close at 7605.6 points, while the broader All Ordinaries index fell 0.02 per cent, or 1.3 points, to finish the day at 7861 points.  Technology stocks edged up 0.09 per cent, or 2.5 points, to close at 2941.5.  eToro market analyst Josh Gilbert said Wednesday’s flat trading suggested the market was “settling” after Tuesday’s rout, in which the ASX 200 slumped 1.81 per cent and the All Ords fell 1.84 per cent.   “We are really starting to see the ‘higher for longer’ narrative play through,” he said after the closing bell on Wednesday.  “(US Federal Reserve chairman) Jerome Powell came out and stated that last night. “That is one of the reasons we saw that big sell-off from the ASX on Tuesday, essentially wiping out all of the gains for the year. “We have a market here that is very heavily weighted to those rate-sensitive sectors.” Overnight on Tuesday, Mr Powell confirmed reserve bankers had become more cautious about the trajectory of inflation in the US.  “More recent data shows solid growth and continued strength in the labour market, but also a lack of further progress so far this year on returning to our two per cent inflation goal,” he said. A hotter-than-expected retail sales report on Monday and last week’s elevated CPI print has rearranged expectations of rate cuts, leading to falls on Wall Street and the ASX.  “We had such a big sell off on Tuesday, anticipating that this was essentially going to be the case,” Mr Gilbert said. “The market had been expecting that commentary from Jerome Powell and maybe other central bankers to come, given the data we’ve received.” On Wednesday, six of 11 industry sectors ended in the red, with energy stocks booking the largest fall with a 0.49 per cent sector-wide decline.  Utilities, discretionary, IT, staples and telecommunications all booked gains, with utilities recording a 2.84 per cent rise.  The big miners recorded a mixed day, with BHP falling 1.18 per cent to settle at $44.44 a share, Fortescue dipping 0.12 per cent to $25 and Rio Tinto flat with a 0.016 per cent rise to $128.72.  The big banks were also mixed, with Commonwealth Bank closing down 0.23 per cent to $111.94 a share and NAB falling 0.63 per cent to $33.15. Westpac rose 0.12 per cent to $25.58 and ANZ edged up 0.035 per cent to $28.37.  In corporate news, gold stocks recorded impressive gains, with Evolution Mining jumping 7.49 per cent to $4.16 a share after the release of its March quarterly numbers in which the company reported a 15 per cent increase in gold output and a 7.5 per cent jump increase in cash flow to $85m.  Silver Lake Resources and St Barbara lifted 4.01 per cent to $1.42 and 5.66 per cent to 28c, respectively.  Lynas Rare Earths jumped 5.91 per cent to $6.45 on the news mining magnate Gina Rinehart upped her stake in the company to 5.82 per cent.  The federal government’s critical minerals strategy also sparked a boom in Renascor Resources and Alpha HPA. Renascor soared 26.51 per cent to 10c after the government announced it would loan the company $185m to develop the Siviour Graphite project in South Australia. Alpha HPA lifted 6.57 per cent to $1.09 after securing $400m in new government loans to develop a high-purity alumina processing facility in Gladstone, Queensland.

Australian shares followed Wall Street sharply lower on Tuesday after hot US retail sales data pushed traders to scale back their rate cut bets and fears of escalating tensions in the Middle East weighed on markets. All 11 industry sectors finished in the red, driving the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index 1.8 per cent lower, or 140 points down, to 7612.5. The broader All Ordinaries shed a similar amount, plunging 147.1 points to 7862.3.  The Australian dollar also dipped to a five-month low of US64.06c, but recovered from some earlier losses by the closing bell.  Describing the market’s performance as “carnage”, IG Australia market analyst Tony Sycamore said the broad sell-off was the result of a “perfect storm”.  “Stretched positioning across global equity indices, a third successive month of firm US inflation data contributing to unease within a deeply troubled bond market” and “the rising risk of miscalculation and escalation in the Middle East,” were among the factors weight on the benchmark, Mr Sycamore said. Consumer discretionary stocks were the biggest laggards, diving 2.4 per cent.  Wesfarmers shed 2.3 per cent to $65.14, JB Hi-Fi slipped 2.9 per cent to $60.84, while Harvey Norman fell 3.8 per cent to $4.54. Material stocks also dived two per cent, tracking a slump in the iron ore price which sank 2.5 per cent on the Singapore Exchange to $US109.40.  The sell-off came even as fresh growth figures from China, the world’s largest importer of iron ore, showed its economy expanded 5.3 per cent in the year to March, blistering past expectations of a 4.6 per cent increase. Heavyweight miners sank with Rio Tinto off 2.9 per cent to $128.70, Fortescue down 2.8 per cent to $25.03, and BHP sinking 1.8 per cent to $44.97.  Financials were also not spared, with Commonwealth Bank – the nation’s largest retail lender – down 2.1 per cent to $112.44, just ahead of its position at the start of the year. Of the remaining big four banks, Westpac retreated 2.3 per cent to $24.55, NAB sank 1.7 per cent to $33.36 and ANZ was off 2.2 per cent to $28.36. In corporate news, Star Entertainment plunged 14.4 per cent to 42c to be the biggest laggard on the benchmark as a second inquiry into its flagship Sydney casino in just 18 months continued to deliver bad news for the embattled gaming giant.  Suncorp skidded 1.3 per cent to $15.83 after flaws in the bank’s stress test were revealed, leading management to file a prudential breach with APRA, the banking regulator.  Investment and superannuation platform Hub24 slipped 2.1 per cent to $39.8 even as it reported $100bn worth of funds under administration.  After its chief executive Brad Banducci was threatened with jail time over contempt at a Senate inquiry into allegations of price gouging, shares in Woolworths fell 1.2 per cent to $31.88.

A Melbourne tech firm in the midst of investigating where a missing $30mn went has resumed trading from a six-week hiatus to plummet to its lowest share price in 10 years. Cloud-based telco call recording firm Dubber has been rocked in recent months, as its co-founder and chief executive was stood down and then sacked after $30m in a third-party term deposit went missing. The company went into a trading halt in late February at $0.135. The stock resumed trading on Wednesday but closed at $0.061. The drop represents about $42.3m being wiped from the company’s value. Sky News business editor Ross Greenwood called it “one of the worst share price falls in the history of the ASX”. Issues at Dubber emerged when an audit found $30m supposedly being held by Christopher William Legal in a term deposit was missing. Dubber chief executive and co-founder Steve McGovern was then suspended. Last month, Dubber told the ASX that about $3.4m had been recovered, with $26.6m outstanding. “From the investigation conducted to date, it is alleged that Mr McGovern and the trustee were likely involved in the unauthorised use of those funds, including for purposes which were not for the company’s benefit,” the company announced last week as it sacked Mr McGovern. ASIC and Dubber are running their own investigations. The financial regulator sought, and the courts granted, a ban on Mr McGovern and Christopher William Legal principal Mark Madafferi from leaving the country. Mr Madafferi’s legal representatives declined to comment. Mr McGovern’s counsel did not respond. Dubber’s share price had risen about 13 per cent to $0.069 halfway through trading on Thursday.

Australian discount retailer Best and Less is under fire for not signing an international safety accord on factory safety despite indicating it would do so last year on the 10th anniversary of the Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh.  Best and Less sources its product in part from Bangladeshi factories, and the accord, which was sparked by the Rana Plaza tragedy in which more than 1100 garment workers lost their lives in a factory collapse, looks to raise safety standards for workers in South Asia’s garment industry. ActionAid Australia, a women’s rights organisation, claimed the company had moved towards signing the accord but had now backtracked. ActionAid Bangladesh country director Farah Kabir said she was “incredibly disappointed” by the change in heart and claimed it put female garment workers at risk.  “I’ve seen first hand how basic safety measures like smoke alarms and making sure fire exits are clear in factories saves the lives of women garment workers making clothes that Australians wear,” she said. “If all Australian clothing retailers signed up to the accord, it would support a system that secures the safety of all garment workers in factories in Bangladesh. “This would create a level playing field and no retailer would get an advantage by sourcing cheaper garments from unsafe factories. “Best and Less needs to do the right thing and sign the accord for workers so Australian shoppers can be assured the clothes they are buying aren’t putting workers’ lives at risk.” The accord is a legally binding agreement between global fashion brands and trade unions to improve workplace health and safety in the textile industry. ActionAid claims Best and Less continues to source product from factories in Bangladesh that do not meet the accord’s standards.  In the 10 years since Rana Plaza, safety inspectors with the accord had conducted nearly 56,000 inspections across more than 2400 garment factories in Bangladesh, flagging 170,000 health and safety issues, ActionAid said. Best and Less was not involved or connected to the Rana Plaza collapse. Other big retail brands such as Just Jeans, Cotton On, Kmart, Country Road, The Iconic, Witchery, Jay Jays and Big W have signed the accord, along with more than 100 international fashion brands. ActionAid Australia executive director Michelle Higelin said Best and Less’ decision not to sign up to the accord meant the company was “freeloading” on the investments into safety from its competitors. “Other Australian brands like Big W, Cotton On, and Kmart use the same factories as Best and Less, and they are paying for safety improvements as part of their accord obligations. “Effectively, by failing to sign the accord, Best and Less are benefiting from these safety repairs and freeriding off their competitors.” A Best and Less spokeswoman told NCA NewsWire that the company took ethical sourcing “very seriously” and its approach was “consistent with the endeavours of the accord”. “While the accord’s jurisdiction is levelled at Bangladesh and Pakistan, our measures apply across all our suppliers no matter their location,” the spokeswoman said. “Every partner factory is fully audited by a globally recognised third party across several parameters, including environmental, social, ethical and safety. “Our 24-hour worker hotline, which is also operated by a third party, enables factory staff to personally share feedback on conditions of their working experience. “We maintain a stringent ethical sourcing code, release an annual modern slavery report and work collaboratively with our trusted suppliers, which include regular site visits to establish a fair pricing model that also maintains an offering our customers depend on.” The spokeswoman said the company relied on the same audit organisations used by US behemoths Walmart and Disney, including BSCI, QIMA and Sedex.  The company states the majority of its products are produced in China, followed by Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Cambodia. “We ban the use of cotton from Uzbekistan and working with factories in the (Chinese) province of Xinjiang as they don’t comply with our code in human rights,” the company states in its corporate social responsibility statement. Best and Less was formerly an ASX listed company, but BBRC took it over in the middle of 2023. A popular soft drink product has been recalled from Coles, Woolies and Dan Murphy’s. Shoppers have described being locked down in Perth’s biggest shopping centre after a terrifying knife incident that left one man with a slash to the face, with two people on the run. A major Aussie retailer has made a green-thumbed move, with an orange twist, that most shoppers are likely to approve of. "},

Shares advanced on Monday, eking out their strongest gains all month, as healthcare and banking stocks offset a sell-off in energy stocks due to easing tensions in the Middle East.  At the closing bell, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index added 1.1 per cent, or 81.9 points, to reach 7649.2, with all sectors bar energy finishing in the green. The broader All Ordinaries added a similar amount. Energy stocks were off 1.5 per cent at the close of trade with investors increasingly confident that the conflict in the Middle East was “contained”, however, ANZ economists cautioned that the “potential for escalation will keep nerves on edge.” “Simmering geopolitical tensions are likely to mute risk appetite,” the bank’s analysts said in a note to clients.

However, the increase masked a sell-off in gold stocks which slipped as the spot price dipped below $US2360 an ounce.  Bellevue Gold shed 6.9 per cent to $1.81, Regis Resources fell 3.5 per cent to $2.20 and Northern Star sank 1.4 per cent to $15.28. In corporate news, online fashion retailer Cettire shed 6.2 per cent to $2.90 after one of its largest shareholders LHC Capital offloaded its stake in the firm.  Diversified mining and metals producer South32 was the top performer on the benchmark, rising 5.6 per cent to $3.37 even as it withdrew its annual forecast for Australian manganese output following the impact on its operations by Tropical Cyclone Megan. Embattled gaming giant Star Entertainment continued its sell-off, sliding 1.2 per cent to 42c.  Earlier in the session, the company touched the record low of 41c per share as the company’s flagship Sydney operations continued to face an inquiry by the NSW Independent Casino Commission. Uranium miner Boss Energy advanced 3.7 per cent to $4.76 after it reported it had produced its first drum of the commodity at its Honeymoon project in South Australia.

A big change is coming to Woolworths, with the supermarket giant confirming a whole new “dine in” section has been added to 100 stores. The new range is being trialled across NSW and Victoria, with the packaged meals designed to offer shoppers an easy restaurant-style experience from the comfort of home. Some of the offerings include a 1.6kg whole roast chicken dinner with herb roasted potatoes, corn cobs, carrot and pumpkin wedges for $25, or $6.25 per serve, a 1.2kg meat lovers pasta bake for $20, or $5 a serve, a 1.2kg Spanish paella and a 1.6kg chicken parmigiana with mash potato and vegetables.  All of the options were made to cook within 35 minutes and air-fryer friendly, the company said on Tuesday. Woolworths merchandise manager for chilled meals Matt Harbich said the meals were packaged to give customers the feeling of a Friday night at the local pub or Italian restaurant at an affordable price.  “Our Dine In range is intended to cater to busy and budget-conscious customers who are looking for quick and easy meals for their families that both kids and their parents will love,” he said.  “Convenience meals are not new; however, we’ve come very far from the bland microwave dinners of the past. “Pre-made meals are getting tastier and better and we have the benefit of our Woolworths Food Company team and supplier partners being able to create a range of tasty and hearty options for us to bring to market to test and learn based on current food trends. “This allows us to continue to evolve the range based on what our customers want.” The new offering comes as Australia’s rolling cost-of-living squeeze alters eating habits. Woolworths customer research shows 40 per cent of customers are cutting back on eating out or not eating out at all to help save money. And since July 2023, Woolworths states there has been double-digit growth in prepared meals. The range is available at selected stores across NSW and Victoria, though it is expected Woolworths will roll out the section into more stores if it receives positive customer feedback to the trial. Customer feedback would also influence the product range, the company said. A woman has accused cult chocolate brand TimTam of shrinkflation but Arnott’s has clapped back with some home truths.

Shares snapped a five session losing streak on Thursday, even as firmer than expected jobs data affirmed the traders’ view that the Reserve Bank would not cut interest rates until next year. At the closing bell, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 gained 0.5 per cent, or 36.5 points, to reach 7642.1, while the broader All Ordinaries added the same amount to 7898.9. In macroeconomic news, the Australian jobs market shed 6600 positions last month, pushing the unemployment rate to 3.8 per cent, falling short of consensus forecasts of 3.9 per cent. But even as the jobs market showed some weakening, RBC Capital Markets chief economist Su-Lin Ong said it remained “healthy and tight”, and added to the narrative that the RBA would delay rate cuts. “While most of the leading indicators point to labour market moderation ahead, it is possible that the starting point for the labour market is stronger than we thought,” she said. “A patient RBA is likely to stay on the sidelines for some time.” Traders have pushed back their rate cut forecasts in recent weeks amid concerns that inflation could prove more persistent.  Money markets have price out the prospect of any relief this year. Eight of 11 industry sectors finished in the green, with the materials sector adding one per cent as heavyweight miners rallied, tracing an increase in the iron ore price which climbed 1.6 per cent to $US117.25 a tonne on the Singapore Exchange.

Sector heavyweights Woodside and Santos both fell 0.4 per cent, with shares at $29.45 and $7.69, respectively. In individual stocks, Star Entertainment executive chair David Foster temporarily stood down as the chair of Bendigo and Adelaide Bank following allegations he spied on the government appointed manager of Star’s flagship Sydney casino.  Shares in the regional bank added 1.4 per cent to $9.73. Shares in sleep apnoea company ResMed slipped 4.3 per cent to $27.63, following declines by its US counterpart on Wall Street last night.

The value of uranium mining company Boss Energy continues to go nuclear, with the miner jumping three per cent in trading on Monday after announcing its first production of yellowcake from the recommissioned Honeymoon project in remote South Australia.  The jump has pushed the market capitalisation of Boss to almost $2bn from just $37m in 2015, when the company took on the abandoned mine site about 400km northeast of Adelaide. Production at the mine is expected to ramp up to 2.45 million pounds of uranium for export each year from a total resource 71.6 million pounds and comes as global uranium prices surge, moving from about $77 per pound in January 2023 to about $140 per pound this week.  Boss managing director Duncan Craib said the milestone showed “conclusively” the company’s mining and processing strategy was working.  “This is pivotal because it paves the way for strong organic production growth by unlocking the value of our large resource and leveraging the infrastructure we have in place,” he said on Monday. “We have also made extensive provision in the Honeymoon plant for increased throughput. “Increased utilisation of these highly valuable assets will enable us to further capitalise on the strong outlook for the uranium price.” Uranium is used as an fuel for nuclear power generation. Nuclear energy is a low carbon power source and governments around the world are looking more closely at the energy option to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and hit net zero targets. Australia does not have domestic nuclear power and so miners export abroad.  Boss holds a uranium mineral export license for 3.3 million pounds per year and in December, it announced a binding sales contract to supply uranium to an unnamed US power company. Boss will sell a million pounds of uranium to the public utility over a seven-year period, commencing in 2025.  The agreement is based on market-related pricing with a ceiling and floor price that is above Boss’ forecast production costs at Honeymoon, the company stated at the time. The company is also pursuing growth outside of Australia. In February, Boss announced the acquisition of a 30 per cent stake in the Alta Mesa uranium project in South Texas for about $90m, which Mr Craib said would grow the company’s inventory, production and cashflow in “tier-one locations”. “The Alta Mesa project has many key similarities to our Honeymoon project in South Australia, where the commissioning process is well on track,” he said. “Alta Mesa will also enable us to diversify our production on both a project and geographical basis. “Our strong production and growth outlook is underpinned by a robust balance sheet with no debt and a strategic uranium stockpile now worth US$195m ($302m) based on current spot prices.” South Australian Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis said Honeymoon’s restart demonstrated the “significant potential” for long-term uranium production and expansion in the state. “South Australia hosts 23 per cent of the world’s uranium resource but only accounts for 10 per cent of the world’s uranium production,” he said.  “There is significant potential for long term production and expansion in South Australia and with the price of uranium booming, there is no shortage of demand.” Stock in Boss was trading at $4.74 per share on Monday afternoon.  Health and workers’ rights advocates are pushing ministers to curtail asbestos, warning it could linger into the next century despite being banned in 2003. The Aussie sharemarket has remained strong in the wake of a less than ‘hawkish’ interest rates decision by the Reserve Bank of Australia. Ahead of the central bank’s impending interest rate decisions, investors on the Australian share market were in an upbeat mood. "},

Australian shares finished flat on Wednesday after firmer-than-expected quarterly inflation figures prompted traders to slash their bets that the Reserve Bank would deliver rate cuts this year.  At the closing bell, the benchmark S&P index was just 0.5 points off to 7683, while the broader All Ordinaries inched 0.4 points lower to 7937.5. Even as the share market climbed early in the session, the benchmark erased all its gains after the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that inflation accelerated to one per cent in the March quarter, outpacing economists’ expectations of a 0.8 per cent increase. Following the release, money markets ascribed just a 19 per cent chance the RBA would deliver a rate cut at its final meeting this year, scheduled for December.  On Tuesday, interest rate futures inferred an 80 per cent chance of a cut. Economists at Citi, Westpac, UBS, AMP and RBC Capital Markets all deferred their rate cut forecasts following the CPI reading. Jettisoning her forecast for a rate cut in September, Westpac chief economist Luci Ellis said the fresh inflation data was indicative of the “slow grind” in disinflation. “Given the slower progress on disinflation this quarter and the lower starting point for labour market slack, we now expect the first rate cut to occur after the November meeting,” Dr Ellis said. The Australian Dollar pushed higher against the greenback, peaking at US65.25c.  Meanwhile, yields on three-year Australian government bonds vaulted 11 basis points to 4.04 per cent — the highest this year. On the benchmark, seven of 11 industry sectors finished in the red, with utilities stocks the biggest laggard, down 0.6 per cent. Interest rate sensitive tech and real estate stocks also slipped, down 0.4 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively.  As the iron ore price traded above $US118 per tonne on the Singapore exchange, heavyweight miners were mixed.  While BHP slipped 0.6 per cent to $45.23 and Rio Tinto sank 0.2 per cent to $129.38, Fortescue climbed 0.7 per cent to $24.76 even as it reported lower shipments of the key steelmaking ingredient quarter-on-quarter, below analyst forecasts.

Australian shares advanced on Tuesday as investors awaited fresh inflation data for clues on whether the Reserve Bank could deliver rate cuts this year. The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index added 0.5 per cent, or 34.3 points, to 7683.5 points, while the broader All Ordinaries rose a similar amount to 7937.9.  Of the 11 industry sectors, all finished in the green bar energy, materials and industrials.  Ahead of the fresh inflation figures, EightCap market analyst Zoran Kresovic said traders would be closely watching for indications on the path of rate cuts. “The concern for the market is because inflation is running so high locally, unemployment is very low and wages growth is substantial, we might not get interest rate cuts in Australia at all this year,” Mr Kresovic said. “If that is the case, then obviously the market will need to reprice itself.” According to consensus forecasts, the consumer price index is expected to accelerate to 0.8 per cent in the March quarter, up from 0.6 per cent in December.  This would take the headline inflation rate to 3.5 per cent in the year to March, down from an annual reading of 4.1 per cent recorded in December. Traders have priced out the chance of rate cut by the RBA this year, with investors instead expecting a 25 basis point cut in early 2025. Following a rally on the Nasdaq, tech stocks were the top performers, rising 1.7 per cent.  Wisetech jumped 2.7 per cent to $91.60 and Xero climbed 1.6 per cent to $121.57.

The Australian sharemarket dropped as the week came to its final close, after investors acted cautiously in the wake of reports Israel launched an attack on Iran.  At the closing bell on Friday, the benchmark ASX 200 dropped one per cent, or 75 points, to reach 7567. The broader All Ordinaries dropped to 7817.4. CommSec stated the global tensions had a direct result on the Aussie sharemarket.  “Local shares posted sharp declines on Friday amidst geopolitical tensions,” CommSec said.  “Aussie shares fell on Friday as geopolitical concerns and uncertainty over the US interest rate cut timeline kept investors cautious.” Multiple news agencies overseas reported on Friday that Israel had launched a strike on Iran. The ongoing conflict comes days after Iran launched strikes on Israel in retaliation for Israel targeting an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria. All 11 industry sectors fell at the close, with tech dropping 1.6 per cent and property down 1.5 per cent.  The lowest performing stocks in the index were Polynovo and Karoon Energy, down 5.58 per cent and 5.41 per cent respectively. On the other end, Northern Star saw a boost of 1.3 per cent and Santos jumped 1.8 per cent at the close, as investors favoured buying gold and government bonds in the wake of escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. The Index lost 2.84 per cent over the past five days, but remains mostly over the last year to date. Friday’s close is the index’s lowest level in almost three months. However, the ASX was heading towards 2.9 per cent on early Friday, which would have seen it be the worst week since early September 2022, according to CommSec.  Meanwhile, Macquarie Bank was ordered to pay $10m by the Federal Court for failing to implement effective controls to protect its customers from fraud between May 2016 and January 2020. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission successfully won its case against Macquarie after arguing the bank had failed to stop unauthorised fee transactions conducted by third parties, such as financial advisers, on customer cash management accounts using Macquarie’s bulk transacting facility. The legal action came after former financial adviser Ross Hopkins was convicted of 15 counts of dishonesty and sentenced to six years in prison in 2021.  “Fraud controls are increasingly important and this case sends an important message to financial institutions and other financial service licensees that they must have appropriate controls in place,” ASIC chair Joe Longo said. “While Macquarie implemented effective controls from January 2020, its earlier failures meant that financial adviser Ross Hopkins was able to fraudulently withdraw around $2.9m from his customers’ accounts without being detected by Macquarie. “ASIC expects financial institutions to prioritise and invest in systems that protect their customers.  “Macquarie fell short of its obligation to do all things necessary to provide its financial services efficiently, honestly and fairly and as a result it has become liable for a substantial penalty.” Macquarie Bank acknowledged the Federal Banks’ decision on Friday, explaining the bank had worked to reimburse the 13 clients affected Hopkins’ actions.  “The financial adviser, who was not a Macquarie employee, pleaded guilty to fraud and was convicted in 2021,” the bank stated.  “Following his failure to compensate the clients for their losses, Macquarie took the decision to fully reimburse the 13 clients. “Macquarie acknowledges that it had contravened a statutory obligation in connection with the controls to monitor bulk transactions made under third party fee authorities on the CMA.” In 2020, Macquarie introduced new controls and processes for third party fee authorities on the CMA to address the issue. The Australian dollar fell 0.2 per cent to finish at 64US cents.  International markets continue to help the Aussie sharemarket remain strong ahead of next Tuesday’s federal budget.

A majority of Australians will use their impending Stage 3 tax cut to save money or beat back cost-of-living pressures rather than splurge on one-off items, a new survey shows. From July 1, Australians will pocket between $350 and $4500 in extra cash each year depending on their income bracket as part of the tax cut package. Banking behemoth NAB estimates more than a third, or 36 per cent, plan to save extra money rather than splurging on non-essentials.  A majority of Gen Z Australians, or 53 per cent, will save rather than spend and 49 per cent of those earning between $100,000 and $150,000 will likely choose frugality over extravagance, the bank’s data shows.  Some 29 per cent plan to beat back higher living costs with the cash boost while 22 per cent will use it to pay down debt. One in three Australians are saving for a holiday or adding to a rainy-day fund, while one in four are saving for a home and one in five for retirement.  Almost eight in 10 said they were trying to save more money and on average, Australians are looking to get to about $17,000 in savings.  NAB personal banking executive Paul Riley said the plan to save rather than spend Stage 3 would help in the “fight against inflation”.  “Despite cost-of-living pressures, Australians have been prioritising their savings wherever possible over the last year or so,” he said. “The money people expect to get back from stage 3 tax cuts will help supercharge their savings or rainy-day funds. “Three quarters of NAB deposit and savings accounts are now opened digitally and household deposits have grown by 6.4 per cent over the last year. “High interest savings accounts can be a safe, smart and stable way to manage your money, providing ready access to funds if they’re needed, as well as a rewarding interest rate. “Many Australians are also keen to use the money from these tax cuts to give their household budgets, which are under pressure from the cost-of-living crunch, some much-needed breathing room. “Fewer Australians are planning to splurge their tax cuts, which is welcome news in the fight against inflation.” The data is sourced from the bank’s Q1 Australian wellbeing survey of 2000 Australians.  Labor will pour billions more into building new homes in a move welcomed by the housing sector, but slammed by its political opponents. Treasurer Jim Chalmers has flagged measures to encourage Australians to have more babies will be included in next Tuesday’s federal budget.

Australian shares slipped over Friday’s session, as a broad sell-off in consumer stocks, materials, financials and energy stocks weighed on the benchmark.  At the closing bell, the S&P/ASX200 shed 0.3 per cent, or 25.5 points, to 7788.1, as eight of 11 industry sectors finished in the red. Despite the sell-off, shares eked out modest gains over the week to finish 0.2 per cent higher. Meanwhile the broader All Ordinaries shed 0.3 per cent of its value over Friday’s session. Against the greenback, the Australian dollar was buying US65.23c at 4pm. While the local benchmark struggled to gain momentum, Wall Street rebounded overnight as cooler-than-expected producer prices followed Wednesday’s inflation-induced sell-off. On Wall Street, tech stocks led the rally, with the Nasdaq climbing 272 points or 1.7 per cent to hit a fresh record. The S&P500 added 0.7 per cent while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed just 2 points, or less than 0.1 per cent. Even as traders slashed their rate cuts bets following the hotter-than expected CPI reading, ANZ chief economist Adam Boyton said he doubted there were significant implications for the Reserve Bank. “We don’t think there are too many local conclusions to draw from this, although the persistence of US inflation is a reminder that Australia’s path to within‑target inflation is unlikely to be linear,” Mr Boyton said. “As a result, we think it will be some time before the first RBA easing.” On the benchmark, consumer staples were the biggest laggards, falling 0.9 per cent, as sector heavyweights Coles shed 1.2 per cent to $16.15 and Woolworths dipped 1.1 per cent to $32.22.  The financials and materials sectors also fell, losing 0.2 per cent and 0.4 per cent, respectively. Meanwhile, utilities stocks were the top performers, adding 1.3 per cent, as sector heavyweight Origin Energy advanced 2.3 per cent to $9.76.

Online luxury fashion retailer Cettire shed 6.9 per cent to $3.12 even as it reported an 88 per cent increase in sales for the March quarter to $191m compared with the same period a year earlier. Shares in Domino’s Pizza slipped 7.5 per cent to $40.17 as Don Meij, chief executive of the struggling fast food chain, told investors he planned to expand store numbers in Japan to 2000, up from its current level of 1015. Building products manufacturer Boral rose 1.5 per cent to $6.12 after the company recommended a takeover bid worth $1.5bn from its largest shareholder, the Kerry Stokes-controlled Seven Group.

Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, slipped below $US90 a barrel, after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said some IDF troops had been withdrawn from southern Gaza.  On the ASX, Woodside Energy slipped 1.6 per cent to $30.10, while Santos shed 1 per cent to $7.85. Meanwhile, tech stocks were the best performers, jumping 1 per cent.

Oil and gas producer Beach Energy plunged 15 per cent to $1.61 after it warned that gas wouldn’t flow at its WA-based Waitsia LNG facility until early 2025, with project cost set to blowout by an additional $200 million.

Australian shares extended their winning streak on Wednesday, as iron miners rallied on an improved outlook for the key steel making ingredient. The benchmark index, the S&P/ASX200, added 0.3 per cent, or 24.3 points, to reach 7848.5 points. Eight of 11 industry sectors finished in the green. The broader All Ordinaries had a stronger showing, climbing 0.4 per cent. The Australian dollar slipped against the greenback, buying US66.23c at the closing bell.  All eyes were on US inflation data, scheduled for release at 10.30pm AEST, with traders watching to see if the recent run of hotter-than-expected consumer prices continues. Evidence that inflation is proving more stubborn than originally anticipated will likely reinforce doubts that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates as quickly or as deeply this year as it has previously indicated.  “We’ve had two hot CPI numbers, we cannot afford a third one,” IG Australia market analyst Tony Sycamore said. “My gut feel is we are going to get a better number or a number in line with expectations … I think that’s enough to keep in place expectations of Fed rate cuts and keep the uptrend in place for US stock markets. “But if we get another hot number tonight then US equity markets are not going to like it and the bond market will be particularly unhappy.” Tracking gains in the iron ore price, which traded on the Singapore Exchange at $US106.75 per tonne on a brighter outlook for consumption, Rio Tinto added 1.9 per cent to $127.75 as it announced it would invest $14.4m in start-up accelerator Founders Factory.

Australia’s largest gold and silver mint is celebrating its 125th anniversary with the release of five special coins, each imprinted with an image of King Charles III and one with an extremely limited mintage of just 500.  The Perth Mint will release two pure gold coins, two pure silver coins and a coin of pure platinum, all with King Charles on one side and a P125 mintmark on the other. The coins also feature a kangaroo, koala and kookaburra. The mint, which is wholly owned by the West Australian government, serves as a gold refiner and manufacturer, and delivers premium precious metals products to markets around the world. It opened its doors for the first time on June 20, 1899 as a branch of Britain’s Royal Mint at the height of WA’s gold rush, the mint’s website states, and remains Australia’s oldest operating mint. Perth Mint chief executive Paul Graham said the anniversary coins reflected the mint’s “richness” of craftsmanship. “We are proud to be releasing these 125th anniversary coins to allow Western Australians and the broader public to join us in celebrating this unique and tradition-rich organisation,” he said. “Throughout the ups and downs of the gold cycle and the evolution of the Mint over the past 125 years, we have maintained an unwavering focus on supporting the gold mining sector and producing high quality precious metals coins and minted products.” The five coins are:  A man is now in custody after a major shopping centre was locked down when a knife fight broke out.

Supermarket giant Woolworths will put money into a $190m global investment fund to keep its stores at the forefront of emerging retail technology and address sustainability challenges in the sector. The venture capital fund, called W23 Global, will seek out early-stage start-up companies that are using tech to drive faster, more personalised and connected shopping experiences and create more efficient grocery value chains, chief investment officer Ingrid Maes said on Tuesday.  “It’s about identifying problems that need solving and opportunities to create better experiences for customers and partners, and thinking about technology solutions to do that, seeing if there are existing technologies and ideas that could be supported to develop more quickly,” she told NCA NewsWire. “It’s also about going to the start-up community and saying, ‘come up with new ideas that solve for the challenges we’ve identified, create a business around them and we will invest to help you make your vision a reality’.” Woolworths is backing the fund alongside leading global retailers Ahold Delhaize, Tesco, Empire and Shoprite.  “W23 is a potentially game-changing international VC fund with a powerful proposition for both our investors and portfolio companies,” Ms Maes said in a separate release. “We aim to offer our investors incomparable access to transformative innovation in grocery and sustainability worldwide … with leading grocery CEOs on our investment committee, founders can rapidly develop ideas based on an accelerated understanding of retailers’ needs.” Challenges identified by the fund include emissions and waste reduction, packaging innovation and product traceability and transparency. Each retailer will put US$25m and the company CEOs will sit on the investment committee. The fund, which will deploy the money over five years, will be based in the United Kingdom.  Venture capital funds invest in start-up companies to push emerging tech from ideation and infancy through to maturity.  Ahold Delhaize CEO Frans Muller, speaking from the Netherlands, said the fund would help deliver “greater value” to communities worldwide. “We look forward to enhancing our efforts by partnering with other industry leaders and maximising our collective impact,” he said. “Together with best-in-class start-ups and scale-ups, we strongly believe we can further drive retail innovation, foster sustainability and deliver greater value to communities worldwide. Ms Maes currently leads Woolworths’ corporate VC fund, W23 Australia. The companies W23 Global invests in will be free to trade with other customers separate from the five retailers. For the half-year ended December 31, 2023, Woolworths Group posted a 4.4 per cent increase in revenues to $34.6bn compared to the same period in 2022, with its Australian Food division contributing $25.9bn to the figure, a 5.4 per cent increase. But the company swung to a $781m loss following a writedown in the value of its New Zealand business and a fall in the value of its stake in ASX-listed Endeavour Group. Without the impairments, Woolworths would have booked a $929m profit, or a 2.5 per cent increase from the corresponding period. The company’s share price is down nearly 14 per cent year-to-date to sit at $32.33 on Tuesday midday. A popular soft drink product has been recalled from Coles, Woolies and Dan Murphy’s. Shoppers have described being locked down in Perth’s biggest shopping centre after a terrifying knife incident that left one man with a slash to the face, with two people on the run.

Stocks sank on Wall Street after fresh US inflation data came in hotter-than-expected for the third consecutive month, sparking fears that the Fed Reserve won’t cut rates anytime soon. Following the surprise result, traders pulled back their rate cut betters, with the Fed now fully priced for a cut in November, while money markets ascribe 91 per cent chance that the Reserve Bank will deliver a 25 basis point cut at its December meeting.  “From the Fed’s perspective, it certainly provided them with no confidence that inflation is moving towards (their target of) two per cent in a sustained way for them to be able to initiate an easing cycle,” Perpetual’s head of investment Matt Sherwood said. Mr Sherwood added he would be “shocked” should the RBA move to cut rates ahead of the Fed, and was sceptical of any easing at all this year. “Wages growth is still accelerating, the cash rate is lower to begin with, and let’s not forget the fact that everyone’s getting very, very substantial tax cuts in July,” he added.

The union originally pushed for a yearly 8 per cent bump in pay over three years, with Transgrid offering a 13 per cent wages and superannuation offer. But last week, the union said it tabled a “compromise” offer for a 6.5 per cent increase each year for three years plus a 0.5 per cent superannuation increase in years two and three. Transgrid has not accepted the offer, but a spokeswoman told NCA NewsWire the company had also moved from its original position. “Transgrid’s competitive wage and superannuation offer is 14 per cent over three years, with a 5 per cent wage increase in the first year, a 4 per cent wage plus 0.5 per cent superannuation increase in the second year and a further 4 per cent wage plus a further 0.5 per cent superannuation increase in the third year as part of an overall package, compared to the December Transgrid 13 per cent wages and superannuation offer,” she said.  “In terms of broader economic considerations, our wages offer exceeds the rate of expected inflation over the life of the proposed enterprise agreement. “Our wages offer and other benefits proposed for the enterprise agreement takes account of several factors including the competitiveness of our current employment conditions and how we compare to others in our industry.” ETU NSW and ACT Secretary Allen Hicks said the company was behaving in a “pig-headed” manner and claimed its alleged recalcitrance put Australia’s net zero ambitions at risk. “Our electrical workers are invaluable, they often work nights and weekends away from their families to get the community’s power back on quickly, and they are the key to unlocking billions of dollars worth of renewable energy generation,” he said on Friday. “Yet in the midst of a national energy transition and skills shortage, Transgrid’s stubborn refusal to lift wages threatens to further gut the essential workforce and undermine the transition to net zero.  “Transgrid has the funds but doesn’t have the will to pay electrical workers what they are worth.” In January, the union alleges 83 per cent of eligible Transgrid employees rejected the company’s proposed enterprise bargaining agreement. Some workers will also rally outside the company’s depot in western Sydney. The union claims its industrial action will not endanger the general public or workers. “Resources will be available to respond to life-threatening emergencies,” the union said.  The rolling strikes have hit the company’s signature EnergyConnect project, a $2.3bn transmission line build that is expected to feed more green energy into the grid. The interconnector will connect power grids in South Australia and NSW and the Australian Energy Market Operator has deemed it a “required project” to fortify Australia’s eastern energy market. The rolling strike action at Transgrid comes as the federal government moves to underwrite 32GW of new renewable energy generation to hit an ambitious 82 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2030. Labor will pour billions more into building new homes in a move welcomed by the housing sector, but slammed by its political opponents. Treasurer Jim Chalmers has flagged measures to encourage Australians to have more babies will be included in next Tuesday’s federal budget. Aussies are about to get a tax cut cash boost and most will ‘spend’ it in a surprising way. "},

As explosive house price growth continues to burn through Australia’s major cities, a shrewd new trend is taking hold that allows home buyers to get their foot on the property ladder without sacrificing an up-market lifestyle. Called ‘Rentvesting’, it’s the strategy to buy a property in a comparatively affordable suburb but then live in a rental in a more desirable area. According to Dr Michael Baumann, executive general manager of home buying at Commonwealth Bank, more and more Australians are pursuing the ploy, with a surprising group becoming the most active on the scene. “Interestingly, what we continue to see from many Aussies is the inclination to ‘rentvest’, buying property where they can afford and then renting where they wish to live,” he said. “Rentvesting gives Australians the chance to get their foot on the property ladder sooner rather than later and purchase a property in a lower cost area without having to give up the lifestyle they have become accustomed to when renting.” Data from CommBank, Australia’s largest bank, also shows Millennials are now the most “active” generation in buying investment properties, with 46 per cent of the bank’s new property investors in 2023 made up of Australians born between 1981 and 1996.  Gen X, or those born between 1965 and 1980, accounted for 37 per cent of all new investment property purchases.  The average age of a property investor was 43 years and the average loan size was just over $500,000, the bank’s data shows. Dr Baumann said a “significant portion” of Millennial investors were also buying properties on their own. “We can see that almost one third of all millennial property investors actually purchased their investment property on their own,” he said. The top postcodes for new property investment purchases in 2023 were 2000, which is the Sydney CBD including Haymarket, 3029, which takes in West Melbourne including Hoppers Crossing, 2765, which is North West Sydney including Marsden Park, 3064, which encompasses North Melbourne including Craigieburn and 2155, which takes in North West Sydney including Kellyville. With the cost of living biting millions of Aussies, there are some smart tricks around to make yourself some serious cash. Powerball’s $100m jackpot has topped a surprising landmark in Australian history after no Division 1 winners were announced in Thursday’s draw. The man behind a collapsed sports betting business has disappeared, leaving investors fearing they are victims of a Ponzi scheme. "},

Australian shares finished the week in negative territory after the benchmark lost further ground on Friday due to a sell off in tech and material stocks. The benchmark index, the S&P/ASX200, slipped 0.6 per cent to 7773.3 at the closing bell, with all 11 industry sectors sinking into the red. The broader All Ordinaries similarly shed 0.6 per cent.  The Australian dollar lost 0.2 per cent of its value against the greenback to trade at US65.74c. With the benchmark falling 1.6 per cent over the shortened trading week, investors have been skittish after receiving conflicting economic data and mixed signals from US central bankers on the path of rate cuts. Overnight on Wall Street, all three major indices finished in the red after Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari warned that if progress on inflation stalled there was a “possibility” of no rate cuts this year. CommSec market analyst Steven Daghlian said expectations regarding rate cuts were “changing on an almost daily basis” at a time when equities were nearing “dizzying heights”.  “It gets easy to rattle markets when there’s either commentary from Fed officials pushing out the first rate cut possibility, or when there’s data that’s disappointing as well,” Mr Daghlian said. “That’s probably going to continue for the time being.” Fresh jobs and inflation data out of the United States would provide traders with further clues on the path of interest rates, Mr Daghlian added. Locally, interest rate sensitive tech stocks were the biggest laggards, skidding 1.4 per cent, as Wisetech and Xero both sank 1.7 per cent to $90.87 and $123.00, respectively. On the Singapore Exchange, iron ore futures slid 0.8 per cent to $US96.95 per tonne for the May contract, with miners for the key steelmaking tracking lower. BHP shed 0.9 per cent to $44.35, Rio Tinto slipped one per cent to $120.55, while Fortescue fell 0.7 per cent to $24.78. Meanwhile, the energy sector was the best performer, unchanged through Friday’s session, as Brent crude futures traded at $US91 per barrel amid fears of a re-escalation of tensions in the Middle East. “Oil prices look set for further upside in the short term as a more positive economic backdrop is joined by ongoing supply tightness and rising geopolitical risks,” ANZ economists said in a note to clients.  The bank’s commodity analysts have upped their short-term target for the oil benchmark to $US95 per barrel. Sector heavyweights Santos added 0.6 per cent to $7.93 while Ampol rallied 0.9 per cent to $41.28. In company news, shares in St Barbara vaulted 7.9 per cent to 21c after the gold miner reported production of 17,257 ounces of the precious metal in the March quarter, up 33 per cent on the December quarter. Meanwhile, fellow gold miner Capricorn Metals reported production at its Karlawinda facility of 26,017 ounces for the March quarter, with output affected by the impact of rain at its open pit mine. Shares traded 5.5 per cent lower to $5.19.  Embattled money manager Magellan Financial fell after it reported net outflows of $700m in March, even as total funds under management rose to $37.3bn. Shares sank 3.7 per cent to $9.49. International assets manager GQG Partners jumped 4.1 per cent to $2.29 as it conversely reported net inflows of $US4.6bn over the March quarter, with total funds under management reaching $US143.3bn. Human services firm APM extended its trading halt having received a letter of intention from its largest shareholder, Madison Dearborn Capital Partners, regarding a proposed takeover bid. Shares last traded at $1.63. International markets continue to help the Aussie sharemarket remain strong ahead of next Tuesday’s federal budget.

A bounce in real estate stocks and renewed optimism around Chinese economic growth lifted the Australian sharemarket on Monday, with the benchmark ASX 200 closing in on record highs.  The Index rose 0.53 per cent, or 41.3 points, to end the day at 7811.90 — inching closer to its early March all-time high of 7847. The broader All Ordinaries index lifted 0.56 per cent, or 45.2 points, to finish at 8071.5, while technology stocks booked a handsome 0.95 per cent gain to close at 3119.0. The Aussie dollar gained 0.2 per cent against the greenback to buy US65.2c at the closing bell.  Ten of 11 industry sectors ended in the green, with only discretionary recording a slight 0.01 per cent decline.  The rate-sensitive real estate sector pushed the market higher with a 1.76 per cent gain, following by energy with a 1.13 per cent lift and health care with a 1.01 per cent rise. eToro market analyst Josh Gilbert credits last week’s dovish tilt from central bankers for renewed investor confidence in real estate businesses.  “The best sector of the day was real estate and that can be put down to the dovish nature that we had from central banks last week,” he said on Monday. “Overall we have come off the back of a very risk heavy week and we’ve come through it with what I think is a pretty positive end to that week, where we have not really seen central banks go any tougher than what we expected. “If anything, they have become slightly more dovish and I think that has helped markets and that is why we are seeing real estate do well and those sort of rate sensitive sectors. “The closer we get to rate cuts, the more we are going to see investors rotate into cheaper, cyclical assets such as real estate and healthcare.” Last Thursday morning, the US Federal Reserve maintained its outlook for three interest rate cuts this year and the ASX rallied across Thursday and Friday in response. Real estate heavyweight Goodman Group jumped 3.83 per cent on Monday to hit $33.28 a share while Mirvac lifted 2.24 per cent to hit $2.28 a share and Lendlease rose 1.24 per cent to close at $6.54. Iron ore heavyweights BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue all rose again on renewed optimism around economic growth in China. Fortescue led the giants with a 3.49 per cent surge to $25.50.  But Mr Gilbert expressed caution whether last week’s commodities rally and Monday’s lift signalled a lasting turnaround for the materials sector.  “It’s really difficult to try and gather whether this is going to continue,” he said.  “We’ve had this so many times over the last 12 months, where we have got some optimism from China, where they have said once again they are going to hit that five per cent growth target but they have not signified how they are going to get there.” In corporate news, real estate firm McGrath blasted higher 24.47 per cent to 58c a share on the news global property firm Knight Frank has put in an offer to buy up the company.  Knight Frank and New Zealand real estate company Bayleys are offering McGrath shareholders 60c a share to take over the residential property business and the McGrath board has recommended shareholders agree to the scheme. Offshore maritime services provider MMA Offshore also soared on a takeover deal, rising 10.64 per cent to hit $2.60 after it entered a binding agreement with Cyan Renewables, an offshore vessel portfolio company and a subsidiary of Singapore-based Seraya Partners. The buyout offers MMA shareholders $2.60 a share. The top gainer on the ASX 200 was West African Resources, which jumped 5.04 per cent to settle at $1.14.  The biggest laggard was ALS Limited, which fell 4.8 per cent to end at $13.07.  International markets continue to help the Aussie sharemarket remain strong ahead of next Tuesday’s federal budget.

Australian shares lost ground on Tuesday, with the benchmark dragged lower by a sell-off in tech and resources stocks ahead of key inflation data locally and abroad. At the closing bell, the benchmark index, the S&P/ASX200 sank 0.4 per cent, or 31.7 points, to 7780.2, while the broader All Ordinaries slipped a similar amount to 8036.7. Local equities followed a similar pullback in shares on Wall Street. The Dow Jones led the losses, declining 0.4 per cent, while the S&P500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq both fell 0.3 per cent. The Australian dollar was flat to buy US65.40c against the greenback.  KCM Trade chief market analyst Tim Waterer said investors had taken profits ahead of fresh inflation data scheduled for release on Wednesday. “If tomorrow’s CPI numbers show that inflation is pushing higher, it could raise some further questions about just how long we may have to wait to see that first rate cut arrive from the RBA,” Mr Waterer said. Interest rate sensitive tech stocks were the worst performers, shedding 1.6 per cent.  Sector heavyweights retreated with Wisetech shares of 2.3 per cent to $94.29, Xero slid 2.7 per cent to $133.39, and NextDC sank 0.9 per cent to $17.81. Also weighing on the benchmark was the materials sector, which fell 0.7 per cent, after the iron ore futures shed 3.3 per cent to $US104.95 a tonne on the Singapore Exchange for the April contract. Miners for the key steel making ingredient edged lower. BHP slipped 0.6 per cent to $43.62, Rio Tinto eased 0.2 per cent and Fortescue fell 1.2 per cent to $25.20. Bucking the trend was a rebound in the oil price.  Brent crude rallied to $US87 a barrel after OPEC+ officials said the cartels members would push ahead with a planned extension of supply cuts despite heightened geopolitical tensions.  Woodside added one per cent to $30.37 after the firm announced it had finalised the sale of a 10 per cent stake in its Scarborough gas project to Japan LNG.  In corporate news, shares in 29Metals plunged 25.9 per cent to 40c after it announced it was suspending operations at its Capricorn Copper operation located in Queensland.  The facility has been hit with tropical storms from late January through to mid-March. Premier Investments added 4.4 per cent to $32, having hit an intraday high of $33.51 earlier in the session.  The retail conglomerate rose on plans for a proposed demerger of its Smiggle and Peter Alexander brands.  Biopharmaceutical company Mesoblast soared 45.5 per cent to 48c after the US Food and Drug Administration said there was enough clinical data for the firm to resubmit its application to treat pediatric patients with steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease. Seven Group shared slipped 4.1 per cent to $39.62 after it said it was “extremely disappointed” with “fundamental errors” in an independent review that recommended Boral shareholders should reject Seven’s buyout bid lobbed earlier this month.

Australian shares advanced on Wednesday as softer than anticipated inflation data bolstered investors’ hopes that the Reserve Bank is on track to cut interest rates this year.  At the closing bell, the S&P/ASX200 added 0.5 per cent, or 39.4 points, to reach 7819.6, while the All Ordinaries rose a similar amount to 8073.6.  The Australian dollar traded lower, buying US65.28c against the greenback. Earlier on Wednesday, the Bureau of Statistics reported the consumer price index rose 3.4 per cent in February, a steady reading on results in December and January, and slightly softer than economists’ forecasts for a 3.5 per cent increase.  Even as the result came in below expectations, Betashares chief economist David Bassanese said the reading had neutral implications for Australia’s interest rate outlook.  “It is way too early to know whether inflation so far this year is continuing to trend down at a faster or slower pace than the RBA expects,” Mr Bassanese said. Rather than the weaker than anticipated inflation read, Mr Bassanese said the recent jobs data, had a greater impact on the timing of interest rates.  “Likely more important to the near-term interest rate outlook was last week’s blockbuster labour market report, which erased the tentative signs of slowing employment growth around year end,” he added.  On the benchmark, nine of 11 industry sectors finished in the green, led by consumer staples up 1.4 per cent, as sector heavyweights Woolworths added 1.9 per cent to $33.01 and Coles rose 1.6 per cent to $16.88.  Meanwhile, tech stocks were the biggest laggards, dipping 0.5 per cent. Wistech shed 1.1 per cent to $93.28 while NextDC slipped 1.3 per cent to $17.58. In corporate news, shares in Platinum Assets Management sank 21.1 per cent to $1.10, their biggest intraday loss since 2003.  The loss came after the money manager disclosed it had lost $1.4bn in mandated funds.

Meanwhile, the broader All Ordinaries also lost ground, slipping 0.1 per cent, to 8145.8. The Australian dollar was flat, trading at US64.91c against the greenback. Fresh minutes from the Reserve Bank’s March meeting showed its board did not consider a rate hike, marking the first time since it began its aggressive run of rate hikes in May 2022 that it eschewed the option. EightCap market analyst Zoran Kresovic said while another 25 basis point hike appeared to now be “completely off the table”, markets still remained “jittery” about the timing of interest rate cuts. “There is a bit of a concern that we might need to see a bit of repricing, especially in equity markets,” Mr Kresovic said. “While the first rate cut in the US was due to come in June, it’s now getting kicked back a little bit further down the track.  “Now, the concern is the same might happen here with us in Australia.” On the benchmark, material stocks were the top performers, adding 1.1 per cent as iron ore futures rebounded above $US100 per tonne on the Singapore Exchange on the May contract, with ASX-heavyweight BHP adding 1.9 per cent to $45.13. Elsewhere in commodities, gold miners finished higher as spot prices for the precious metal traded above $US2270 an ounce.  Northern Star resources rallied 2.9 per cent to $14.88, De Grey Mining added 3.6 per cent to $1.31, and Genesis Minerals jumped 4.3 per cent to $1.94. Energy stocks also gained 0.6 per cent as oil prices rose on expectations of increased demand from China and the United States, and dampened crude oil supplies due to escalating tensions in the Middle East.

ASX listed winemakers also extended their gains after Beijing lifted punitive tariffs on the product late last week.  Treasury wine estates added 2.7 per cent to $12.79, while Australian Vintage rose five per cent to 42c.

Australian shares plunged on Wednesday, led by a sharp sell-off in interest rate sensitive tech and real estate stocks, as traders wound back their bets for rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve.  At the closing bell, the benchmark index, the S&P/ASX200 tumbled 1.3 per cent, or 105.4 points, to 7782.5. All 13 industry sectors, bar utilities and energy, finished in the red.  Meanwhile, the broader All Ordinaries index fared slightly worse, shedding 1.4 per cent of its value to close at 8033.6.  The Australian dollar was flat against the greenback to buy US65.19c.  Overnight, Wall Street slipped amid growing doubts that Fed chair Jerome Powell has done enough to tame inflation following hotter than expect job vacancies and factory output data.  While Fed policymakers reaffirmed their view that it will cut rates three times this year, bond traders trimmed their rate bet on rate cuts to just two, while yields on US 10-year treasuries rose five basis points to 4.36 per cent.  NabTrade director of investor behaviour Gemma Dale said the recent pullback in the expected timing and speed of rate cuts by the US central bank was helping to cement the view that the Reserve Bank could keep interest rates higher for longer. “We tend to adopt a similar mentality here, particularly because our rates are still currently lower,” Ms Dale said.  “There’s no reason for the RBA to rush.” After the benchmark had hit record highs at the end of the March quarter, Wednesday’s sell off had also been motivated by profit taking, Ms Dale added.  “Cash is looking extremely healthy at the moment … that’s a clear sign for investors that they’re going to put a little bit aside at this point in time.” Locally, tech stocks were the biggest laggards on the benchmark, diving 3.9 per cent, as sector heavyweights Wistech tumbled five per cent to $90.20, and Xero dropped 5.7 per cent to $125.01.  The real estate sector also finished sharply lower, falling 3.2 per cent, as Charter Hall, down 4.6 per cent to $13.01, and Vicinity Centres, down 4.8 per cent to $2.00, led losses. Investors flocked to gold miners as the safe haven commodity traded at a record high above $US2288 an ounce, while oil stocks also benefited as Brent crude prices neared just shy of $US89 a barrel amid escalating conflict in the Middle East. In corporate news, shares in Ramelius Resources added 5.3 per cent to $1.91 after the gold miner posted quarterly production of 86,928 ounces, eclipsing its previously issued guidance of up to 77,500 ounces. Rival gold miner Westgold plunged 14.8 per cent to $2.36 after it revised its production guidance for the 2023-24 financial year to between 220,000 to 230,000 tonnes. Karoon Energy was flat at $2.18 after it bolstered its forecast capital expenditure to $117m to $134m, up from $50m to $57m.

Wall Street finished higher overnight after chairman Powell said that firmer than expected economic data hadn’t changed the central bank’s view that it would cut interest rates this year.  Perpetual’s head of investment strategy Matt Sherwood, who has been sceptical about the amount of rate cuts that central banks will deliver this year, said core services inflation was proving more resilient than expected. “Outside of recession, I’d be shocked if the RBA cut rates this year — the Fed may be doing one or two,” Mr Sherwood said. “The market is starting to wake up to the fact that inflation isn’t beaten, it has been temporary goods disinflation, which has come to an end. “At the moment, the labour market remains incredibly resilient and that’s going to limit how fast central banks can cut rates.” On the local benchmark, interest rate sensitive tech stocks were the top performers on the benchmark, rallying 1.2 per cent and clawing back some of the heavy losses after yesterday’s sell off. Sector heavyweights rose, with Wisetech adding 2.5 per cent to $92.43, while NextDC climbed 2.2 per cent to $17.17. Oil prices also rose to five-month highs after OPEC+ members reaffirmed it would push ahead with planned supply cuts. With the global benchmark Brent crude nearing $US90 a barrel, Santos added 0.6 per cent to $7.88 while Viva Energy climbed 1.4 per cent to $3.75. Meanwhile, copper prices rose to 12-month high of $US4.25 a pound. 29 Metals vaulted 16.5 per cent to 53c.  Elsewhere in commodities, spot gold was trading near $US2,299 an ounce, after hitting a record high of $US2302 earlier in trading. Miners for the precious metal rallied with Northern Star Resources up 0.8 per cent to $14.79, Evolution Mining adding 1.1 per cent to $3.81, and Ramelius jumped 2.6 per cent to Capricorn Metals. In individual stocks, shares in Suncorp Group edged up 0.2 per cent to $16.38, as the insurer announced it would offload its New Zealand life insurance arm to local firm Resolution Life in a deal worth $NZ410 million. The ACCC gave the go-ahead to Cochlear’s proposed acquisition of Oticon Medical from its parent company, Demant. The ASX-listed healthcare heavyweight added 1.1 per cent to $333.59.  Boral added 0.7 per cent to $5.96 after an independent expert hired by the firm advised that Seven’s bid for the company was “not fair and reasonable”. Seven traded flat at 19c a share. International markets continue to help the Aussie sharemarket remain strong ahead of next Tuesday’s federal budget. Aussies are about to get a tax cut cash boost and most will ‘spend’ it in a surprising way. Consumer and financials were crunched on Thursday as investors grew increasingly concerned with the impact of elevated inflation on households. "},

A burgeoning renewable energy company is hoping to expand its green power footprint in Queensland with a new $800m wind farm. Renewable Energy Partners, which boasts a sweep of wind, solar and pumped hydro developments across the state, wants to implant a further 48 wind turbines in a 300MW farm about 230km west of Brisbane. If approved, the farm could power up to 180,000 homes, the company states, and help the state government achieve its ambitious target to hit 70 per cent renewable power generation by 2032.  The Merrawindi wind farm would be located adjacent to the coal-fired Millmerran power plant near Toowoomba and the company said the site was chosen for its “excellent wind resource, proximity to Powerlink’s high-voltage transmission network, strong local community support and the availability of a local, highly skilled workforce”. “We think it’s a great project and we just now have to go through the usual development steps,” REP chief executive Luke McDonald told NCA NewsWire on Thursday. “It’s got good grid, good wind resources. “In our view, it ticks all the boxes of the aspects you’re looking for in developing a project through to construction.” The company has begun internal environmental assessments but has not submitted any applications to the state or federal governments.  Mr McDonald said he expected to lodge applications for the farm in mid 2025 with a target operational date of 2028.  “Queensland is a fantastic place to develop renewable energy projects, given the strong support of the Queensland government through its Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan under the leadership of (Energy) Minister De Brenni,” he said in a release announcing Merrawindi. “As a proud Queensland-based company, REP is excited to be playing its part in the energy transition here in Queensland”. The government is spending $62bn to reconfigure the state’s energy system and move it onto a renewables base. Mr de Brenni, speaking with business leaders in Mackay in 2022 following the release of the plan, said the shift would help businesses inoculate themselves from global price shocks while also addressing climate change concerns. “(The plan will) Decouple our state, the businesses, those big electricity users, from those global price shocks. We need to move to a fuel system that is based on fuel that Queenslanders own and one that is low emissions as well,” he said. Alongside Merrawindi, REP is pursuing wind farms in Proserpine in North Queensland and in the Tarong and Wandoan areas of the southeast.  It is also developing a $6.5bn energy project west of Mackay called the Capricornia Energy Hub.  The hub, which is backed by global clean energy investment fund Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, would implant a 750MW pumped hydro plant, a 500MW wind farm and a solar farm. Mr McDonald said geotechnical work had begun on the pumped hydro component’s lower reservoir. Labor has pledged to support gas projects in a bid to keep power bills in check in a plan set to be met with significant backlash. The untapped value of an up-and-coming industry that could create thousands of jobs has been revealed in a new report. Aussies will be encouraged to take the most fuel-efficient route next time they plug in an address in this maps app. "},

Mining giant BHP is doubling down on its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives despite bubbling investor discontent over the controversial doctrines. Chief executive Mike Henry, facing a question from an investor who pleaded for the company to reject DEI and return to “meritocracy”, argued the company’s diversity policies had boosted “operational performance” and rejected the position there was a disconnect between DEI aspirations and delivering shareholder returns. “At the same time we have been focused on those things, company performance has lifted,” he said. “We’ve gone from being an operational laggard in the industry to now leading the industry when it comes to our op performance. Returns for shareholders have been strong. “And so not only do I believe both things can be achieved in parallel, I believe that what is required to achieve some of those things actually boosts underlying performance as well.” The $214bn behemoth is pursuing a range of diversity and environmental, social and governance commitments, from a gender balanced workforce by 2025 to net-zero operational emissions by 2050. It also backed last year’s Voice to Parliament proposition, though some investors expressed frustration at the position and said the company’s pro-Voice stance had created a fissure between management and shareholders. BHP chair Ken MacKenzie, speaking at the company’s shareholder meeting in Adelaide in November, argued there were “clear business reasons” for backing constitutional change.  “We operate on the traditional lands of Indigenous peoples,” he said.  “These are critical relationships.” A push for more diverse workforces has swept through corporate Australia in recent years, a response in part to reflect the country’s changing demographics and a sense traditionally organised workplaces may have unfairly shut out some workers from equal opportunity. Female participation at BHP had moved from 16 per cent 2016 to about 35 per cent now, Mr Henry said. “That is going to both boost and then support sustainable high performance for the company into the future,” he said. BHP’s female workforce traverses the company hierarchy, from new apprentices at its Central Queensland coalfields to the upper echelons of the miner’s leadership structure, including chief financial officer Vandita Pant and Australia president Geraldine Slattery. Mr Henry also reaffirmed the company would spend money to hit net-zero operational emissions by 2050 and was working with equipment manufacturers to deliver battery electric trucks and locomotives to its mine sites at the end of this decade.  BHP has already signed an MOU with car giant Toyota to electrify its 5000 diesel-powered work vehicles.  It is also purchasing renewable energy to power its mine sites. Mr Henry and Ms Pant said the company would “partner” with its steelmaking customers on low carbon technologies to lower scope 3 emissions. “We are working very hard to make sure that we are very much across all of these technologies, which over the next few decades will start to come in as steel decarbonises,” Ms Pant said. In Australia, BHP operates coalmines in Queensland and NSW, iron ore mines in Western Australia and copper mines in South Australia. Health and workers’ rights advocates are pushing ministers to curtail asbestos, warning it could linger into the next century despite being banned in 2003. The Aussie sharemarket has remained strong in the wake of a less than ‘hawkish’ interest rates decision by the Reserve Bank of Australia. Ahead of the central bank’s impending interest rate decisions, investors on the Australian share market were in an upbeat mood. "},

Supermarket catalogues from years gone by are set to shock Aussie shoppers. While many have felt the pinch of the cost-of-living crisis in the post Covid-19 world, the catalogues dug up over the past decade show just how drastically things have changed. One catalogue taken from the archives in 2014 shows a 24 pack of Kleenex toilet paper costing just $10, with the same product costing $13.50 at Woolworths today. Meanwhile, a 600g block of tasty cheese set shoppers back $6 a decade ago, with the product now doubled in price and worth $12. The same 2014 Woolworths catalogue shows a 30 pack of soft drink on sale for $19, meaning the cans come to just 64c each. In 2024, the same amount of cans costs Aussies more than double at $47.20. Shoppers will be shocked to see the price of chips has risen exponentially, with a bag of 175g Thins costing just $2 in 2014. At the moment, chip fans can get the same product for double that at $4, on sale from the usual price of $5. In 2015, Cadbury chocolate bars were just $3.50 each, while 750ml of olive oil put shoppers back just $8.50. Now the chocolate costs $6, while the same amount of olive oil is now worth $20. Another 2015 catalogue from Woolworths shows TimTams priced at $2 for a pack, with shoppers in 2024 paying double. Coles catalogues from 2014 show much of the same, with a loaf of Helga’s bread costing just $3 a decade ago and the same loaf now costing $4.90. A block of Bega cheese used to put shoppers back just $4 at Coles, with the same product now costing $7.50. Shockingly, the price of biscuits at Coles hasn’t changed much, with Arnott’s scotch fingers costing $2 in 2014 and now available for $2.50. With Easter just around the corner, it’s interesting to note how much the prices of seasonal treats have changed. A 2016 catalogue has revealed that a 20-pack of Cadbury hollow Easter eggs set shoppers back just $7, meaning the eggs were 35c each. Catalogues in 2022 show a 10 pack of Easter eggs costing just $3.75, meaning eggs were about the same price in 2016. Just two years later in 2024, the “hunting eggs” come in a pack of 24 and cost shoppers $12.50. This means the eggs are 50c a pop. In 2015, the iconic Lindt gold bunny cost $4, with Woolworths now selling the product for double at $8. Supermarket prices have been a hot topic since inflation and the cost-of-living crisis began hitting Aussies last year. While experts say it’s normal for produces of goods and services to increase over time, the increase after Covid has been rapid, hurting households across the country. An inquiry into supermarket prices has been told the companies are making excessive profits by using their significant market power to set unfair pricing practices. Repeated interest rates have also hit business and households hard, with fuel prices soaring to new highs, power bills doubling and rents hitting unprecedented levels. All of this together with higher prices at the checkout, it’s clear why Aussies are feeling the pressure. Four separate reviews, including a competition watchdog price inquiry, into the conduct of the supermarket chains are under way. Politicians from all sides have been heaping the pressure on the supermarket duopoly in recent months after Coles and Woolworths returned profits that exceeded $1bn last financial year. Both Coles and Woolies have previously denied engaging in price gouging. A Woolworths spokesperson told NCA NewsWire that the company understood many Aussie families were doing it tough and looking for relief at the checkout. “While looking back at catalogues might see some different prices, what hasn’t changed is our commitment to bringing the best of Australian fresh fruit and vegetables to our customers,” the spokesperson said. “In the 14 months from November 2021 to January 2023, we received more than 1800 cost increase requests from our long-life suppliers with an average per month 4.5x our pre-Covid volumes. “So there’s always a balance to maintain of paying suppliers fairly, rewarding our team and as well ensuring customers get their Woolies worth when they shop with us.” Coles has been contacted for comment. A young Aussie has slammed the “out of touch” question she was asked when visiting her local bank, revealing she was left “baffled” by the interaction. More than half of Australian mortgage holders are considering selling off their belongings, or even their home, as a result of rising loan repayments. Homeowners are feeling the pinch of the cost-of-living crisis, with the number of loans past due at ANZ increasing double digits. "},

A surging mining sector pushed the Australian sharemarket higher on Tuesday, even as the Reserve Bank warned further interest rate rises were still possible as the Board battled to return inflation to a two to three per cent target band.  The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index lifted 0.36 per cent, or 27.4 points, to end the day at 7703.2 points.  The broader All Ordinaries index rose 0.41 per cent, or 32.6 points, to finish at 7957.8 while the technology index slipped 0.15 per cent to close 4.6 points lower at 3056.1. Mining giant BHP jumped three per cent to hit $43.69 a share after iron ore prices rebounded to more than $100 per tonne following weeks of sustained falls. Rio Tinto rose 2.3 per cent to end the day at $120.18. eToro market analyst Josh Toro said the commodities uplift had pulled up the broader ASX given the outsized weighting of the bourse’s mining stocks. “BHP will be by far the biggest pull on the market to the upside,” he said. “That’s a big boost to the market.” Four of 11 industry sectors ended in the green, with Materials leading with a 2.11 per cent gain. Energy closed 1.98 per cent higher and Real Estate and Utilities also booked gains.  Industrials, IT, Health Care, Discretionary, Telecommunications, Financials and Staples ended in the red.  Energy powerhouses Woodside Petroleum and Santos lifted 2.33 per cent and 1.77 per cent, respectively. The RBA left the cash rate unchanged at 4.35 per cent but said in a statement the interest rate path remained “uncertain” and the Board would not rule “anything in or out.” Mr Gilbert said the RBA’s Tuesday statement would likely push back the time frame for an interest rate cut.  “It has pushed the financial sector back a fair bit because we’ve seen those rate cut expectations firmly pushed back,” he said.  “Before this week, markets saw about a 70 per cent chance we would get a cut in June, whereas as of today, after the decision that is at about 50 per cent.  “And markets are really looking now towards August as that day. “She (RBA Governor Michele Bullock) has reiterated, it is going to be a bumpy ride to get inflation back to target and they are not going to be in a rush to cut interest rates.” Ms Bullock flagged economic headwinds from China as a key point of uncertainty for the Board and said the “war” against inflation was not yet “won”. “We can’t rule anything in or out,” she told reporters after the decision.  The big four banks all edged lower, with Commonwealth Bank closing 0.58 per cent to settle at $115.78 a share, Westpac falling 0.3 per cent to hit $26.25 a share, NAB dipping 0.26 per cent to $33.94 and ANZ falling 0.21 per cent to close at $28.80.  The Aussie dollar fell 0.53 per cent against the Greenback to buy US65.2c. In corporate news, KMD Brands, which boasts the RipCurl and Kathmandu clothing lines, rose 2.1 per cent throughout the day despite posting a 14.5 per cent fall in half-year revenues to $468m and a net loss of $9.6m. Queensland coal business New Hope Corporation lifted 3.84 per cent after reporting a half-year net profit of $251.7m. Gold miner Bellevue Gold boomed seven per cent to hit $1.83 a share.

A 50-year-old construction company that accrued $20m of debt in the past two months has gone into administration. Company directors of Property Coordination (Australia) made the “soul destroying” decision to relinquish control and appoint RSM Australia Partners as voluntary administrators on Tuesday. RSM Australia Partners administrator Jonathon Colbran said even though the company had a $90m pipeline of future work, they did not have enough funds to continue operating. “Despite injecting a significant amount of their own personal money into the company, the directors advised me that losses incurred from fixed price contracts combined with escalating subcontractor, supplier and operating costs had negatively impacted the company financially,’’ he said. Project Coordination (Australia) had been operating in Canberra and Wollongong for the past five decades. On Tuesday, about 55 staff members were informed they had been made redundant, many of whom had been with the company for more than 15 years. Property Coordination chairman Paul Murphy and managing director Gavin Murphy said in a statement that they agonised over the decision. “Despite seeing other construction companies collapse around us over the past year, we never thought we would be one of them,” they said in a statement. “We thought we had the means, forward order book, capability and industry goodwill to get through this.” The company had $120m worth of projects in the field and another $90m ready to start, but the directors could not secure external investment. “The economic and regulatory environment that building companies are working in now is more challenging than any other I’ve experienced in the past 50 years – worse than the recessions in the 1980s and 1990s and the Global Financial Crisis in 2007-08,” Mr Murphy said. “Nothing has been as bad as this.’’ Project Coordination (Australia) is the latest company in a series of building and construction company insolvencies. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported the construction industry lost $5.4bn in 2022. In recent years, the industry has continually faced increased costs, skilled worker shortages and productivity issues.

Australia’s big miners added to Tuesday’s materials rally, with BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue up 0.5 per cent, 0.76 per cent and 0.86 per cent respectively, but the lift wasn’t enough to carry the broader materials sector into the green.

The benchmark ASX 200 index lost 11.4 points, or 0.15 per cent, to finish the session at 7770.6 points. Some of the worst performing stocks were Genesis Minerals (down 6.25 per cent to $1.80) and Bellevue Gold (down 5.28 per cent to $1.88). Among the big winners were Fisher and Paykel Healthcare (up 7.71 per cent to $24.18) after the company upgraded its profit forecast, Virgin Money UK (up 4.05 per cent to $4.11) and Goodman (up 3.39 per cent to $32.05). The index is currently 1.05 per cent off of its 52-week high. The broader All Ordinaries also closed lower, dipping 18.3 points, or 0.23 per cent, to 8026.3 points. Six of 11 sectors tumbled, including energy down 1.3 per cent and materials dropping 0.87 per cent. Property bucked the trend, lifting 1.43 per cent, while healthcare was up 1.34 per cent. The Australian dollar is trading at US65.32c — down about 1c on Thursday. In the resources sector, BHP fell 0.82 per cent, while Rio Tinto dipped 0.48 per cent, Fortescue Metals dropped 2.11 per cent and Woodside closed 1.75 per cent lower. In banking, CBA lost 0.44 per cent, Westpac weakened 0.75 per cent, ANZ climbed 0.10 per cent and NAB closed 0.06 per cent lower.  CommSec chief economist Craig James said it was a very quiet day for company news. “But lower gold and oil prices weighed on shares,” he said. “Overnight, a raft of central banks held policy meetings and it was a mixed bag.  “No change in rates in England or Norway, but Switzerland cut rates for the first time in seven years and Brazil also lowered interest rates.” Looking at the week ahead, the monthly consumer price index data will come out on Wednesday. NAB economists have forecast headline CPI to be up 3.6 per cent year-on-year in February. CBA and Westpac economists expect annual inflation to rise to 3.8 per cent. ANZ expects annual inflation to rise slightly to 3.5 per cent. It will also be a big week for dividend payouts, with about $18.8bn to be paid out to investors. International markets continue to help the Aussie sharemarket remain strong ahead of next Tuesday’s federal budget. Aussies are about to get a tax cut cash boost and most will ‘spend’ it in a surprising way.

Australian shares edged higher on Monday as the benchmark was dragged lower by a sharp sell-off in real estate stocks, ahead of a run of key central bank decisions.  At the closing bell, the S&P/ASX200 added just 0.1 per cent, or 5.5 points, to sit at 7675.8, while the broader All Ordinaries was unchanged at 7925.2. The Australian dollar finished higher, adding 0.1 per cent to US65.65c.  Alongside the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan, the Reserve Bank will meet this week, where it is largely expected to keep interest rates on hold at 4.35 per cent. Kyle Rodda, senior financial market analyst at Capital.com, said a recent spate of weaker-than-expected economic data had raised the possibility of a dovish pivot from the RBA at Tuesday’s meeting.  “While (inflation is) still above the RBA’s two-to-three per cent target band, the trend is clearly to the downside and may indicate a shift in the balance of risks for interest rate policy and Australian economic fundamentals,” Mr Rodda said. However, despite recent data flows, bond traders have tempered their expectations for an easing in interest rates, with money markets now fully priced for a cut by November, bringing the cash rate to 4.1 per cent. Previously, they were fully priced for a 25 basis point cut in September.  Interest rate sensitive property stocks were the biggest laggard on the benchmark, shedding 1.9 per cent. Sector heavyweights Goodman Group sank 3.6 per cent to $29.74, Charter Hall lost 1.9 per cent to $13.20, and Scentre slipped 1.8 per cent to $3.28. The resources sector added 0.3 per cent after iron ore prices on the SGX rose 1.3 per cent to $US101.20 for the April contract, after the key steelmaking ingredient hit a eight-month low over the weekend. Heavyweight miners were mixed with Rio Tinto adding 0.5 per cent to $117.48, while Fortescue slipped 1.1 per cent to $23.69. BHP was unchanged at $42.41. Financials were the top performers, rising 0.6 per cent.  The big four banks all finished higher, led by Commonwealth Bank up 0.8 per cent to $116.46.  ANZ added 0.6 per cent to $28.86, Westpac rose 0.5 per cent to $26.33, and NAB rallied 0.7 per cent to $34.03.  In corporate news, South32 suspended operations at its manganese mine located on the island of Groote Eylandt, 630km east of Darwin, after the site was struck by Cyclone Megan. Shares added 4.7 per cent to $3.14.  After losing a white-label deal to rival Superloop, Aussie Broadband was instructed to cut its 20 per cent stake in the internet provider in order to comply with Singaporean regulations.  Shares in Superloop shed 6.4 per cent to $1.18, while Aussie Broadband added 0.6 per cent to $3.57.

Former Qantas executive Olivia Wirth has been appointed the new chief executive of Myer on the same day the department store revealed a staggering net profit of more than $50m. Previously the chief executive of Qantas Loyalty, Ms Wirth will take on the role of chief executive and executive chair at the retail giant, Myer announced on Thursday.  Following a shake-up of management, Ms Wirth quit Qantas in October last year and joined the 124-year-old retailers board just one month later.  Ms Wirth will begin her duties as chair on Thursday following the resignation of Myer’s current chairman Ari Mervis, and will start as chief executive on June 4 when she will replace John King.  “I am honoured to lead one of Australia’s iconic businesses and brands into a new and exciting phase,” she said on Thursday. “Myer is loved by millions of Australians and is one of the nation’s most enduring retailers thanks to the dedication and skill of our team members, and the loyalty of our customers. “My immediate priorities will be ensuring we are delivering a great in-store experience with a world-class range and best-in-class customer service, while investing in e-commerce and harnessing loyalty and partnerships among our customers and suppliers.  “I want to thank both Ari and John for their service to Myer and support.” Mr Mervis said Ms Wirth’s appointment would begin a “new era” for the storied company. “Olivia is an experienced and respected leader with a track record of delivering improved business performance,” he said.  “She transformed Qantas Loyalty into one of Australia’s most successful customer engagement and omni-retail businesses.  “Since joining the board last year, Olivia has demonstrated impressive commercial acumen and an acute understanding of the dynamics facing both Myer and the broader retail sector.” The announcement comes as the retail brand recorded an impressive half-year profit despite months of interest rate rises hitting household budgets and fresh warnings of slowing consumer spending. Myer recorded a net profit after tax of $52m for the half-year ending December 31, 2023, a 20 per cent decline on the $65m it booked in the prior corresponding period. It booked $1.82bn in sales, a 3 per cent decline year-on-year. Group comparable sales growth at the company, or sales from the company’s existing stores, also held steady from the record sales it recorded in the prior period, marking a 0.1 per cent increase.  Mr King said the company’s “customer first plan” had delivered for the business “despite the macro economic conditions”. “We were able to achieve a strong comparable sales outcome, cycling our best ever first-half sales on record in FY2023 and saw improvements in our market share across both stores and online,” he said on Wednesday.  “Our underlying profit result has remained robust despite the impacts from our Brisbane store closure and increased promotional cadence.” The company announced it would return some $25m to investors, with an interim dividend of 3c per share. Online sales growth rose two per cent to hit $390.1m or 21.3 per cent of total sales.  Despite the profit fall, investors cheered the results when the market opened on Thursday morning, noting they come in challenging conditions for retailers after 13 rate hikes hit consumers from May 2022 through to November 2023. The company’s share price popped more than five per cent at the opening bell.  eToro market analyst Josh Gilbert said the results showed the company was “weathering the storm”.  “Their numbers certainly aren’t setting the world alight, but they offered some positivity on sales for the first six weeks of the second half of the year,” he said on Thursday morning.  “That’s good news, especially given the slowdown in retail sales we’re witnessing. “All in all, it’s a pretty decent result.” Mr King said comparable sales were up 4.9 per cent for the first six weeks of 2024. “Like all retailers, we continue to remain cautious about the macro-economic environment; however, we are encouraged with our results for the first six weeks of 2H and have a strong program of deliverables to roll out during the first half as part of our ‘customer first plan’,” he said. The company’s share price has boomed nearly 40 per cent year-to-date, including a sharp 14.3 per cent jump on February 6 after Myer released guidance on its expected results for the half-year and said it expected profits to land somewhere between $49m and $53m.  A popular soft drink product has been recalled from Coles, Woolies and Dan Murphy’s. Shoppers have described being locked down in Perth’s biggest shopping centre after a terrifying knife incident that left one man with a slash to the face, with two people on the run.

The local share market snapped a two-day winning streak on Thursday as a sell-off in banking stocks offset a rebound in the resources sector.

Investors are looking for fresh clues on how soon and aggressively the US Federal Reserve can commence rate cuts.  However, with bond traders pricing in a 70 per cent chance of a rate cut by June, Westpac chief economist said recent inflation data was yet to provide enough comfort for central banks to begin easing monetary policy. “Lurking behind this question about the timing of the first rate cut are much bigger and more difficult questions about the size of the easing cycle and where ‘neutral’ may now lie,” Ms Ellis wrote in a note to clients. “Indeed, the sort of uncertainty we are seeing now may be a recurring theme in the next policy phase.” Locally, financials shed 1.9 per cent after a run of downgrades by analysts at Macquarie.  Of the big four banks, ANZ and Westpac shed 3.8 per cent to $28.68 and $26.47, respectively.  NAB slipped 2.8 per cent to $33.50, and Commonwealth Bank sank 1.1 per cent to $116.22.

The Australian sharemarket fell on Friday on the back of an iron ore slump and a Wall Street fall fuelled by hotter-than-expected inflation figures. The benchmark ASX 200 slipped 0.56 per cent, or 43.30 points, to end the day at 7670.30, while the broader All Ordinaries index fell 0.6 per cent to end at 7926.2. Australia’s technology stocks fell a sharper 1.17 per cent, or 36.3 points, to close out the week at 3057.5.  The bourse had slumped 1.6 per cent in intraday trading but trimmed its losses throughout the afternoon.  Wall Street fell overnight after hotter-than-expected producer prices fuelled fears the US Federal Reserve might delay or trim expected rate cuts in 2024. “There is just broad weakness in equity markets today going into next week’s central bank meetings,” Kyle Rodda, senior financial market analyst at capital.com, said on Friday. “Some strong inflation data combined with some pretty strong labour market reports over the last month and some other economic statistics suggest the US economy is fairly resilient, there is a concern that maybe the Fed might back away from projecting the number of cuts in the year ahead that it did back in December, when it released its last statement of economic projections. “So it is effectively a little bit of risk-off going into this event on the fear that maybe the Fed will guide for fewer interest rate cuts than before.” Fears of slowing growth in China also propelled Friday’s sell-off.  “We’ve seen some pretty broad weakness in commodity prices overall, but the iron ore miners have been a pretty significant weight all week,” Mr Rodda said. “There has been a bit of a sell-off in iron ore since the National People’s Congress in China. “The general perception is that they provided a fairly robust growth target, but not enough substance, or didn’t announce enough substantial measures to fill the markets with confidence they can achieve it. “So we’ve seen commodities drift lower, iron ore in particular being that proxy for Chinese economic demand, steel demand.” Iron ore giants BHP and Rio Tinto ended 1.51 per cent and 1.88 per cent lower, respectively.  Eight of 11 industry sectors declined, led by materials with a 1.91 per cent fall.  Financials, telecommunications, staples, health care, industrials, IT, discretionary and materials all ended in the red, while energy, utilities and real estate booked gains. The ASX 200 fell 2.6 per cent for the week.  The Aussie dollar edged 0.2 per cent lower against the Greenback to buy 0.65 cents at the closing bell. In corporate news, Tabcorp, Australia’s largest gambling company, tanked 5.23 per cent on news its chief executive Adam Rytenskild had left the business following allegations of inappropriate language.  Shares in the $1.64bn company ended the day at 72 cents. Lithium miners suffered steep falls, with Pilbara Minerals falling 6.23 per cent and Liontown Resources collapsing 8.42 per cent.  Core Lithium fell 5.26 per cent throughout the day for a weekly slump of 14.29 per cent.  Energy behemoth Woodside Petroleum lifted 2.47 per cent to close at $29.86 a share.

Households are set to be spared from further pain at the Reserve Bank’s March meeting, but borrowers hoping for relief in the form of rate cuts may have to wait longer still. While bond markets imply next to no chance that the official cash rate will increase on Tuesday, traders on Monday tempered their expectations for an easing in interest rates, and are now fully priced for a cut by November, bringing the cash rate to 4.1 per cent.  Previously, a cut in September was fully priced in, with a strong chance of further easing in monetary policy at the central bank’s November meeting.  Traders in the United States have similarly trimmed their rate cuts bets after firmer-than-anticipated inflation data released last week showed price pressures rebounded in the world’s largest economy. Since January, US investors have pared back expectations of rate cuts from six to just three as inflationary pressures remain stubbornly high. With Australia’s labour market remaining exceptionally tight, still elevated inflation, anaemic productivity growth, and the added stimulatory impact of the stage three tax cuts, some economic analysts have delayed their forecasts for rate relief. Indeed, a survey of economists published by financial comparison service Finder found seven of 34 participants did not expect the central bank to begin curing rates by 2025 at the earliest.  Capital Economics’ Abhiji Surya said the central bank’s reluctance to “dial back” its inflation fighting rhetoric was due to “its concerns that the last mile in the fight against inflation could be the hardest.” Meanwhile, HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham said it was unlikely the RBA would shift its language on the outlook for interest rates.  “We expect the RBA to remain on hold in March and the board discussion to be about whether another hike is needed, rather than about any prospect of rate cuts,” Mr Bloxham said.  Tuesday’s interest rate decision is also the central bank’s first fully-staffed board meeting since the departure of former governor Philip Lowe’s seven-year run at the helm of the bank.  Since then, former deputy governor Michele Bullock has been promoted to the top job and Bank of England official Andrew Hauser has joined the ranks of Australia’s central bank following a 31-year stint at the BoE. Sarah Hunter, previously at Treasury, has also been appointed as the RBA’s chief economist. Labor will pour billions more into building new homes in a move welcomed by the housing sector, but slammed by its political opponents. Treasurer Jim Chalmers has flagged measures to encourage Australians to have more babies will be included in next Tuesday’s federal budget.

Australian shares pushed higher for a second consecutive session on Wednesday after Wall Street shrugged off firmer-than-expected US inflation data overnight.  The benchmark index, the S&P/ASX200 added 0.2 per cent, or 16.9 points, to close at 7729.4, with seven of 11 industry sectors finishing in the green, led by gains in retail, healthcare and banking stocks. Meanwhile, the broader All Ordinaries also advanced by a similar amount to 7989.5. US equities rallied overnight with the S&P500 resetting its record at 5175.27, up 1.1 per cent, even as fresh CPI data for February came in just above market expectations and bond yields rose. Perpetual’s head of investment strategy Matt Sherwood said despite the modest uptick in inflation, investors expected the US Federal Reserve wouldn’t delay rate cuts beyond June. “You’d have to see another solid print in March, and probably at a higher rate, for the Fed to really question whether they have the room to cut rates given the disinflation we have seen over the past six months or so,” Mr Sherwood said. However, Mr Sherwood added that the Fed would have to see momentum for services inflation ease before it was confident it could cut rates.  “There’s some risk that the market’s expectations of a start [to cuts] around mid-year may be a bit late,” he added. Locally, consumer discretionary stocks were the top gainers, adding 1.3 per cent, with Premier Investments adding 2.6 per cent to $30.17 and Aristocrat climbing 2.1 per cent to $46.86. Financials also performed strongly, up 0.9 per cent. Macquarie hit an intraday high of $200 a share, its highest since May 2022, before closing at $199.61, up 0.9 per cent. Material stocks were the biggest laggards, easing 0.8 per cent, with gold stocks dipping as prices for the precious metal slipped to $US2164 an ounce following the inflation print. Northern Star Resources sank 2.3 per cent to $13.75, Bellevue Gold slipped 1.9 per cent to $1.58, and Regis Resources eased 1.5 per cent to $1.95. Elsewhere in the resources sector, iron ore miners extended their sell-off as prices for the commodity tumbled on high inventories and weak demand from Beijing.  On the Singapore exchange, iron ore futures on the April contract shed 4.3 per cent to $US104.55 a tonne – a six month low. In mid-February, prices for the key steel ingredient were fetching more than $US130 a tonne.  Despite the decline, it was a mixed session for the heavyweight producers. While BHP slipped 1.3 per cent to $41.95 and Fortescue shed 1 per cent to $24.50, Rio Tinto advanced 1.4 per cent to $116.95. Mr Sherwood said China was in the early stages of a five-year “household deleveraging cycle” which would see a structural decline in housing construction, and consequently iron ore prices.  “While there will be increased infrastructure investment to offset the growth impact here, it just won’t be as steel intensive,” he added. In a note to clients, CBA commodity strategist Vivek Dhar warned that iron ore prices would likely continue to erode, dipping below $US100 in the short term, as profit margins across China’s steel mills fell. Despite the drag from iron ore miners, the Australian dollar finished higher at US66.12c.  In corporate news, Liontown Resources jumped 6.1 per cent to $1.40 as it announced a new $550m debt deal, funded in part by Commonwealth Bank and NAB, for its Kathleen Valley lithium mine located in Western Australia. Meanwhile, fellow miner Core Lithium plunged 9.1 per cent to 20c, its biggest intraday loss since January 8, after it released dismal half-year results. Unveiling the results, which showed a post-tax loss of $167.6m, chief executive Gareth Manderson announced his resignation, with current CFO Doug Warden to head the miner in the interim.  Penfolds owner Treasury Wine Estates rallied 1.5 per cent to $12.46 on news that the Chinese Ministry of Commerce was proposing a removal of damaging tariffs affecting growers. A final determination will be released in coming weeks which could deliver the firm an extra $100m in profits, analysts predicted.

The Australian share market moved little on Tuesday as investors awaited fresh US inflation data for clues on when the Federal Reserve will move to cut interest rates.

The Australian dollar was flat at US65.15c.  After almost $50bn of value was wiped from the local sharemarket on Monday, IG Australia market analyst Tony Sycamore said Tuesday’s session had been a much needed stabiliser. “While the bears will take some comfort from the ASX200’s inability to muster a rebound of substance today, the bulls will be relieved that the sell order that hit the market yesterday appears to have disappeared for now,” Mr Sycamore said. However, fresh US CPI figures to be released on Tuesday evening (AEDT) that are expected to show a further moderation in price growth could test equities once again, Mr Sycamore added. “If the New Year price rises don’t fall out as expected and Core CPI comes in at 3.9 per cent year-on-year or higher, it will likely see the selling return as global equities, including the ASX200, extend their retreat” he said.

Wisetech advanced 1.8 per cent to $97.17, Xero rose 1.2 per cent to $135.63 and NextDC lifted 0.5 per cent to $17.48. Gold stocks continued to push higher as prices for the precious metal advanced for the ninth consecutive session, sitting just below $US2200 an ounce. Bellevue Gold was the star performer on the benchmark, adding 10.3 per cent to $1.61, after a production update showed it was on track to meet guidance of 75,000-85,000 ounces for the six months to June.

Banking behemoth Westpac will cut 132 job cuts from its risk-management, operations and sales divisions, with some of the positions expected to shift offshore to India and The Philippines. The Financial Services Union confirmed the cuts this week and said 62 would go from the risk division, while 50 positions from operations would be offshored to contract companies Genpact, TATA Consulting Services and Concentrix.  A further 20 cuts from sales were announced to the FSU in January, with the jobs also shifting abroad.  FSU national secretary Julia Angrisano said the cuts and Westpac’s offshoring move would hammer staff morale. “Westpac’s strategy of continually outsourcing jobs to external service providers does nothing for staff morale and sends the message that staff need to toe the line or their jobs could be offshored,” she said. “Forget loyalty and hard work from its employees. Westpac isn’t interested in building an effective corporate culture that delivers for customers and staff. It’s only interested in generating even greater profits.” The cuts are small matched to the overall size of the company, which boasts a $91bn market capitalisation and more than 30,000 employees across Australia. But they follow sharp cuts from 2023 with the financial services firm slashing hundreds of jobs. A wave of redundancies have hit the financial services sector in recent months as banks move to control costs and protect margins. NAB, Commonwealth Bank and ANZ all announced substantial cuts last year with the total number of job losses from the “big four” hitting more than 2000. A Westpac spokesman told NCA NewsWire the bank would provide “tailored support and assistance with career transition” to affected employees. “We try to keep as many employees in the Westpac Group as we can through retraining and redeployment,” the spokesman said. “These changes are in head office and operational functions and represent less than half a per cent of our workforce.” Ms Angrisano said the cuts from the bank’s risk department could expose customers to an elevated “scammer” threat.  “The same day that Westpac notified the FSU about job losses in the risk division, CEO Peter King told the ASX that ‘risk management remains a priority’,” Ms Angrisano said, referencing Mr King’s remarks in Westpac’s financial year 2024 1st quarter earnings release from February 19. “Westpac is also party to the new Australian Banking Association strategy to cut the numbers of scams hitting bank customers, including limiting payments flowing offshore to risky overseas crypto-currency platforms. “How on earth does Peter King think Westpac can protect the bank and its customers from the proliferation of scammers when it is cutting so deeply into its risk division?” Westpac reported a $1.5bn net profit for the three months up to December 31, 2023, which Mr King called a “solid quarter”. “We’ve grown the franchise and maintained a strong financial position,” he said. Year-to-date, Westpac’s stock price is up 13.4 per cent. Aussies are about to get a tax cut cash boost and most will ‘spend’ it in a surprising way. Locals are fuming over ANZ’s shock move after the bank posted a profit of more than $7 billion last year. As the Commonwealth Bank boss announced a profit slide, he said one thing was providing a “tailwind” for the Australian economy. "},

Australian shares struggled to gain momentum on Tuesday as a rally in the healthcare and materials sectors was offset by declines in consumer stocks. At the closing bell, the benchmark index, the ASX200 had retreated 0.15 per cent, or 11.6 points, to 7724.2, while the All Ordinaries slipped by 0.1 per cent to 7988.3. The Australian dollar dipped to buy US65.01c. Capital.com senior market analyst Kyle Rodda said after reaching a record high last week, the share market was tracking sideways as investors awaited a fresh batch of economic data from the United States. “We’re continuing to look for obvious signs of potential disinflation and the prospect of rate cuts out of the US,” Mr Rodda said.  “Any kind of surprise that suggests there’s re-acceleration in inflation – that’s going to really upset investors. But for now, things actually look pretty solid.” Four of 13 industry sectors finished in the green, led by healthcare stocks which increased 1 per cent. Gold stocks continued to advance as the precious metal struck a three-month high of $US2127. St Barbara vaulted 12.5 per cent to 18c, Regis Resources climbed 5.5 per cent to $2.03 and Evolution Mining added 3.6 per cent to $3.20.  Elsewhere in commodities, iron ore miners rebounded. BHP rose 0.9 per cent to $44.63, Rio Tinto added 1.1 per cent to $124.77 and Fortescue firmed 1.9 per cent to $25.84. However, gains in the sector were partly offset after US-listed lithium miner Albemarle announced it was seeking to raise $US2.1bn ($AU3.2bn) in a share issue to investors as it sought to stem losses due to dwindling commodity prices.  ASX-listed lithium producers retreated on the news with Pilbara Minerals off 7 per cent to $4.10, IGO down 5.3 per cent to $7.73, and Liontown 4.1 per cent lower to $1.28. Meanwhile, consumer stocks were the biggest laggards as sector heavyweights Coles, Endeavour Group and Lovisa traded ex-dividend. Ahead of key GDP figures to be released on Wednesday, fresh data from the Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday eased fears that the Australian economy may have contracted during the December quarter, after it showed improved terms of trade, bolstered by higher export prices for coal and iron ore. “The larger than expected net exports addition and an increase in public sector inventories provide an offset to the weak private inventories data reported yesterday,” ANZ economist Blair Chapman said. Meanwhile, at a meeting of its National People’s Congress on Tuesday, China announced an economic growth target of “around 5 per cent”, a goal analysts labelled as ambitious granted the dual challenges of weak investor confidence and the country’s debt-laden property sector. “In the absence of last year’s tailwind from the pandemic rebound, that will be hard to achieve,” NAB senior economist Taylor Nugent said. Bitcoin, the most traded cryptocurrency, continued to advance, resetting its two-year high at US$68,828. In corporate news, Telix Pharmaceuticals added 1.2 per cent to $12 after the drug maker announced its acquisition of Canadian tech firm ARTMS in a deal worth $126 million.  Medibank Private shares rose 1.6 per cent to $3.75, after the health insurer announced it was raising its premiums by 3.3 per cent, above the industry average premium increase of 3 per cent, after approval from Health Minister Mark Butler. Rival health insurer NIB also added 3.4 per cent to $7.85. Its customers will incur a premium hike of 4.1 per cent. Embattled pathology provider Healius jumped 14.7 per cent to $1.29, its biggest intraday gain since June 2020. The firm has commenced a strategic review of its assets and structure, while CFO Paul Anderson will succeed Maxine Jaquet as chief executive and managing director.

The Australian dollar pushed higher against the greenback to buy US65.19c. Fresh GDP numbers released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday showed the economy expanded by just 0.2 per cent in the December quarter — in line with consensus forecasts.  “The Australian economy is in the midst of a cyclical low point, with policy settings and fast inflation curbing growth,” Oxford Economics head of macroeconomic forecasting Sean Langcake said. Six of 11 industry sectors finished in the green, led by financials up 0.8 per cent. The big four banks all finished higher with Commonwealth Bank adding 1.2 per cent to $118.31, Westpac up 1.1 per cent to $26.94 and NAB climbing one per cent to $34.10. ANZ shares added one per cent to $29.02 after it sold its 16.5 per cent stake in AMMB Holdings for $683.5m, reducing its shareholding to just 5.2 per cent.

Sector heavyweights Wisetech sank 2.6 per cent to $93.16 and Xero dropped 0.9 per cent to $133.30. Bitcoin briefly traded as high as $69,202 overnight, setting a record high for the world’s most-traded cryptocurrency. Gemma Dale, director of investor behaviour at NAB Trade, said the rally in gold stocks and Bitcoin might still push higher. “(There’s) perhaps two different generations with a view on what a flight to safety looks like … I think there’s potential for those to run a little bit further,” Ms Dale said.  In corporate news, embattled money manager Magellan Financial Group surged 7.9 per cent to $9.21 after it reported total funds under management had increased to $37.2bn in February, up from $36.3bn the month prior, however there were net outflows of $20m.  Qantas Airways shed 2.2 per cent to $5.01 after the national carrier was hit with a $250,000 penalty after it was found guilty of breaching workplace health and safety laws and discriminatory conduct when it stood down a worker who raised Covid-19 concerns.

The Australian sharemarket surged to a near record high on Thursday as investors expressed confidence the Reserve Bank of Australia had likely ended its rate hiking cycle. Weaker-than-expected inflation data from Wednesday and a stall in retail turnover announced by the ABS on Thursday pushed the benchmark ASX 200 to a near record high of 7698.7 at the close of trade, a 0.5 per cent gain.  The broader All Ordinaries index gained 42.4 points, or 0.54 per cent, to hit 7959.5 while Australia’s technology companies surged 1.47 per cent, or 44.6 points, to close at 3074.5.  The dollar lifted 0.35 per cent by the closing bell to buy US65.18 cents.  Ten of 11 industry sectors ended in the green on Thursday, with only utilities falling of 0.33 per cent.  Real estate, discretionary and tech stocks were the star performers, gaining 1.73 per cent, 1.29 per cent and 0.86 per cent, respectively.  Wednesday’s inflation numbers showed consumer price growth holding steady at 3.4 per cent and eToro market analyst Josh Gilbert said the money markets now expected an interest rate cut to follow.  “Much of the good news came from yesterday’s inflation print which was slightly weaker than expected,” he said. “And then you had retail sales data today that rose but lacked any real oompf, still pretty weak. “It shows the impact we have had from the RBA’s tightening cycle is having the effect on consumers.  “Consumers are beginning to show signs of struggling a little bit, after we have seen a lot of resilience and that adds quite a lot of weight to the view that the Reserve Bank is clearly done with hiking interest rates. “It is just now a question of when we are going to get that first cut.” Bitcoin fever has also gripped traders, with the crypto asset hitting a record high of $98,000. “This feels like the start rather than the end for crypto assets, even as Bitcoin closes in on its all-time high in US dollars,” Mr Gilbert said.  “We’re seeing huge interest in Bitcoin ETFs, which are garnering substantial trading volumes and billions of dollars of inflows.” In corporate news, Harvey Norman jumped 4.4 per cent to close at $4.95 on better than expected earnings.  The company reported an before-tax profit of $289m for the FY24 half-year. Ramsay Health Care boomed 7.2 per cent to hit $54.91 after the company announced a six-month net profit of $758.5m. Mining company South32 rose 4.6 per cent after it announced a potential sale of its NSW metallurgical coal business to a Chinese investment group for $2.5bn.  South32 CEO Graham Kerr said the proposed transaction formed part of the company’s strategy to “reshape” its portfolio towards “commodities critical in the transition to a low-carbon future”.

IG Australia market analyst Tony Sycamore said the benchmark was testing resistance coming from a multi-year trend line going back as far as 2007 and the high reached in January.  “A sustained break above 7780-ish would open up a move towards 7900-8000,” Mr Sycamore said. “On the downside, a sustained break of uptrend support would damage the uptrend from the October 6751-low and warn that a deeper pullback is underway.” Nine of 11 industry sectors finished in the green, with the benchmark supported by the financial sector which added 0.4 per cent as sector heavyweight CBA hit a new record of $119.37, up 0.8 per cent. Rivals ANZ climbed 1 per cent to $29.30, NAB jumped 0.7 per cent to $34.32, and Westpac added 0.2 per cent to $27.

Betashares chief economist David Bassanese said he expected the ASX200 to reach the 8000-mark by year’s end, as the growing chance of a soft landing for the global economy bolstered the outlook for equity markets, including in Australia. “Although the Australian corporate earnings have been going through a soft patch due to a weakened consumer and easing commodity prices, forward earnings should start to recover this year as they begin to factor in the earnings recovery expected in the 2026 and 2025 financial years,” Mr Bassanese said. “Lower bond yields and an improving local and global growth outlook by the second-half of the 2024 financial year should also support the earnings and market outlook.” During Friday’s session, materials stocks were the strongest performers, adding 2 per cent, as iron ore and lithium futures climbed. Sector heavyweight BHP added 2.3 per cent to $44.92, while Pilbara Minerals surged 4.3 per cent to $4.38 and Core Lithium vaulted 14.3 per cent to 24c. Tech stocks, echoing a record breaking session for the tech-dominated Nasdaq composite, lifted by 1.9 per cent, with Xero adding 6 per cent to $134.93. Banks also did much of the heavy lifting.

Australian shares slipped from their record highs on Monday as iron ore miners slipped and fresh inventories data fuelled fears that GDP growth had contracted during the December quarter.  At the close of trading, the benchmark S & P/ASX200 index had retreated 0.1 per cent, or 9.8 points, to 7735.8, while the broader All Ordinaries also fallen 0.1 per cent to 7996.5. Early in trading, the ASX200 reached an intraday high of 7,769.1, before easing after business indicators data, released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, showed private firms inventories slipped 1.7 per cent during the December quarter. JP Morgan economist Tom Kennedy said the figures inferred “a much larger drag on aggregate GDP than anticipated”, but added the fall in inventories would be offset by higher trade and consumption. “We now forecast slightly stronger government spending and net export outcomes,” Mr Kennedy said. The Australian dollar was lower, buying US65.19c. Josh Gilbert, market analyst at eToro, said after equities in Australia and abroad had reached all time highs, there was likely to be a profit taking. “When you’ve got risk-on assets that are all trading at record highs … if we do start to see a pullback, that’s quite healthy,” Mr Gilbert said. Following on from profit season, Mr Gilbert said the focus for investors would increasingly shift back toward the macroeconomic outlook.  “Looking towards inflation, looking towards rates, looking towards the election in the United States, I think there’s a lot of risks in terms of this current rally,” he added.  Four of 11 industry sectors finished in the green with interest rate sensitive real estate stocks the best performers, up 1.3 per cent, as softer than expected US manufacturing data bolstered bets that the Federal Reserve will cut rates before mid-year.

Elsewhere in commodities, iron ore miners weighed on the benchmark as futures on the Singapore exchange for the April contract slipped 0.5 per cent to $US112.65 a tonne.  BHP slipped 1.5 per cent to $44.23, Rio Tinto sank 1.2 per cent to $123.41, and Fortescue fell 3.2 per cent to $25.36. Over the weekend, members of the OPEC+ oil cartel extended voluntary supply cuts through to the end of June in an attempt to shore up prices which have dwindled even as geopolitical tensions have heightened in the Middle East.  Brent crude, the international benchmark, neared $US83.50 a barrel while its US equivalent, West Texas Intermediate was just below $US80 a barrel.

Here’s how they will take on America. Three university drop outs who turned a Bondi idea into a $100m cult food chain have revealed how they plan to crack the US market - with a secret change to their name.  Nic Pestalozzi, Nathan Dalah and Casper Ettelson, the founders of the salad bowl restaurant Fishbowl, opened their first store in Bondi Beach in 2016.  Now, just seven years later, after rocketing past $50m in revenues, the trio are about to open a store at 65 Bleecker St in Manhattan’s NoHo. Speaking exclusively to NCA NewsWire, Mr Pestalozzi, said the close friends figured if they could make it in New York, they could make it anywhere. “New York is the absolute Mecca of retail in the world,” he said. “We debated other cities. We thought, ‘should we go to Los Angeles or should we go to London’?  “But we said, ‘look, if we do that we will still need to prove that we can do New York, whereas if we go straight to New York and we make that work, then the world is your oyster’.” Nic, Casper and Nathan, who is married to glamorous New Zealand model Georgia Fowler, started out with a single shop in Bondi.  The friends wanted to build a brand and product around healthy living and their salad bowls are designed with Japanese, Malaysian, Southeast Asian and Chinese influences. “The Bondi image isn’t something we’ve intentionally tried to convey,” Nic said. “It’s just very much where we started, the brand is who we are and the lifestyle that we lead just has that sort of Australian healthy outdoor feeling. “We want to create an authentic brand experience.” He’s confident the Fishbowl experience will carry over the America, though the name will be changed for American customers to “Thisbowl.” He also reckons the casual bowls can compete in New York’s ultra-crowded food space. “Our product is definitely up to the challenge,” he said.  “We wanted it to be something with maximum appeal and the fact it’s healthy, super fresh, very delicious and at great price points, the product by itself actually has a point of difference in the market in New York in terms of that quick casual healthy bowl market.” Offerings from the menu include a coconut chicken bowl with cabbage, carrot, red onion, coriander, lemon olive oil dressing, crispy shallots and a bowl called the O.G., which offers salmon sashimi or poached chicken with kale, beets, edamame, red onion, roasted sesame dressing, seaweed salad, tobiko, crispy shallots. The bowls are all priced below $20, part of what Nic said was the company’s mission to help people make healthier life choices. The business has expanded rapidly since 2016, with 46 stores now open across Victoria, NSW and Queensland.  “Our fit-out costs are quite significantly lower than typical hospitality fit-out costs,” Nic said. “We have a central kitchen and then we produce all of the food daily and we deliver it to the stores daily, so when we fit out a venue, we’re really paying for a few fridges and the furniture whereas a typical restaurant or a hospitality business is paying for kitchen equipment and they’re almost double the investment just to open one store. “The repayments and the payback period on our stores is quite fast and that allows us to be more profitable and that allows us to open more shops.” Nic said the business had rocketed past $50m in revenues in the past 12 months and would target $100m for 2025, with an expansion rate of about eight new stores a year. “That gives us enough time to train staff, to fund the growth and just to ensure we’re not getting too far ahead of ourselves,” he said.  Global expansion beyond New York is also firmly in mind, but Nic says the team followed a “store one” mentality, or achieving excellence store-by-store rather than thinking about their aspirations too broadly. For the moment, that means cracking America through 65 Bleecker. “I think it’s going to be like the ultimate Fishbowl flagship so we’re really excited,” he said.  “We’re putting a lot of you know hearted soul into this one store.” Fishbowl’s initial expansions were self-funded but private Australian investors have come on board in the past two years. American investors have expressed interest in the business but Nic said the trio wanted to keep it “local” for now. “We say we’re sort of empowering people to make healthier lifestyle choices, so it’s not just about our product,” he said.  “We’ve always tried to build a brand and an experience around the product. “People want to feel better.” A popular soft drink product has been recalled from Coles, Woolies and Dan Murphy’s. Shoppers have described being locked down in Perth’s biggest shopping centre after a terrifying knife incident that left one man with a slash to the face, with two people on the run. A major Aussie retailer has made a green-thumbed move, with an orange twist, that most shoppers are likely to approve of. "},

Reflecting on the record breaking week for local shares, AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said a combination of good economic data, strong earnings on Wall Street and expectations of rate cuts helped buoy equities.  “The combination of lower-than-expected local inflation, increased expectations for RBA rate cuts this year and the positive global lead saw the Australian share market rise to a new record high after languishing for two and half years,” Dr Oliver said.  Dr Oliver said gains led by property, energy, health and consumer staple stocks, had helped the local benchmark finish the week 1.9 per cent higher. “Reflecting the positive signs on inflation and official interest rates, bond yields fell with 10-year yields in Australia falling back below four per cent,” he said.  Interest-rate sensitive real estate and tech stocks were the top performers, adding 3.3 per cent and 3.1 per cent, respectively.

The rally in iron ore miners came even as commodity futures on the Singapore Exchange shed 3.7 per cent to $US126.15 a tonne. Elsewhere in commodities, uranium miners soared as spot prices climbed to $US106.25 per pound, their highest level in more than 15 years, as Kazakhstan’s Kazatomprom trimmed its production outlook.

Buoyed by the big four banks, which soared to record or multi-year highs, Australian shares reset their records to close the week as traders bolstered their bets of rate cuts through the second half of 2024.  The benchmark S&P/ASX200 rallied to an all time intraday high of 7853.1 late in the session before later setting to 7847 — up 1.1 per cent at the closing bell. Meanwhile, the broader All Ordinaries also reset its record, closing up one per cent to 8107.5. The Australian dollar also moved higher against the greenback to buy US66.31c. KCM Trade chief market analyst Tim Waterer said equities had been supported by a risk-on sentiment as investors were beginning to see a “light at the end of the tunnel” regarding looser monetary conditions this year. “It’s been an encouraging week for investors regarding the interest rate outlook … obviously, financials being a very sensitive sector that will be the main beneficiary of the positive conditions on the market today,” Mr Waterer said.  However, an upside surprise on fresh US jobs numbers scheduled for release later tonight could put a dampener on sentiment, he added.  “If we did see a strong result tonight, that could cast some doubt as to whether the Fed could cut rates in June.” Bar industrials, all 11 industry sectors finished in the green, led by financials which rallied two per cent after sector-heavyweight Commonwealth Bank surged 1.8 per cent to $121.45 — a fresh record high. Westpac surged 2.6 per cent to $27.70 — a level not reached since November 2019 — while ANZ added 1.7 per cent to $29.81, which was its highest since August 2018, and NAB rose 2.3 per cent to $35.11 — a nine-year high. The rally in financial stocks came as investor optimism grew over the prospect that the US Federal Reserve would begin slashing interest rates later this year. In testimony to US lawmakers, Fed chair Jerome Power said the central bank was “not far” from being able to ease interest rates as it awaited greater confidence that inflation was returning to its two per cent target. “When we do get that confidence, and we’re not far from it, it will be appropriate to dial back (interest rates),” he told the Senate’s powerful Banking Committee. Shares on Wall Street rallied on the news, with Nasdaq-composite and the S&P500 index adding 1.5 per cent and one per cent, respectively, to both reach record highs.  The US benchmark, the Dow Jones index added 0.3 per cent. Across the Atlantic, European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde indicated it could leapfrog the Fed and cut rates from June after it unveiled fresh projections showing inflation could hit the ECB’s two per cent target by 2025. A sluggish December quarter GDP reading had also buoyed investors’ hopes of RBA rate cuts, Betashares chief economist David Bassanese said. “With GDP numbers this week confirming a soft economic outlook, rate cuts seem firmly on the horizon,” Mr Bassanese said. “Along with strength on Wall Street, we expect the records to keep tumbling for Australian shares with our year-end target of 8000 points likely to be met well ahead of schedule.” In corporate news, Virgin Money vaulted 32.9 per cent to $4.08 after, their biggest intraday gain since the stock was listed in 2016, after it received an all-cash takeover bid from the UK’s Nationwide Building Society worth £2.9bn ($AU5.6bn).  Shares in Ramelius Resources added one per cent to $1.56 as it confirmed it was undertaking due diligence to acquire Canadian-listed gold miner Karora Resources in a deal worth a reported $700m to $1bn. GQG Partners shed 1.8 per cent to $2.20 after it was revealed asset manager Pacific Current Group had sold a four per cent stake in the investment fund worth $257.3mvia a block trade.

The boss of Optus’ network operations has resigned four months after a widespread outage at the telco giant disrupted the lives of millions of Aussies. In a statement the embattled telco confirmed Lambo Kanagaratnam, the managing director of the Optus network, had left the company on Friday. His departure marks the second top-level executive to leave the company following the November 8 blackout that hit about 10 million customers and some 400,000 businesses. Former CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin departed the telco on November 20. Interim CEO Michael Venter said he had the “highest regard” for his abilities and service to Optus, Australia’s second-largest telecommunications provider. “Personally, I have the highest regard for Lambo as someone who consistently demonstrates the characteristics that we all know him for,” he said in a message sent to Optus staff. “He is calm under pressure, approachable, cares deeply about our people and our business and is always professional. “Under his leadership, the Optus Network has been Australia’s fastest 5G network for over three years and now has over 4000 5G sites live across Australia. “He led the acquisition of 25MHz of 900MHz in late 2021 to address Optus’ low band spectrum deficit, which this year will deliver a significantly improved customer experience as well as taking our 5G footprint to a larger customer base. “He was a key member of the team that completed the sale of the ATN tower portfolio for $1.9Bn in 2021. “And looking forward, our partnership with SpaceX to cover 100 per cent of Australia will be a game changer for Optus and our customers.” The Optus website states Mr Kanagaratnam has spent more than 24 years in telecommunications. Prior to joining Optus, Mr Kanagaratnam held several senior roles over a 15-year period with telecom company MTN in Africa and the Middle East. Optus is recovering from two severe breakdowns. In 2022, the company suffered a serious data breach in a cyber hack and on November 8, 2023, a daylong meltdown sent millions offline, crippling businesses and emergency services. South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas threatened to pull contracts with the firm over the blackout. “They have let their customers down throughout the state, including the government,” he said on the day. “And Optus needs to respond swiftly, communicate effectively, with everybody about exactly what is going on here.” Mr Malinauskas said his government would contemplate switching providers after first putting out the fires of the day. “If Optus want to seek government as a customer, they need to be a reliable service in this modern age,” he said. “Telecommunications is critical to the function of government. “We have a contract with Optus, as do other governments around the country. That is something we will turn our mind to.” Optus blamed the failure on changes to “routing information” following a routine upgrade to its systems. “At around 4.05am Wednesday morning, the Optus network received changes to routing information from an international peering network (Singtel internet Exchange) following a routine software upgrade,” Optus said in a statement last year. “There routing information changes propagated through multiple layers in our network and exceeded preset safety levels on key routers which could not handle these.” The statement said the action resulted in routers disconnecting from the Optus IP Core network to protect themselves. Despite netting a $3m pay package over the 2023 financial year, Australia’s highest paid bureaucrat has moved on to the private sector. The vice-chancellor at Australia’s top-ranked university has unexpectedly resigned just months after starting his second term. A Silicon Valley based start-up is set to benefit from hundreds of millions dollars in government-backed loans and capital. "},

The broader All Ordinaries also dropped 12.5 points, or 0.16 per cent, to close at 7847 points. Nine of 11 sectors were in the red when markets closed on Tuesday, with the tech sector faring the worse by dipping by 1.3 per cent.  The financial sector also suffered falling 1.2 per cent after some major banks announced surprising mid yearly results.  Many companies continued to release half yearly results on Wednesday, as reporting season is well and truly in full swing.  The Commonwealth Bank recorded a cash profit of $5bn, which was three per cent lower than previous six month period in 2023. CBA chief executive Matt Comyn said the dip comes off the back of a challenging period marred with cost of living pressures. “The fundamentals of the Australian economy remain strong,” he said. “We recognise though that all households are feeling the impact of higher inflation and higher rates. “Our base case remains a soft landing and we expecting these pressures to ease as inflation and interest rates start coming down later this year.” The announcement resulted in CBA shares falling by 1.86 per cent to $113.84 at the close on Wednesday. Saxo Asia Pacific senior sales trader Junvum Kim said while CBA had a cautious outlook for this year, their higher dividend payout – which was announced on Tuesday would be $2.15 per share – is seen as attractive. “A lower cash profit for CBA on the back of a declining net interest margin – a sub-2 per cent margin flags concerns about lacklustre consumer sentiment amid sticky inflation, in addition to heightened competition,” Mr Kim said.  Meanwhile, AMP recorded a net profit after tax of $196m in the 12 months to December 2023. Despite beating the $184m net profit recorded the year prior, AMP CEO Alexis George said the company faced an operating environment that was “particularly challenging” in 2023.  “AMP’s operating businesses experienced demanding economic conditions, however management held to their clear strategy to focus on the performance of the operating businesses, and maintained a disciplined approach to controlling costs,” Ms George said.  It comes off the back of the latest Jobs and Skills Australia report, national online job ads fell by 2 per cent (or 5200 job ads) in January 2024 to stand at 254,500.  “Despite this, vacancy numbers remain at record levels, with around two-thirds more advertisements in the labour market presently than compared with the monthly average for 2019,” CommSec stated.  The Australian dollar increased by 0.1 per cent to finish at US 64.62c late on Tuesday. On Wall Street overnight, the S & P 500 closed 1.4 per cent lower, while the Dow Jones fell 1.4 per cent.  The concerning plunge comes as traders wait to see what the Federal Reserve will do about inflation.  The US recorded higher-than-expected inflation, which has dashed hopes of the first interest rate cut in March.

Six of 11 sectors rose, with technology increasing one per cent.  JB Hi-Fi boosted 7.13 per cent despite reporting a 19.9 per cent drop in profit compared to this time last year. The tech company’s net profit was $264.3m after it banked $5.16bn in sales over the half year. However, health care slumped 3.2 per cent after CSL announced it would abandon its phase three trial for a drug designed to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events.  CSL fell 4.8 per cent following the announcement.  The decision came as the study “did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint” and there are “no plans for a near-term regulatory filing”, the company reported.  The trial was part of the company’s plan to transform the treatment of heart attack patients.  CSL’s decline accounted for more than three-quarters of the fall in the index. Meanwhile, Beach Energy – which is majority owned by billionaire Kerry Stokes — gained 3.3 per cent and Aurizon added 3.2 per cent after reporting. BHP dropped 0.5 per cent and Rio Tinto lost 0.7 per cent. The Australian dollar fell 0.1 per cent to finish at US65.17c.

The broader All Ordinaries also dropped 12.5 points, or 0.16 per cent, to close at 7847 points. Seven of 11 sectors dropped at the close on Tuesday.

It comes off the back of Monday’s reporting that the biotech company was scrapping phase three trial for a drug designed to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. Despite the setback, CSL handed down its half year result on Tuesday recording a net profit $1.94bn – or an increase of 20 per cent – in its revenue after plasma collection and collection costs were financially viable this season.  “CSL’s share price has come a long way from the October $228.65 low, and last week ran into solid downtrend resistance at $306, from the February 2020 $342.75 high,” market analyst Tony Sycamore said.

It was closely followed by Beach Energy with a 6.7 increase and Emerald Resources on 6.4 per cent.  Meanwhile, NAB’s monthly business survey showed business confidence remained low in January, following a dip in the services sector. “The gradual easing in business conditions continued in January, with the headline conditions index now just below its long-run average,” NAB Chief Economist Alan Oster said. “Both profitability and trading conditions are now below average with conditions supported somewhat by still above-average employment conditions. “The easing in conditions in January was led by a pullback in the services sectors though conditions in retail also remain weak. “Confidence remains weak as it has for some time, consistent with ongoing pressures across the economy with growth clearly slowing in the back half of 2023, and cost growth still high notwithstanding some easing over H2 2023.” The Australian dollar fell 0.17 per cent to finish at US65.19c late on Tuesday.

Eight of 11 sectors were in the green when markets closed on Thursday, with the tech sector outperforming all other sectors after increasing by 6.8 per cent.  It comes as Altium, the ASX’s fourth-biggest tech company, announced it would be acquired by Japan-based Renesas Electronics for $9.1bn.  The good news follows the slew of companies that have released their half yearly reports.  CommSec reported that of the 46 ASX200 companies that have reported earnings, more than 52 per cent have lifted cash levels. “Half have increased dividends, 22 per cent left them steady, 28 per cent have cut dividends (and) only two haven’t paid a dividend,” CommSec reported. Those companies who released their reports on Thursday include Wesfarmers – owners of Bunnings and Officeworks – boosted its profit for 3 per cent to $1.4bn.  Telstra reported a 11.5 per cent rise in half year profit to $1bn. Telstra CEO Vicki Brady said overall momentum was good but the company would look to improve its business as it faces ongoing challenges.  “We have remained disciplined on reducing our costs, particularly considering the external economic environment,” Ms Brady said.  “This discipline during the half delivered $64m core fixed cost out, and cumulatively we’ve delivered $105m since FY22. “While we’re being challenged by cost pressure, we still expect to achieve the large majority of our cost out ambition by the end of FY25.” Telstra shareholders can expect to receive a dividend of 9.0 cents per share.  The Energy sector was the worst performer at the close on Thursday despite ﻿Origin Energy reporting a net profit of $747m for the half year, up from $44m a year earlier. Meanwhile, the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show the seasonally adjusted jobless rate rose to 4.1 per cent in January from 3.9 per cent in the previous month. There’s now 600,600 people unemployed across the country, compared to the 578,300 Aussies were out of work in December. Thursday’s announcement means it’s the first time the unemployment rate has been above 4 per cent since January 2022.

Minerals such as nickel are essential to the energy transition.” Ms King urged the nickel industry to consider the possibility of a substantial structural challenges to ensure its longevity.  “The international nickel price is forecast to stay relatively low through 2024, and likely for several years to come until the surplus of nickel in the market is corrected,” Ms King said. “In the meantime, this puts further Australian nickel operations at risk.” The energy sector also fared well, finishing up 1 per cent higher on Friday.

Superloop said on Monday its board and its advisers had considered Aussie Broadband’s offer but ultimately found it was “opportunistic and fundamentally undervalues Superloop”. “Consequently, the board does not intend to engage with ABB on the indicative proposal,” Superloop said in a statement. The decision to reject the offer proved impressive to shareholders, with shares jumping 14 per cent at the close on Monday.  The offer came after the telco last week announced its half-year results noting it had achieved “another period of strong financial performance”. “The 2024 financial year is the first of our three-year ‘Double Down’ strategy intended to double the revenue in the business while expanding margins and the performance in this first half demonstrates its execution is tracking strongly against this plan,” it said.

The broader All Ordinaries remained the same as it closed on Monday, finishing at 7911 points. Five of 11 sectors were in the red when markets closed on Tuesday, with the materials and energy sector underperforming the lowest, dropping 1.1 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively.  Mining giant BHP was down 1.1 per cent despite the company revealing its half-yearly profit had dropped 86 per to $1.4bn ($US 927m) on Tuesday.  “We expect the lagged impact of global inflation to continue into the second half, particularly in relation to labour, and as we negotiate long-term supply arrangements,” BHP warned in its report.  The company did report a six per cent increase in revenue up to $27.2bn. The mixed report came after the company stated it “had its challenges, with adjustments relating to Nickel West, West Musgrave and Samarco offsetting an otherwise solid operational performance and overall healthy commodity prices”. BHP confirmed it would pay an interim dividend of $1.10, fully franked. Meanwhile, ANZ fell 2.2 per cent following news the big bank won its appeal to block its $4.9bn Suncorp Bank takeover.  The Australian Competition Tribunal on Tuesday set aside an August decision by ACCC to stop the acquisition from going ahead.  “The tribunal is satisfied that the proposed acquisition represents a net public benefit,” Deputy President Justice John Halley said. Meanwhile, market analyst Tony Sycamore said most of Tuesday’s sharemarket movement was reactive of the RBA releasing its February Board meeting minutes.  “With US markets closed overnight for the Presidents’ Day holiday, the ASX 200 was left to its own devices today, taking its lead from earnings reports and a hawkish set of RBA meeting minutes,” Mr Sycamore said.  “The minutes showed that at its February board meeting, the RBA considered two options – hiking rates by 25 basis points or keeping the cash rate on hold at 4.35 per cent.  “The RBA’s decision to leave rates unchanged centred on the observation that the risk of inflation not returning to the board’s target within a reasonable time frame had eased. “Based on the high cost of inflation not returning to target within the envisaged time frame, members agreed that it was appropriate not to rule out a further increase in the cash rate target. “The Australian interest rate market remains uninterested in talk of additional RBA rate hikes and instead has 35 basis points of easing priced for 2024.” The Aussie dollar is trading near US65.28c at the close on Tuesday.

AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said while shares had become “vulnerable” after their surge since last October’s lows, so far any pull backs had been brief and the trend had remained up. “There are still plenty of possible triggers for a correction in shares – rate cut delays, high geopolitical and recession risks and soft seasonality around this time of year. And the enthusiasm around AI is now getting a bit frothy along with general investor sentiment which leaves shares a bit vulnerable to any bad news,” Dr Oliver said. “However, we continue to see the broad trend as up for global and Australian shares this year as rates fall and recession is ultimately avoided or if not then its mild.” In corporate news, Afterpay parent Block vaulted 16.5 per cent to $117.94 on deeper than expected cost cutting measures and a jump in quarterly revenue to $US5.8bn ($8.8bn) trumped analysts’ forecasts. Budget telecommunications provider Aussie Broadband flew 18.6 per cent higher to $4.53 after posting an increase in home internet subscribers in its six-month earnings report.

A new report has revealed increased competition from online retailers and lower priced products help Australia’s inflation crisis from worsening.  The report — titled Surf, Shop, Save: Online retail helps lower costs of living — prepared by Mandala, compared the prices of more than 60,000 products sold online with the Consumer Price Index to understand the effect online retail channels had on inflation.  The report commissioned by Amazon Australia found annual inflation could have been 0.7 percentage points higher at its peak in 2022 if it wasn’t for “cost efficiency” and the “competitive effects of online retail channels”.  The report also revealed lower income households had disproportionately benefited from online retail channels.  The report found savings from reduced handling and improved distribution helped lower the cost of online products and reduced prices throughout the retail sector as a result of increased competition and consumer choice.  According to the report, the average Australian household saved up to $3500 as prices for online goods fell between 2019 and 2023.  The difference between the change in online prices and Consumer Price Index was 10.5 percentage points by December 2023, meaning Aussie households saved the equivalent of three weeks worth of free groceries every year from 2019.  Cost savings among households were largest in the “recreation” and “culture” categories, which include items such as stationary, toys and pet food, where households had saved almost $1000 in the past five years, according to the report.  Report author Adam Triggs said online shopping had helped ease the burden of cost of living on Australians.  “This research indicates online retail may be the unrecognised hero of the inflation crisis,” Dr Triggs said. “Australia faced a perfect storm with supply chain challenges, the war in Ukraine and disruptions to global trade.  “But inflation would have been worse without online sales, which helped drive down prices directly and create competition to ease pressure on offline sales. “Retail is a mix of online and offline channels, and retailers are increasingly blending them to reach consumers. As part of that mix, online channels are having a powerful competitive impact, helping consumers more easily shop around for the best price.” Mr Triggs said without online retail channels, the Reserve Bank would have increased interest rates by a further 0.5 percentage points and subsequently, today’s cash rate would be 4.85 per cent.  “These savings make a real difference to Australians trying to manage household budgets,” he said.

The lacklustre trading day contrasts with a stunning earnings beat at American chip giant Nvidia that looks set to push Wall St higher later on Thursday. Senior financial market analyst at Capital.com Kyle Rodda said corporate Australia’s “mixed bag” of earnings had prevented the market from matching the sparks rippling through Wall St. “It’s really another case that we’re sort of lagging behind our international peers again,” he said. “We’re not seeing a broadbased narrative of strong earnings across the ASX and when you contrast that with what’s happening on Wall St, both from a thematic point of view but also from an earnings perspective, which has been a little bit better than expected, we’re not really participating in that kind of run higher.” Seven sectors ended in the green, with utilities leading with a 2.01 per cent gain.  Energy, IT, industrials, health care, materials and staples also ended in positive territory, while real estate, financials, telecommunications and discretionary fell through the day.  Mining behemoths Rio Tinto and BHP both ended down, 1.14 per cent and 0.38 per cent, respectively, as iron ore prices pull back.

Material stocks were the worst performers, edging 0.2 per cent lower, as a host of miners reviewed their exploration plans as commodity prices sagged.  In corporate news, Liontown Resources was the biggest laggard on the benchmark, plummeting 21.3 per cent to 94c – its lowest level since July 2022 after the lithium miner announced a review of its planned expansion of its Kathleen Valley project.

The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index reset its record intraday high to 7,682.3 points, before finishing slightly lower at 7,680.7, up 1.1 per cent to its highest close on record. After rising for eight consecutive sessions, the ASX200 booked its longest winning streak since August 2021. Meanwhile, the broader All Ordinaries also came within 43.5 points of its record, rising 1 per cent to 7,912.8 Against the greenback, the Australian dollar was sharply lower, falling 0.6 per cent to US65.63c, as bond yields dived on heightened expectations of rate cuts. Fresh inflation data showed consumer price growth eased to 4.1 per cent in the December quarter, down from 5.4 per cent in the quarter prior – and the lowest for two year.  The result was far softer than consensus expectations for a 4.3 per cent rise, and came in under the central bank’s own forecast of 4.5 per cent.  Following the figures, money markets ascribed a 78 per cent chance that the central bank will cut interest rates at its June meeting, and are fully priced for two rate cuts before year’s end commencing in August. Westpac chief economist Luci Ellis said the Reserve Bank would keep the cash rate on hold at its first meeting of the year next week, and it was unlikely to raise rates further this cycle. “Today’s CPI release seals the deal,” she said. Noting the increase in house prices and recent uptick in productivity, Ms Ellis said some of the risks the RBA had identified had “not come to pass”. “We continue to expect the first rate cut no earlier than September.” All 11 of industry sectors finished in the green, led by interest rate sensitive real estate and utilities stocks which added 2 per cent and 1.7 per cent, respectively. Property sector heavyweights rallied with Dexus and Lendlease rising 2.6 per cent to $7.80, and $7.41 respectively. Lifestyle Communities up 1.9 per cent to $18.03. The utilities sector was buoyed by heavyweight Origin Energy which added 2.7 per cent to $8.52, its highest level since November 27. On Monday, the company upped its stake in UK-based renewable energy firm Octopus Energy with an investment of $354.3 million.

Australian shares notched their third consecutive day of gains on Tuesday – their longest winning streak of 2024 – after US stocks rallied to record levels. At the closing bell, the S&P/ASX200 rose 0.5 per cent, or 38.3 points, to 7,514.9, while the broader All Ordinaries also climbed, adding 0.5 per cent to reach 7,742.1. The Australian dollar was higher, buying US65.97c against the greenback, up 0.4 per cent. Josh Gilbert, market analyst at eToro, said after a challenging start to the year, stocks would ultimately benefit from the tailwind of rate cuts, even if the US Federal Reserve didn’t deliver them by March.  “We may start to see some of that rotation to some of those cheaper sectors that are more sensitive to rate cuts and that our view of sort of a soft landing. So that will start to happen as you get sort of closer to those rate cuts,” Mr Gilbert said. “I don’t really see any reason why this market doesn’t have room to keep moving higher.” Locally, eight of 11 industry sectors finished in the green, led by a rally in health care stocks which rose 1 per cent.  Its gains were led by Ansell, up 1.8 per cent to $24.11, while Cochlear added 1 per cent to $301.99, CSL rose .97 per cent to $293.34 and Ramsay Health Care climbed 1.2 per cent to $51.45. Amid reports that Beijing is considering a fresh round of stimulus to help stabilise its slumping stock market, iron ore futures rallied in Singapore to reach $US131.25 a tonne, up 1.8 per cent.  Locally, ASX heavyweight BHP added 1 per cent to $46.30, while Fortescue also finished higher, rising 0.8 per cent to $28.05.  However, without a comprehensive stimulus package, Mr Gilbert said any relief to Chinese stocks would likely be temporary. “Unfortunately, that drip-fed stimulus has really not done what I think policymakers had expected. We’re already starting to see some optimism begin to fade,” he said. On Wall Street overnight, the S&P 500 firmed 0.2 per cent higher to reach a fresh record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent, sailing past the 38,000 points mark for the first time. In corporate news, Arcadium Lithium was the best performer on the benchmark, adding 4.7 per cent to $7.85. Macquarie initiated coverage on the lithium miner with an outperform rating and a price target of $11.  IDP Education plunged 5.9 per cent to $20.77 to be among the biggest laggards.

Viva Energy shares slipped to $3.33, down 0.3 per cent, after providing a trading update for the December quarter. While the company posted a gross refinery margin of $US8.8 a barrel, the firm cited a period of weaker regional margins.  Judo Bank soared 16.6 per cent to $1.09 after its pre-tax profit rose 24 per cent to $67m in the first half, according to unaudited figures. The bank said the result was due to above-system lending growth, strong net interest margins of 3.02 per cent, and minimal write offs. Karoon Energy dipped 4 per cent to $1.79, as it cut its guidance for its Brazilian operations. The firm expects to produce 7.2 to 9 million barrels of oil, down from its previous estimate of 8 to 10 million, owing to operation issues at its Baúna Project. Embattled airline Qantas rose 0.8 per cent to $5.37 as it announced its group executive for corporate affairs, Andrew McGinnes, was leaving the company after nearly 13 years. The national carrier has also appointed Andrew Walduck as its new chief information officer.

In corporate news, a mooted merger between BWP Trust, which owns a number of Bunnings Warehouse businesses, and Newmark Property REIT sent the latter soaring.

Domino’s share price has received a thrashing despite reaching new sales heights as the Australian share market rallied on Thursday to a three-week high.  The S&P/ASX200 closed up Thursday, gaining 36.20 points or 0.48 per cent to 7,555.40, despite mixed trading on Wall Street, with losses offset by strong gains US technology stocks, including Netflix which leapt 10.70 per cent after a subscriber boost.  On Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose added 0.1 per cent and set a record for a fourth day straight while the Nasdaq gained 0.4 per cent.  The Dow Jones fell 0.3 per cent.  The biggest loser in Australia was by far Domino’s Pizza, as the market reacted badly to the announcement yesterday that it had poorly timed its expansion into Japan, Taiwan and Malaysia.  Domino’s shares plummeted 31 per cent to $39.51, despite Australian and New Zealand branches delivering their best sales performance in six years, as a 8.9 per cent drop in same-store sales in Asia saw the brand receive a walloping.  “Domino’s finished 2023 as the fastest growing pizza company in Australia, with marketing reaching new customers through non-traditional media as well as through the global partnership with Uber,” a hopeful trading update began.  Despite expecting the Christmas trading period to “deliver a turnaround in sales performance in Japan”, it was not “sufficient to deliver positive Network Sales for December”.  The big supermarkets have each received a blow to their share price after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the consumer watchdog would conduct a year-long price inquiry into the industry after accusations of gouging.  “The ACCC has significant powers – and it is the best and most effective body to investigate supermarket prices,” Mr Albanese told the National Press Club.  “To look at how things like online shopping, loyalty programs and changes in technology are impacting competition in the industry and to examine the difference between the price paid at the farm gate – and the prices people pay at the checkout.  “For me, it’s this simple. When farmers are selling their product for less, supermarkets should charge Australians less.”  Woolworths has said it would assist the inquiry, noting it expects inflation to “continue to moderate” throughout 2024.  Meanwhile, Coles defended its pricing in a statement released after the announcement, saying that the company is “working hard to keep groceries affordable”.  “We are doing this against a challenging environment of high inflation, with rising costs that affect the whole economy including farmers, suppliers and retailers, and impact the prices customers pay at the checkout. Coles said it had kept its prices below the nation’s rate of inflation for the past four years.  “We have worked closely with the ACCC in previous inquiries, and we will do so again,” the company said. “We welcome the ACCC’s examination of the factors that affect prices in the grocery supply chain and look forward to illustrating how we provide value to our customers and our positive relationships with our supplier partners.” Five of the 11 sectors finished in the red. The materials sector received the largest boost on the share market today with a lift of 1.48 per cent after iron ore futures hit a two week high close to $136 a tonne.  That was led by Rio Tinto which received a 2.80 per cent boost to raise its share price to $132.63, followed by BHP with a 1.45 per cent decrease to $47.54. The bankers were mixed on Thursday, with NAB down 0.25 per cent to $31.79.  Westpac led in terms of gains, up 0.59 per cent to $23.70 followed by ANZ which saw its share price rise 0.30 per cent to $26.67 and Commonwealth up 0.14 per cent to $114.86.

The Australian share market extended its positive run on Monday, notching six consecutive sessions in the green, as energy stocks rose after a re-escalation of tensions in the Middle East. At the closing bell, the S&P/ASX200 rallied 0.3 per cent, or 23 points, to 7,578.4, while the broader All Ordinaries also added 0.3 per cent to 7,808.3 The Australian dollar was higher, rising 0.2 per cent to US65.90c, against the greenback.  Zoran Krescovic, market analyst at EightCap, said traders were showing signs of a “risk-on” sentiment, with investors seeking higher returns.  “Even those [investors] without the actual risk-on equities, are actually jumping on the bandwagon at the moment,” Mr Krescovic said. Energy stocks were the top gainers, rising 1.8 per cent, as Brent crude climbed to almost $US84 a barrel after separate attacks by Iranian-backed Houthi militants killed three US troops stationed in Jordan and a missile struck a Trafigura-operated fuel tanker in the Red Sea. The attacks have reignited fuel supply concerns and stoked fears that crucial shipping lanes through the Red Sea will be further disrupted. Woodside Energy rose 2.3 per cent to $31.91, Santos gained 1.7 per cent to $7.80, while Karoon rallied 2.6 per cent to $1.96. Supporting the sector’s rally was the announcement from the White House on Friday that approvals for new liquefied natural gas projects due to be exported will be paused. Tech stocks were the biggest laggard on the benchmark, slipping 1.2 per cent, as US tech stocks dipped after sector heavyweight Tesla reported worse than expected earnings. In company news, Woolworths was unchanged at $36.19 even as it foreshadowed writedowns worth $974.4m in its 2024 interim results as its New Zealand business faced significant headwinds. Gold Road Resources plunged 18.4 per cent to $1.40, and was the worst performer on the benchmark index, after the miner posted a drop in quarterly gold production alongside a weaker outlook.  Automotive parts retailer Bapcor jumped 5.9 per cent to $5.58, and it forecast higher half-yearly revenue of $1.02bn, compared with $1bn in the second-half of FY2023.  Boss Energy sank 4.5 per cent to $5.33 after analysts at Bell Potter downgraded the uranium exploration company to a “hold” rating.  In overseas markets, the collapse of Chinese property giant Evergrande, which was ordered into liquidation by a Hong Kong court with $US300bn in liabilities, after it was unable to clinch another deal with creditors. The company’s shares, which are listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, tanked 20.9 per cent before trading was suspended. While the liquidation order risked sending “shockwaves” through the Chinese and global markets, Mr Krescovic said the Australian dollar could still trend higher should Chinese demand for commodities remain robust. ”If we do see more stimulus and this Evergrande case is not contagious … then hopefully we can actually see the “Aussie” bounce back and continue its upside run,” he said.

The Australian share market extended its gains on Wednesday for a seventh straight day, it’s longest streak in six months. It went within 2.3 points of its record intraday high of 7,632.8 set in August 2021.  But despite reaching an intraday high of 7,630.5 early in the session, the benchmark erased much of its gains in the afternoon, adding 0.3 per cent, or 21.8 points, to 7,600.2 at the closing bell. The broader All Ordinaries added a similar amount, reaching 7,835. The Australian dollar was trading higher, rising 0.5 per cent to US66.14c, its biggest daily increase since mid-December.  IG Australia market analyst Tony Sycamore said at its intraday peak, the benchmark had recaptured all the ground it lost during its 4 per cent sell-off in January.  “If there was a blemish to be found, the index fell narrowly short of breaking the 7632.8 record high from August 2021, encouraging sellers to step in after lunch,” Mr Sycamore said.  “Whether the ASX200 gets another chance at record highs after tomorrow’s all-important December quarter CPI data remains to be seen.” Seven of 11 industry sectors finished in the green, with tech stocks the standout performers, adding 1.9 per cent, after the US tech-heavy index, the Nasdaq, jumped 1.1 per cent overnight.  Locally, Xero added 1.6 per cent to $110.98, Wisetech rose 1.3 per cent to $72.30 and Macquarie Technology Group added 0.8 per cent to $71.50.  Meanwhile, investors appeared unfazed by fresh retail sales figures, released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Thursday, which showed spending plunged by 2.7 per cent in December. Economists were forecasting a more modest decline of 2 per cent.  In corporate news, Megaport was the top gainer on benchmark, vaulting 27.6 per cent to $12.48 as it posted a 5 per cent jump in revenue over the December quarter to $48.6m.  Shares in Capricorn Metals added 1.5 per cent to $4.63, after the gold producer said production of the precious metal at its Karlawinda Project had reached 30,399 ounces in the December quarter, up from 29,700 ounces in the prior quarter.  Copper and zinc producer Sandfire Resources climbed 3.8 per cent to $7.12. The firm posted quarterly underlying earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortisation of $84m, up from $81m a year earlier.  Nickel Industries rocketed 20.8 per cent to 73c, its best ever intraday gain. The nickel miner reported record output of 34,450 metric tons from its rotary kiln electric furnace for the December quarter. Toll roads operator Atlas Arteria rose 2.2 per cent to $5.47 after booking a 5.9 per cent increase in revenue over the December quarter after a strong performance in its French operations.

New loan commitments for first home buyers fell sharply in the month of December, in the latest sign that more Australians are giving up on the dream of owning their own home as house prices continue to rise to new heights. The total number of first homebuyer loan commitments hit 9491 Australia-wide in December, a sharp 8.4 per cent fall from November.  The value of first homebuyer loans also fell 5.5 per cent to hit $4.8bn.  Though December registered a sharp drop, 2023 in total registered 12.9 per cent growth in the number of first homebuyer loans.  Some states also bucked December’s gloomy figures for first homebuyers, with South Australia recording a 2.6 per cent uptick in the number of new loans. Tasmania and the Northern Territory recorded growth rates above five per cent. But loans collapsed in Queensland, with the Sunshine State recording a substantial 14.1 per cent decline. Victoria and NSW both recorded 3.7 per cent falls.  Master Builders Australia CEO Denita Wawn said the December decline meant first home buyers now accounted for less than one third of housing loans.  “During 2023, first home buyers struggled against the backdrop of larger than expected interest rate increases as well as resurgent house price growth,” she said. “Strong rental price growth has also eaten into their financial capacity and slowed down the process of saving for a home purchase deposit.” The total value of new loan commitments fell 4.1 per cent in the month, with owner-occupier loans falling 5.6 per cent and investors sliding 1.3 per cent. Ms Wawn said December’s figures revealed the “demand side” of the market was beginning to struggle.  “Poor sentiment among owner occupiers resulted in the number of loans for newly built homes declining by 4.9 per cent while existing home loans suffered an 8.2 per cent reduction,” she said on Friday.  “The figures for December highlight the fact that the demand side of the new home building market is struggling at the same time as obstacles on the supply side persist. “The pipeline for new homes is shrinking and not showing assurances that people are able to build new homes.” The peak body CEO noted input costs in the building sector continued to strain supply. “Having stabilised during the September 2023 quarter, there were hopes that building materials costs might have fallen during the December 2023 quarter,” the organisation stated. “The 0.3 per cent increase which occurred during the last three months of 2023 is an unwelcome result and means that building materials are over one third more expensive (33.5 per cent) than before the pandemic. “Combined with continued labour supply pressures, the resumption of building materials price rises is likely to frustrate efforts to expand the stock of new homes.” House prices continue to rise across much of Australia in early 2024, with data from CoreLogic showing a 0.4 per cent rise in January. The median price of a home in Australia now sits at $759,000. Master Builders said December’s “weak” set of lending figures added to the case for an RBA interest rate cut “as soon as possible.” Labor will pour billions more into building new homes in a move welcomed by the housing sector, but slammed by its political opponents.

The share market snapped its eight-day winning streak on Thursday, tumbling from its record-high after it was weighed down by a flurry of profit-taking and Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell all but guaranteed US rates would not be cut in March.  At the closing bell, the benchmark was 1.2 per cent, or 92.5 points, lower to 7.588.2, while the broader All Ordinaries had shed a similar amount to 7,818.8.  The Australian dollar extended its losses, edging 0.2 per cent lower to US65.51c. Wall Street tumbled overnight as traders trimmed their bets that the Fed likely wouldn’t be ready to cut rates in March, as markets were pricing. The S&P 500 dipped 1.6 per cent overnight, its largest decline since September, and the Dow Jones retreated 0.8 per cent.  Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged 2.2 per cent as all of the Magnificent Seven stocks fell into the red, with Alphabet missing analysts’ forecasts. TMS Capital portfolio manager Ben Clark said markets in Australia and the United States were still tightly correlated with the outlook for interest. “Jerome Powell has obviously tried to push back on the expectation that rates are going to get cut in March. He’s still I think trying to keep a grip on inflation and the tight monetary policy they’ve got at the moment,” Mr Clark said. “It’s just a bit of a reality check that governors are still trying to get inflation back under control and maybe rate cuts are a month or two later than the markets are expecting.” US 10-year treasury yields dived 13 basis points to 3.93 per cent.  Locally, all 11 industry sectors were in the red, with financials the worst performing, down 1.8 per cent, following warnings from US and Japanese lenders of their exposure to bad debts in commercial real estate. The ‘big four’ banks all retreated. Commonwealth Bank slid 2.9 per cent to $114.10, NAB sank 2.2 per cent to $31.90, and Westpac dropped 1.7 per cent to $23.77, and ANZ fell 1 per cent to $26.92.  In company news, mixed miner IGO sank 4.2 per cent to $7.24 after it was served a royalty claim by South32 requesting that it pay back royalties worth $122m from its operations at its Tropicana Gold Mine located in WA. IGO announced it will defend the claim. After-pay parent Block fell 2.3 per cent top $100.50 after it foreshadowed redundancies across its operations.  Agricultural chemicals manufacturer Nufarm slumped 1.1 per cent to $5.52 after it announced that challenging conditions across the cropping industry for the first half of 2024 due to excess inventory and higher cost of goods, impact margins.  Automotive parts retailer Bapcor announced Paul Dumbrell as its incoming chief executive and managing director, effective May 1. Its former chief Noel Meehan will step down from the role in coming days. Shares climbed 1.2 per cent to $5.71.

From the legendary Los Angeles Police Department to a Las Vegas school district, one Aussie tech company is on the cusp of a boom with a new virtual reality system that promises to revolutionise policing and STEM education. XReality Group, a small cap ASX-listed company, announced this week it had secured a three-month trial with the LAPD to show off its Operator XR system. The VR headset tech allows police to train in an unlimited number of high-risk and complex scenarios, from plane hostage rescues and building clearances to active shooter emergencies. For Kim Hopwood, XReality’s chief of products and technology, the “big differentiator” with Operator XR is that it permits an end user without technical experience to create an endless array of scenarios and drop in new floorplans and role players within minutes.  “Reality-based training – it’s quite complex and very difficult to recreate real-life scenarios, especially something like an active shooter event because you need a lot of role players,” he told NCA NewsWire. “But in VR, you can recreate those scenarios really easily and add in as many role players as you like. “We’ve designed the system so non-IT people that are your end operators, your tactical operators, can design literally unlimited scenarios. “You can drop in furniture, you can drop in role players … you can role play hostages, and so you can fit over a million different scenarios on a single tablet, and those scenarios can be created by a customer within five minutes.” The company was founded by ex-Australian Special Forces operators and specialist police officers and Mr Hopwood said the design of its VR offering flowed from real-world experience rather than from “geeks” trying to imagine what might work for the law-enforcement and military markets. “We can integrate into an operational weapon, like an M4 or AR-15 rifle,” Mr Hopwood said. “We can take out all the working parts of that rifle – it renders the rifle inert but allows the user to train on their own weapon, which we then track in VR and drop in some equipment into it that allows it to recoil so it feels realistic, and for specialist units, that is quite important because they will all have their weapons configured differently, with different laser set-ups, light set-ups, different optics and even different triggers. So all of that is of great importance to the military and tactical police customer, which is why LAPD Swat was really interested in it.” A team from XReality flew to Los Angeles in September last year to showcase the tech and the three-month trial kicks off this month.  Martin Beck from LAPD Swat said his officers were “looking forward” to training with the new system.  “This trial will help us understand how technology can complement our current training programs and enhance the public safety outcomes,” he said. Mr Hopwood said the “mixed reality” world of the virtual and the real would deliver a slew of safety gains for the public and the police.  “A big focus of the system is helping officers de-escalate scenarios,” he said. “It’s quite difficult for younger police officers to be exposed to high-risk and stressful scenarios, and when they are in those situations for the first time, it is much better to be in those scenarios in VR to be able to learn, to get exposure to those scenarios, so they can be prepared to make the right decisions in the real world.” The Sydney-based $17m company counts Western Australian Police as a major customer and Mr Hopwood said the company would focus its expansion plans on the US law-enforcement market, with a US-based team of five already crisscrossing the country to show off Operator XR to prospective customers.  “The US is our focus, just because of the scale, not only in the population, but the way that the agencies are designed over there,” he said.  “There are 18,000 police agencies in the US because they are organised by city and county as well as at state and federal levels.” A sheriff’s office in Colorado has taken up the system and Mr Hopwood said a school district in Clark County Nevada, which houses Las Vegas, used the company’s tech to train students in crime scene analysis. “We can place forensic evidence on the ground, or the walls, be it blood, tyre tracks, DNA evidence, shell casings, so the students can do that themselves or the teacher can design the scenarios themselves and then the students can go around and learn in this interactive environment,” he said.  “That is going to unlock a whole new market for us as well.” The release of Apple’s Vision Pro headset suggests mixed reality could soon enter the mainstream and it’s something Mr Hopwood expects to happen.  “Everything is moving towards a mixed reality environment,” he said.  “Look at the Apple Vision Pro … the concept of that is you can interact with the real world but then also overlay a virtual world. “Being able to blend real and virtual is just going to get more and more integrated.” As tension grows about the major potential for AI to spark mass job losses, a new humanoid robot has just been unveiled – and it can cook.
