The FTSE 100 index ended down 45.56 points, 0.6%, at 8,121.20. The FTSE 250 fell 27.61 points, 0.1%, at 20,194.47, while the AIM All-Share slipped 0.81 of a point at 764.37. The Cboe UK 100 fell 0.7% to 808.01, the Cboe UK 250 declined 0.5% to 17575.03, and the Cboe Small Companies closed little changed at 16,918.39. In European equities on Tuesday, the CAC 40 in Paris fell 0.3%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt slipped 0.8%. In Europe, investors weighed latest inflation figures and ongoing uncertainty over the outcome of the election in France on Sunday. According to Eurostat, annual consumer price inflation in the single currency bloc eased to 2.5% in June, from 2.6% in May. The figure landed in line with FXStreet cited consensus. On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.2% in June from May. They had risen at the same pace in May from April. Core inflation was hotter-than-expected, however. The yearly core inflation rate was steady at 2.9%, but had been expected to ease to 2.8%. ‘Nothing in these figures would make the ECB cut again in July, and we think it’ll be eagerly awaiting data over the summer before seriously debating a next rate cut in September,’ analysts at ING commented. Supporting this view, ECB President Christine Lagarde told a central banking conference in Sintra, Portugal, the central bank doesn’t yet have sufficient evidence that inflation threats have passed. ‘We are still facing several uncertainties regarding future inflation, especially in terms of how the nexus of profits, wages and productivity will evolve and whether the economy will be hit by new supply-side shocks,’ Lagarde said. Speaking at the same conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the latest economic data suggest inflation is getting back on a downward path, but added officials would like to see more evidence before lowering interest rates. ‘Because the US economy is strong and the labor market is strong, we have the ability to take our time and get this right,’ Powell said, adding ‘that‘s what we’re planning to do.’ The strength of the economy was reflected in robust job vacancy figures, reported on Tuesday. On the last business day of May, the number of job openings was 8.1 million, up from a revised 7.9 million in April, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The figure beat the FXStreet consensus for a drop to 7.9 million. April’s figure was revised down by 140,000. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed. The S&P 500 was up 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.3% higher. In London, markets continue to gear up for the UK general election on Thursday. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak insisted the outcome of the election is not a ‘foregone conclusion’ and that he was ‘feeling energised’ with two days of campaigning to go. Nonetheless, Labour’s opinion poll lead over the Tories has hovered around the 20-point mark for most of the election campaign and the Tory strategy has shifted towards preventing bleeding votes to Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats, and saving as many MPs as possible to form an effective opposition. The pound was quoted at $1.2678 late Tuesday afternoon, up from $1.2639 at the time of the London equities close Monday. The euro firmed at $1.0735, up from $1.0723. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥161.54, down from JP¥161.58. In France, far-right leader Marine Le Pen said her Rassemblement National party will seek allies in parliament to secure an outright majority and form a government if the election results leave it short of the required number of seats. It marks a change from RN’s previous position that it would only take the premiership and reins of government if voters gave it an outright majority of 289 out of 577 votes. ‘We want to govern, to be extremely clear. And if we are a few deputies short of the majority...we will go see others and say: are you ready to participate with us?’ Le Pen told France Inter Radio. Candidates in France face a Tuesday deadline to register for the run-off round, of as President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist camp and a left-wing alliance scramble to prevent the far-right from taking power. In London’s FTSE 100, Sainsbury fell 2.9% after strong food trading was overshadowed by a drop in sales at Argos. For the 16 weeks to 22 June 2024, its first-quarter, total sales rose 4.2% on-year. Grocery sales alone rose 4.8%. Sainsbury’s said total retail sales, excluding fuel, rose 2.6%, while like-for-like sales climbed 3.0%. The like-for-like measure also excludes fuel. Away from grocery, the picture was less bullish for the firm. General Merchandise & Clothing sales were down 4.3%. Argos sales fell 6.2%. 3i enjoyed better fortunes, rising 2.0%, helped by positive comments from Citi. The broker raised its share price target for 3i to 3,800 pence per share from 2,650p. In the FTSE 250, Quilter fell 3.6% after Deutsche Bank downgraded to ’sell’ from ’hold’ ahead of first half results on August 7. The broker expects the dividend to be held flat, which is below current consensus. On AIM, Shoe Zone plunged 12% after it cut profit guidance for the second time in three months blaming rising shipping costs and weak spring sales. As a result, the shoe retailer now expects adjusted pretax profit for the financial year ending October 2 to be not less than £10.0 million. In May, it had lowered its profit forecast to £13.8 million from £15.2 million. In financial 2023, the company reported pretax profit of £16.2 million. Nanoco slumped 26% after it warned delayed receipt of an order would see sales fall short of consensus forecasts Nanoco said the delay was for a further production order for its first generation sensing products. This is no longer expected in financial 2024. The company said it is working with the customer to understand ‘the range of possible outcomes and any potential impact on Nanoco beyond the end of the financial year’. Sales are expected to be marginally below consensus forecasts and adjusted earnings towards the lower end of expectations. Brent oil was quoted at $86.99 a barrel late Tuesday afternoon, up from $86.18 late Monday. Gold fetched $2,327.03 an ounce, down slightly from $2,327.85. Copyright 2024 Alliance News Ltd.

Investors were already braced for such news after the company referenced the issue in March and warned of the impact on earnings at the half-year results in May. It is the scale of the latest downgrade which seems to have spooked investors, with the shares falling 17% to 126.9p taking year-to-date losses to 47%. UNSEASONAL WEATHER ADDS TO WOES In a brief  , Shoe Zone said the company had experienced ‘weaker than expected Spring/Summer sales from April to June due to unseasonal weather conditions.’ Consequently, the retailer now expects pre-tax profit for the year to 2 October 2024 to be not less than £10 million. At the half year results, management lowered its full-year profit forecast to £13.8 million from £15.2 million. Since the end of April, container shipping costs have almost doubled to $5,318 according to the Drewry World Container index, reflecting increasing tensions in the Middle East and disruptions to traffic through the Suez Canal. Other retailers which rely on similar trade routes will no doubt be facing the same headwinds as they look to build inventories for the Autumn and Christmas seasons. EXPERT VIEW AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould commented: ‘Perhaps the most significant takeaway from the downbeat guidance was the flagged increase in shipping costs, with upward pressure on container prices thanks to the reroute away from the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. ‘Shoe Zone’s warning also dragged down LED lighting specialist Luceco, another big importer of product from overseas. ‘It is a reminder that inflationary pressures remain in the global economic system which may have wider implications than tripping up Shoe Zone. It also means investors will be closely monitoring companies with global supply chains to see if they are experiencing a similar impact.’ Disclaimer: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in the article owns Shares magazine.

Investors were also looking to Thursday’s general election and the prospect of a Labour win with the party promising in its manifesto to build 1.5 million new homes during the next parliament. Shares in  Barratt Developments  ( )  rose 7p or 1.5% to 479p while  Taylor Wimpey  ( )  shares rose 2p or 1.4% to 144p. PRICES RISING BUT ACTIVITY MUTED House prices were ‘broadly stable’ in June according to the Nationwide, with the average price up 1.5% compared with a year ago and the average house valued at £266,000, the highest level for 12 months but still slightly below the market peak in the summer of 2022 before rising interest rates impacted sentiment. Housing market activity has been broadly flat over the last year with the total number of transactions still around 15% below 2019 levels. Deals involving mortgages are down nearly 25% on 2019 levels as buyers struggle with high mortgage rates, while the volume of cash transactions is actually slightly higher than it was pre-pandemic. ‘While earnings growth has been much stronger than house price growth in recent years, this hasn’t been enough to offset the impact of higher mortgage rates, which are still well above the record lows prevailing in 2021 in the wake of the pandemic’, observed Nationwide’s chief economist Robert Gardner. ‘As a result, housing affordability is still stretched. Today, a borrower earning the average UK income buying a typical first-time buyer property with a 20% deposit would have a monthly mortgage payment equivalent to 37% of take-home pay - well above the long run average of 30%.’ LABOUR TO UNBLOCK THE MARKET? Many in the housing sector are hoping a Labour win will mean an end to the lengthy planning procedure and the removal of barriers to building new homes and even new towns. In June, the party unveiled its plan to bring back national and local housing targets – which were scrapped by the current government – and reform the planning system ‘in favour of sustainable development’ to deliver the equivalent of 300,000 new homes per year. Tougher requirements on affordable housing numbers would also be mandated with the party promising to ‘deliver the biggest increase in social and affordable housebuilding in a generation’. All of which is music to the ears of the developers – and by extension shareholders – as it means they can start to think about increasing their output once again. You can opt out at any time."},

Short sellers pay a fee to borrow shares from existing shareholders and sell them with the aim of buying them back at a lower price at some point in the future. The  Times  reported that disclosures to the Financial Conduct Authority  show JP Morgan had amassed a short position equivalent to 0.51% of Raspberry Pi's issued share capital. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell has highlighted the timing of JP Morgan’s move: ‘What’s odd is the point at which JPMorgan opened its short position. Its short against Raspberry Pi was made on 25 June, which is after the initial pullback happened in the share price. In effect, it is betting against the current up-trend in the stock which implies it might have concerns about the business or its valuation.’ WHY SHORT NOW? JP Morgan’s reasoning could be something to do with risks highlighted in the company's prospectus. For example, future supply chain disruption which could push costs up or restrict component availability, factors which could lead to customers having to pay more for its kit. Raspberry Pi is also heavily reliant on a handful of partners, principally  Broadcom (AVGO:NASDAQ)  as a component supplier and  Sony (SONY:NYSE)  as its biggest manufacturer. Any breakdown with these relationships could be damaging. FLYING START On 13 June, the company made on the London Stock Exchange with its IPO (initial public offering) priced at 280p, the top end of the range. The shares surged 30% higher to 360p, valuing the company at nearly £700 million. Having reached 440p in the days after the IPO the shares drifted lower before making steady progress. The company founded by chief executive Eben Upton in 2012 with the premise of ‘making computing more accessible to young people’. Raspberry Pi designs and develops low-cost SBCs (single board computers) and computer models for industrial customers, enthusiasts, and educators around the world. The Cambridge-headquartered company also entered the semiconductor market in early 2021 with the launch of its first semiconductor product, the RP2040 microcontroller.

The FTSE 100 index was up 24.91 points, or 0.3%, at 8,189.06. The FTSE 250 was up 74.56 points, or 0.4%, at 20,360.19, and the AIM All-Share was up 1.46 points, or 0.2%, at 765.84. The Cboe UK 100 was up 0.2% at 815.04, the Cboe UK 250 was up 0.6% at 17,732.61, and the Cboe Small Companies was up 0.1% at 16,871.51. The main focus of the week in Europe is politics, notably in the UK and France. On Sunday, Marine Le Pen’s far-right party won the first round of voting, although its share of the vote was around 2 percentage points below that predicted by opinion polls. Le Pen’s Rassemblement National came top with 33.2%, ahead of the left-wing New Popular Front on 28% and President Emmanuel Macron‘s Ensemble alliance on 22.4%. ‘The result is probably better than feared, but not as good as the status three weeks ago pre-elections,’ said Jefferies economist Mohit Kumar. The UK also has its own election to contend with, with Brits heading to polling stations on Thursday. ‘A Labour win is seen as a net positive for financial markets, and would benefit banks, homebuilders and groceries the most according to JPMorgan. A Labour [win] should also benefit the British pound in the long run on hope of improved relations with Europe post-Brexit. In the short run, however, a Labour win is broadly priced in. Therefore the return of the Bank of England doves following the election could keep the pound’s upside potential limited,’ said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. The pound was quoted at $1.2669 at midday on Monday in London, up compared to $1.2639 at the equities close on Friday. The euro rose to $1.0748, against $1.0713. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥161.13, rising from JP¥160.88. In European equities on Monday, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 1.5%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was up 0.4%. Manufacturing activity continued to contract in the eurozone, albeit at a slower pace than expected, data published by S&P Global showed Monday. The HCOB eurozone manufacturing PMI declined to 45.8 in June from May’s 14-month high of 47.3. This however outperformed the flash estimate of 45.6 posted on June 21. Falling further from the 50-mark separating growth from contraction, it indicates that the slowdown in activity accelerated. The UK manufacturing sector continued to grow in June, but at a slower rate, data showed. The seasonally adjusted S&P Global UK manufacturing purchasing managers’ index registered 50.9 in June, down slightly from May’s 22-month high of 51.2 and below the earlier flash estimate of 51.4. The PMI has posted above the neutral 50.0 mark – signalling expansion – in each of the past two months. Numbers showed UK house prices climbed. The Nationwide tracker showed a 0.2% increase in seasonally adjusted UK house prices in June, following a 0.4% climb a month earlier. Annually, the house price index rose by 1.5%, picking up speed from 1.3% in May. ‘Although house prices rose slightly in June, an earlier dip means they were flat on the quarter in Q2. With signs mortgage rates are causing demand to falter and that supply is improving, we think that house prices will flatline at best over the coming months,’ said Andrew Wishart at Capital Economics. London’s housebuilders got a boost on the back of the data. Taylor Wimpey was up 1.8%, while Persimmon and Barratt Developments each jumped 1.9%. On the other hand, Anglo American fell 2.4%. The miner suspended production at Grosvenor steelmaking coal mine in Queensland, Australia following an underground gas incident over the weekend. Anglo American said it will provide steelmaking coal production guidance ‘once more information is available’, and indicated that assessment of the incident may take several months as a result of the likely damage underground. It suspended production at its Grosvenor, following an underground coal gas ignition incident on Saturday. On London’s AIM, Echo Energy jumped 13%. It said its wholly owned subsidiary, Echo Natural Resources, has entered into a shareholders joint venture agreement in Peru with the founding partners of Boku Resources. Stocks in New York were called higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was called up 0.2%, the S&P 500 index up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite fractionally higher.

However, a slowdown in total like-for-like sales growth and the resulting lack of an upgrade saw the shares drop 10p or 4% to a three-month low of 247p. WEAKNESS IN GENERAL MERCHANDISE For the 16 weeks to 22 June, Sainsbury’s posted ‘strong sustained grocery momentum’ with sales up 4.8%, in line with the till-roll data for the period provided by consultants Kantar. Volume growth remained strong as food-price inflation eased, with the firm claiming it had the biggest market share gains of any grocer during the quarter as more customers chose it for their main shop. However, sales of clothing and general merchandise were more mixed with a positive result in clothing more than offset by weak sales at Argos, where revenue was down 6.2% excluding the impact of store closures in the Republic of Ireland (including closures the drop was 7.7%). As a result, total like-for-like sales excluding fuel were up just 3% compared with 4.8% in the previous quarter and 9.8% in the same period last year when high prices drove up the value of the goods it sold. Chief executive Simon Roberts   himself ‘pleased with our market-beating grocery performance and the early progress against our Next Level plan’. ‘We are laser focused on delivering the best combination of value and quality in the market and our customers are recognising that with 98% of big baskets including Nectar Prices or Aldi Price Match’, added Roberts. EXPERT VIEWS Tying in the June data from the British Retail Consortium, which showed shop prices rising just 0.2% last month, UBS chief economist Paul Donovan questioned whether profit-led inflation was over for retailers. ‘Profit-led inflation occurs when retailers use a dominant narrative to disguise profit increases when raising prices. However, at some point, price increases become the dominant narrative and consumer rebellion defeats margin expansion. ‘The collapse in inflation in the US, the UK and Europe has been miraculous, but cost of living remains a politically toxic subject. Consumers focus on price levels, especially for high-frequency purchases, and the ending of margin expansion may slow inflation without lowering prices to levels consumers believe to be “fair”.’ Jefferies analyst Frederick Wild was more upbeat about Sainsbury’s despite the lack of upgrades to the outlook. ‘An exceptionally strong grocery performance in Q1 was diluted by a more downbeat delivery in the general merchandise businesses, particularly Argos. This should represent the trough, which feels well understood by the market given the shares' recent underperformance. ‘Sunnier weather in recent weeks should underpin sequential acceleration, with the chief drivers through the rest of the year an improving consumer environment and an easing comparison.’ You can opt out at any time."},

In addition,  Imfinzi  plus chemotherapy followed by  Imfinzi  alone has been recommended for patients with mismatch repair deficient disease. These patients have an inability to correct DNA replication errors, resulting in increased risk of cancer. The shares traded 0.4% lower at £123.06 reducing the year-to-date gains to 14% compared with a 6% gain in the FTSE 100 index. STRONG EFFICACY The recommendations follow positive results from the DUO-E phase three trials where both regimes demonstrated ‘statistically significant’ and ‘clinically meaningful’ improvement in progression-free survival compared with chemotherapy alone. Data from the trials showed improvements of 43% improvement and 58% respectively for the two regimes versus the current standard of care. Susan Galbraith, vice president of oncology research at AstraZeneca commented: ‘Today's recommendation for approval in the EU recognises the potential of the  Lynparza  and  Imfinzi  combination to provide clinical benefit for patients with endometrial cancer, especially for those with mismatch repair proficient disease who have few available treatments today. ‘If approved, patients in Europe will have a new option for combination treatment that brings the additional benefit of PARP inhibition to immunotherapy.’ Regulatory   for  Imfinzi  and  Lynparza  are currently under review in Japan and several other countries, based on the DUO-E late-stage trial. Endometrial cancer is the fourth most-common cancer in women across Europe with 125,000 diagnoses and more than 30,000 deaths in 2022 according to the World Health Organisation. Separately, AstraZeneca said its Covid-19 prevention drug  Sipavobart  has been granted a ‘fast track’ application in the EU, based on positive results from a late-stage trial which showed the drug reduced the risk of infection for immunocompromised patients.

However, it noted it made the biggest market share strides in the grocery industry in recent weeks. The supermarket chain said total sales in the 16 weeks to June 22, its first quarter, rose 4.2% on-year. Grocery sales alone rose 4.8%. Sainsbury’s said total retail sales, excluding fuel, rose 2.6%, while like-for-like sales climbed 3.0%. Like-for-like sales growth eased from 4.8% in the fourth-quarter. Away from grocery, the picture was less bullish for the firm. General Merchandise & Clothing sales were down 4.3%. Argos sales fell 6.2%. Wizz Air dropped 1.5%. It reported a decline in passenger numbers in June, with the budget carrier noted some aircraft were ‘grounded due to GTF engine inspections’. The GTF engine is made by manufacturer Pratt & Whitney, whose customers include plane maker Airbus. Wizz Air said June capacity rose 0.4% on-year to 5.8 million seats. Passenger numbers fell 0.2% to 5.3 million. Its load factor shrank to 91.7% from 92.2% a year earlier. On a rolling 12-month basis, however, capacity was 14% higher, passengers numbers up 15% and the load factor improved to 90.1% from 89.4%. For the whole of the first-quarter of its financial year, seat capacity rose 0.7% year-on-year, with passenger numbers up 0.5%, Wizz Air said. Wizz Air’s financial year runs to March. ‘Airbus updated the market on its revised manufacturing output on 25 June 2024. While the airline’s long-term growth plan remains unchanged, Wizz anticipates that this could impact the scheduled fleet program in the coming years, as previously indicated,’ Wizz Air added. Retailer Shoe Zone warned on profit, as it cautioned it is still grappling with ‘cost pressures associated with container prices’. The stock slumped 16%. Shoe Zone, which said the cost climb is due to a fall in the supply of shipping vessels and the continuation of a reroute away from the Suez Canal, now expects adjusted pretax profit for the year to October 2 of ‘not less than £10.0 million’.

Craneware provides software solutions that help hospitals and other healthcare providers discover and optimise assets to improve clinical outcomes and financial performance. WHAT WILL THE TIE-UP ACHIEVE? The tie-up will see Craneware use Microsoft’s Azure platform, AI (artificial intelligence) led initiatives, advanced analytics and cloud capabilities to improve their existing offering to customers in the US healthcare market. As part of the agreement, Craneware’s  Trisus  platform and select  Trisus  offerings will be available on Microsoft Azure’s marketplace. The first  Trisus  applications to be made available on the marketplace will be the  Trisus chargemaster  - an automated charge description master management solution,  Trisus decision support  - a business intelligence system that merges financial clinical and operational data and  Trisus labour productivity  - a staff management tool. Craneware has also signed a MACC (Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment) which will make its cloud spend more predictable and provide financial planning benefits, which should create cost efficiencies. EXPERT VIEW Analysts at Berenberg are positive about Craneware’s tie-up but says it is ‘clearly too early to quantify any impact on Craneware's financial profile,’ however ‘the partnership is undoubtedly a positive development.’ ‘Alongside improving end-market dynamics and the opportunity from third-party partner applications, today's announcement of the near-term and potential future benefits to Craneware's product offering and distribution capabilities support our conviction that Craneware is well-placed to capitalise on the shift in US healthcare delivery to value-based care,’ they said in a research note.

The FTSE 100 index ended up slightly at 8,166.76. The FTSE 250 fell 63.95 points, 0.3%, at 20,222.08, while the AIM All-Share climbed 0.80 points, 0.1%, to 765.18. The Cboe UK 100 rose marginally to 813.97, the Cboe UK 250 rose 0.2% to 17,654.04, and the Cboe Small Companies closed up 0.4% at 16,919.99. In European equities on Monday, the CAC 40 in Paris jumped 1.5%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt added 0.5%. The bounce in France came in the wake of results from the first round of legislative election. On Sunday, Marine Le Pen’s far-right party won the first round of voting, although its share of the vote was around 2 percentage points below that predicted by opinion polls. Le Pen‘s Rassemblement National came top with 33.2%, ahead of the leftwing New Popular Front on 28% and President Emmanuel Macron’s Ensemble alliance on 22.4%. ‘The result is probably better than feared, but not as good as the status three weeks ago pre-elections,’ said Jefferies economist Mohit Kumar. A second round of voting will take place on Sunday, with analysts suggesting that a hung parliament is likely. In the UK, opinion polls continue to point to a sizeable majority for the opposition Labour Party. Labour leader Keir Starmer said he would face a ‘difficult inheritance’ and would need to do ‘tough things’ if he becomes prime minister later this week. He acknowledged that after ‘14 years of failure’, he would not be able to ‘get a chequebook out on the Friday after the election’ to boost funding for local services. While Prime Minister Rishi Sunak evoked the late drama of England’s win at Euro 2024 to suggest ‘it’s not over until it’s over’. Investors were also weighing up the latest figures on the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing activity continued to contract in the eurozone, albeit at a slower pace than expected, data published by S&P Global showed. The HCOB eurozone manufacturing PMI declined to 45.8 in June from May’s 14-month high of 47.3. This however outperformed the flash estimate of 45.6 posted on June 21. Falling further from the 50-mark separating growth from contraction, it indicates that the slowdown in activity accelerated. In the UK, the manufacturing sector continued to grow in June, but at a slower rate, data showed. The seasonally adjusted S&P Global UK manufacturing purchasing managers’ index registered 50.9 in June, down slightly from May’s 22-month high of 51.2 and below the earlier flash estimate of 51.4. The PMI has posted above the neutral 50.0 mark – signalling expansion – in each of the past two months. Elsewhere, numbers showed UK house prices climbed. The Nationwide tracker showed a 0.2% increase in seasonally adjusted UK house prices in June, following a 0.4% climb a month earlier. Annually, the house price index rose by 1.5%, picking up speed from 1.3% in May. ‘Although house prices rose slightly in June, an earlier dip means they were flat on the quarter in Q2. With signs mortgage rates are causing demand to falter and that supply is improving, we think that house prices will flatline at best over the coming months,’ said Andrew Wishart at Capital Economics. The news boosted housebuilders with Persimmon up 1.5%, Barratt Developments up 2.4% and Taylor Wimpey up 1.2%. The pound was quoted at $1.2639 late Monday afternoon, unchanged from $1.2639 at the time of the London equities close Friday. The euro firmed at $1.0723, up from $1.0713. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥161.58, up from JP¥160.88. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were little changed, while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.3% higher. US manufacturing sector data painted a mixed picture for the month of June, results from a pair of surveys showed Monday. The latest S&P Global US manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to 51.6 points in June, a three-month-high, from 51.3 in May. However, the June reading was just shy of the 51.7 flash estimate. But, data from the Institute for Supply Management suggested the US manufacturing sector remained in decline. The ISM manufacturing PMI fell to a tally of 48.5 in June, from 48.7 points in May. It is the third-successive contraction in the sector, according to the ISM measure. The PMI landed below the FXStreet cited consensus of 49.1 points. ‘US manufacturing activity continued in contraction at the close of the second quarter. Demand was weak again, output declined, and inputs stayed accommodative,’ ISM analyst Timothy Fiore commented. ‘While the ISM has not been a good leading indicator of GDP growth in recent years, the weak reading adds to evidence that momentum is softening,’ Olivia Cross at Capital Economics said. In London’s FTSE 100, Centrica rose 1.4% after Berenberg upgraded to ’buy’ from ’hold’. ‘Centrica’s strong balance sheet, with nearly £3 billion of net cash, continues to afford it optionality, which leads us to a more constructive view of the investment case,’ analysts at Berenberg wrote. But Anglo American fell 2.8% after it suspended production at the Grosvenor steelmaking coal mine in Australia. Analysts at Citi said the procedures towards reopening of the mine will likely ‘takes months’ and it is likely the 1.2 million tonnes of production planned in the second half of 2024 will be lost. ‘More importantly, [Anglo American] is currently running the process for divestment of the steel making coal business and a major incident at an asset that accounts for close to a quarter of the production could impact the timing/value outcome of the process,’ it added. Among small caps, Pharos Energy PLC jumped 15% after appointing Katherine Roe as its new chief executive officer. Roe has over 20 years of senior corporate, industry and capital markets experience and most recently served as the CEO of Wentworth Resources. On AIM, Westminster Group climbed 6.1% after agreeing a £1.5 million convertible loan note facility with Pantheon A Family Office Ltd. Chief Executive Peter Fowler said the firm was ‘delighted’, to secure this funding from the investor who has been ‘extremely supportive’ of Westminster’s business model. Brent oil was quoted at $86.18 a barrel late Monday afternoon, up from $84.84 late Friday. Gold was quoted at $2,327.85 an ounce, up slightly from $2,326.14. Copyright 2024 Alliance News Ltd.

The CAC 40 in Paris was outperforming other major indices in Europe, amid news that the far right secured a lead in the first round of polling in France. The FTSE 100 index opened up 30.00 points, 0.4%, at 8,194.12. The FTSE 250 was up 120.42 points, 0.6%, at 20,406.45, and the AIM All-Share was up 2.52 points, 0.3%, at 766.90. The Cboe UK 100 was up 0.2% at 815.57, the Cboe UK 250 was up 0.8% at 17,761.94, and the Cboe Small Companies was up 0.1% at 16,870.94. In European equities on Monday, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 2.8%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was up 1.0%. The main focus of the week in Europe is politics, notably in the UK and France. French voters propelled the far-right National Rally to a strong lead in first-round legislative elections on Sunday and plunged the country into political uncertainty, according to polling projections on Sunday. French President Emmanuel Macron, who called the surprise elections just three weeks ago, urged voters to rally against the far right in the second round of balloting. French far-right leader Marine Le Pen called on voters to give the National Rally an ‘absolute majority’ at parliament. The UK also has its own election to contend with, with Brits heading to polling stations on Thursday. ‘A Labour win is seen as a net positive for financial markets, and would benefit to banks, homebuilders and groceries the most according to JP Morgan. A Labour [win] should also benefit to the British pound in the long run on hope of improved relations with Europe post-Brexit. In the short run, however, a Labour win is broadly priced in. Therefore the return of the Bank of England (BoE) doves following the election could keep the pound’s upside potential limited,’ said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. The pound was quoted at $1.2671 early on Monday in London, higher compared to $1.2639 at the equities close on Friday. The euro stood at $1.0758, up against $1.0713. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥161.05, higher compared to JP¥160.88. Also on Monday, investors are digesting the latest Nationwide house price index data. The Nationwide house price index showed a 0.2% increase in seasonally adjusted UK house prices in June, following a 0.4% jump a month earlier. In June, the average UK house price stood at £266,604, compared to £264,249 in May. Annually, the house price index rose by 1.5%, picking up speed from 1.3% in May. ‘Although house prices rose slightly in June, an earlier dip means they were flat on the quarter in Q2. With signs mortgage rates are causing demand to falter and that supply is improving, we think that house prices will flatline at best over the coming months,’ said Andrew Wishart at Capital Economics. London’s housebuilders got a boost on the back of the data. Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon were both up 1.5%. Barratt Developments jumped 1.7%. On the other hand, Anglo American took a hit early Monday, falling 3.6% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 index. The miner suspended production at Grosvenor steelmaking coal mine in Queensland, Australia following an underground gas incident over the weekend. Anglo American said it will provide steelmaking coal production guidance ‘once more information is available’, and indicated that assessment of the incident may take several months as a result of the likely damage underground. It suspended production at its Grosvenor, following an underground coal gas ignition incident on Saturday. On London’s AIM, Echo Energy jumped 30%. It said its wholly owned subsidiary, Echo Natural Resources, has entered into a shareholders joint venture agreement in Peru with the founding partners of Boku Resources. In Asia on Monday, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo was up 0.1%. In China, the Shanghai Composite was up 0.9%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was up marginally. The S&P/ASX 200 in Sydney closed down 0.2%. In the US on Friday, Wall Street ended lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.1%, the S&P 500 down 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.7%. Brent oil was quoted at $85.60 a barrel early in London on Monday, up from $84.84 late Friday. Gold was quoted at $2,324.50 an ounce, lower against $2,326.14.

The FTSE 100 index traded 51.69 points lower, 0.6%, at 8,115.07. The FTSE 250 fell 75.96 points, 0.4%, at 20,146.12, and the AIM All-Share was down 1.67 points, 0.2%, at 763.51. The Cboe UK 100 was down 0.8% at 807.43, the Cboe UK 250 fell 0.7% at 17,531.52, and the Cboe Small Companies was down 0.2% at 16,893.92. In European equities on Monday, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 0.9%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was 0.5% lower. Eurozone inflation data for June is released at 1000 BST, putting the spotlight on the European Central Bank. Analysts at ING commented: ‘Consensus for today’s eurozone-wide prints are 2.5% for headline and 2.8% for core. That is probably not enough to trigger a major repricing in rate expectations, but could soften the hawkish pushback by European Central Bank officials in Sintra. [ECB President Christine] Lagarde will deliver remarks today in the panel with [Federal Reserve Chair Jerome] Powell after she said the ECB needs more to assess inflation uncertainty in her opening remarks yesterday.’ ING sees some risk of a ‘dovish tilt’ from Powell, who also speaks in Portugal on Tuesday. ‘There has been a tendency from Powell to be a bit more optimistic than the FOMC consensus on disinflation, and we think there are some downside risks for the dollar ahead of today’s speech,’ ING analysts added. Elsewhere, the Dutch bank said the US job openings and labour turnover survey at 1500 BST has ‘decent market-moving potential’. The data comes ahead of Friday’s nonfarm payrolls, and Wednesday’s pre-cursor ADP jobs report. In China on Tuesday, the Shanghai Composite closed 0.1% higher, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was up 0.2%. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 ended 1.1% higher, though Sydney’s S&P/ASX 200 ended down 0.4%. The pound was quoted at $1.2620 early Tuesday, down from $1.2639 at the time of the London equities close on Monday. The euro faded to $1.0717 from $1.0723. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥161.66, up from JP¥161.58. In New York overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1%, the S&P 500 added 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite shot up 0.8%. Brent oil was quoted at $86.63 a barrel early Tuesday, rising from $86.18 at the time of the London equities close on Monday. ‘In energy, crude oil started the week strong ahead of the July 4th holiday in the US, which [the American Automobile Association] predicts will see a record number of drivers, and Hurricane Beryl, which is not expected to impact operations in the Gulf of Mexico immediately but could cause disruptions later in the week,’ Swissquote analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya commented. Hurricane Beryl has strengthened into a top-level category 5 storm after it swept across several islands in the southeastern Caribbean, dumping heavy rain and unleashing devastating winds. Beryl is now the earliest category 5 storm in the Atlantic on record and has developed into a ‘potentially catastrophic’ hurricane, the US National Hurricane Center said. Tracking oil prices higher, BP and Shell rose 1.0% and 0.3%, among the best FTSE 100-listed performers. On the decline, Sainsbury’s fell 2.5% as it reported a growth slowdown. However, it noted it made the biggest market share strides in the grocery industry in recent weeks. The supermarket chain said total sales in the 16 weeks to June 22, its first quarter, rose 4.2% on-year. Grocery sales alone rose 4.8%. Sainsbury’s said total retail sales, excluding fuel, rose 2.6%, while like-for-like sales climbed 3.0%. Like-for-like sales growth eased from 4.8% in the fourth-quarter. Away from grocery, the picture was less bullish for the firm. General Merchandise & Clothing sales were down 4.3%. Argos sales fell 6.2%. Edison analyst Russell Pointon commented: ‘Sainsbury’s Q1 trading update reveals a 2.6% rise in total retail sales, demonstrating its strong market presence, against a very tough comparative. The effects of reducing inflation are apparent in slowing like-for-like growth in every quarter since Q124. The quarter’s success is highlighted by Sainsbury’s achieving the largest market share among grocers, driven by a 4.8% increase in grocery sales. Notably, their summer innovation in food has spurred a 10% growth, with the introduction of over 400 new products.’ Wizz Air fell 3.0%, as it reported a decline in passenger numbers in June, with the budget carrier noted some aircraft were ‘grounded due to GTF engine inspections’. The GTF engine is made by manufacturer Pratt & Whitney, whose customers include plane maker Airbus. Wizz Air said June capacity rose 0.4% on-year to 5.8 million seats. Passenger numbers fell 0.2% to 5.3 million. Its load factor shrank to 91.7% from 92.2% a year earlier. On a rolling 12-month basis, however, capacity was 14% higher, passengers numbers up 15% and the load factor improved to 90.1% from 89.4%. For the whole of the first-quarter of its financial year, seat capacity rose 0.7% year-on-year, with passenger numbers up 0.5%, Wizz Air said. Wizz Air’s financial year runs to March. ‘Airbus updated the market on its revised manufacturing output on 25 June 2024. While the airline’s long-term growth plan remains unchanged, Wizz anticipates that this could impact the scheduled fleet program in the coming years, as previously indicated,’ Wizz Air added. Retailer Shoe Zone warned on profit, as it cautioned it is still grappling with ‘cost pressures associated with container prices’. The stock slumped 15%. Shoe Zone, which said the cost climb is due to a fall in the supply of shipping vessels and the continuation of a reroute away from the Suez Canal, now expects adjusted pretax profit for the year to October 2 of ‘not less than £10.0 million’. In May, it had lowered its profit forecast to £13.8 million from £15.2 million.

Having completed due diligence which revealed some short-term headwinds for the business, EQT revised down its possible cash offer from £25.50 to £24.30 on 27 June, upping it slightly to £24.50 today (28 June), the final day of the PUSU (put up or shut up) period. The revised   represents a 4% reduction on the 23 May offer of £25.50 per share. Keywords has requested a short extension to the PUSU deadline to the close of play on 3 July 2024. The shares gained 6% to £23.06 reflecting greater certainty a concrete offer will be made. SOFTER TRADING Keywords said it remains confident in delivering strong overall revenue and profit growth in 2024 with a second half weighting as the gaming industry recover from slower content creation trends. In addition, the company has seen a small number of larger game projects being delayed or cancelled creating capacity gaps, together with a slow ramp-up of content production in Hollywood following last year’s strikes. Consequently, first half organic revenue growth is expected to be slightly negative followed by a second half recovery back to 10% organic growth, in line with medium term guidance. THE EXPERT’S TAKE Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, commented: ‘It was clear from prolonged negotiations that EQT’s £25.50 per share proposal in May to buy gaming services group Keywords Studios had subsequently hit a stumbling block behind closed doors. ‘The deadline to make a formal offer had to be extended, and now it’s been revealed that EQT has been talking down the price seemingly because Keywords has suffered a few negative trading issues. ‘The market appears to have been worried about the takeover’s chances from the get-go because the share price continuously traded well below the initial £25.50 proposal. We still don’t have a firm offer, but the fact the board is minded to recommend the new lower price sends a signal to shareholders that this might be the best offer they get.’ Disclaimer: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in the article owns Shares magazine.

The FTSE 100 index traded 46.01 points higher, 0.6%, at 8,225.69. The FTSE 250 rose 50.55 points, 0.3%, at 20,382.352, while the AIM All-Share climbed 1.52 points, 0.2%, at 765.99. The Cboe UK 100 rose 0.5% to 818.58, the Cboe UK 250 firmed 0.2% at 17,748.24, but the Cboe Small Companies was down 0.1% at 16,907.31. A bright start is seen in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to open 0.1% higher, the S&P 500 is seen 0.3% firmer while the Nasdaq Composite is called to open 0.4% to the good. Much will depend on US data which is expected to show the core personal consumption expenditures inflation gauge faded to 2.6% in May, from 2.8% in April, according to FXStreet cited consensus. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell explained: ‘US core PCE price index is the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge to measure inflation and this new round of data will play a crucial role in the central bank‘s decision-making as it looks at when to ease monetary policy.’ ‘The market is likely to react positively if inflation comes in as expected as it would boost confidence that we’re only a stone’s throw away from the Fed cutting rates.’ In European equities on Friday, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 0.3%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt jumped 0.7%. The first round of the French legislative election takes place on Sunday. The latest Ifop poll on Thursday showed Marine Le Pen’s National Rally on 36%, ahead of the left-wing alliance on 29%, and President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist group on 21%. Citi thinks markets might be overly optimistic about the French election, pricing in a fairly benign election outcome, where fiscal policy does not become a major flashpoint. ‘This all means the election poses continued and meaningful risks to French and European equities,’ Citi said. An ‘extreme’ outcome, where the left, or right-wing secure a majority could lead to a 10% to 20% de-rating in equities, Citi warned. Election fever is also gripping the UK with the national vote next Thursday. On Friday, the ruling Conservative Party, reeling from opinion polls suggesting an electoral mauling, received some brighter economic news. The UK economy grew at a slightly sharper pace than expected at the start of the year, according to a revision from the Office for National Statistics. UK gross domestic product grew by 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in the three months to March, recovering after falls of 0.3% and 0.1% in the previous two quarters, and topping the prior estimate of a 0.6% increase. Year-on-year, growth was upwardly revised to 0.3% from 0.2%. The UK economy had declined 0.2% on-year in the final quarter of 2023. ‘In output terms, services grew by 0.8% on the quarter with widespread growth across the sector; elsewhere the production sector grew by 0.6% while the construction sector fell by 0.6%,’ the ONS said. An estimate earlier this month showed the UK economy registered no growth at the start of the second-quarter. GDP was unchanged on-month in April, following a rise of 0.4% in March, the ONS said earlier this month. Neil Shah at Edison said the figures show that the UK economy ‘is slowly starting to turn corner’. ‘Albeit slow, the economy has increased in the latest quarter following two consecutive quarters of negative growth and is slowly showing signs of a bounce back despite significant headwinds,’ Shah added. The pound was quoted at $1.2646 at midday Friday, down from $1.2650 at the time of the London equities close Thursday. The euro stood at $1.0705, ebbing from $1.0710. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥160.55, down from JP¥160.67. In London’s FTSE 100, Intertek rose 2.4% as Goldman Sachs upgraded to ’buy’ from ’neutral’. But JD Sports Fashion slid 4.4% in a negative read-across after disappointing results and guidance from Nike. Shares in Nike were down 15% in pre-market trading in New York after fourth quarter sales missed forecasts and the sportswear retailer cut guidance for financial 2025 once more. Analysts at Citi think Nike’s more ‘limited lifestyle product success will continue to present a headwind for JD Sports, but could create near-term opportunity for Adidas and Puma.’ In Frankfurt, shares in Adidas held firm, up 1.0%, but Puma sank 4.7%. In London, Tyman shares rose 2.6%. The window and door components supplier said shareholders will receive a special dividend, in addition to a takeover consideration from Quanex, following investor engagement. In a bid to soothe investor concern over the Quanex stock price since the cash and shares deal was announced, as well as adverse currency movements, Tyman shareholders also stand to receive a special interim dividend of 15 pence per share. That will be in addition to the agreed consideration of 240p cash plus 0.05715 of a Quanex share, for each Tyman share owned. ‘The Tyman directors believe that the transaction, as amended by this announcement, is in the best interests of Tyman shareholders as a whole and continue to recommend unanimously that Tyman shareholders vote or procure votes in favour of the scheme at the court meeting and to vote or procure votes in favour of the special resolution,’ Tyman added. Also the object of M&A interest, Keywords Studios rose 5.8%. It said it would be ‘minded to accept’ a takeover proposal from private equity firm EQT Group, which values the provider of technical and creative services for video game production at 2,450 pence per share, or £2.1 billion on a fully-diluted basis. It followed a revised cash offer of 2,430p made on Wednesday. On the wane, Gulf Marine Services fell 13% after Seafox International sold a 4.8% stake in the company, for £8.7 million. The stake was sold in a placing. Following the disposal, it owns just under a 24% stake in GMS. On firmer ground, shares in Tavistock Investments rose 8.8% after it said it was considering a number of potential transactions, including a possible disposal of part of the group’s business to Saltus. But the Ascot, Berkshire-based financial advice and investment management firm, which was responding to press reports, cautioned there was no guarantee that the deal with Saltus, a financial planning and investment management services group, would go ahead.

For the whole of the second quarter, the FTSE 100 climbed 2.7%, the FTSE 250 2.0% and the AIM All-Share 2.8%. All three indices fell over the month of June, however, with the FTSE 100 giving back 1.3%, the FTSE 250 2.1% and the AIM All-Share 5.1%. The Cboe UK 100 fell 0.1% to 813.63 on Friday, the Cboe UK 250 fell 0.5% to 17,625.17, but the Cboe Small Companies closed down 0.4% at 16,855.19. In European equities on Friday, the CAC 40 in Paris ended down 0.7%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt added 0.1%. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%, the S&P 500 was up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.2% higher. US inflationary pressures cooled in line with expectations, according to the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure. The Bureau of Economic Analysis said the core personal consumption index gauge grew 2.6% on-year in May, easing from 2.8% in April, which was also the pace of growth in March. The figure was in line with FXStreet-cited consensus. The core PCE index does not include food or energy. The headline index, which does, rose 2.6% on-year in May, easing from 2.7% growth in April. ‘Today’s data will likely help to provide additional confidence to the FOMC that the US economy is continuing along what remains a bumpy disinflationary path. Nevertheless, it remains the case that ’one swallow doesn’t make a summer’, hence the May PCE figures are unlikely to open the door to a cut on their own, though do push said door ajar a little more,’ Pepperstone analyst Michael Brown commented. The UK economy grew at a slightly sharper pace than expected at the start of the year, according to a revision from the Office for National Statistics. UK gross domestic product grew by 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in the three months to March, recovering after falls of 0.3% and 0.1% in the previous two quarters, and topping the prior estimate of a 0.6% increase. Year-on-year, growth was upwardly revised to 0.3% from 0.2%. The UK economy had declined 0.2% on-year in the final quarter of 2023. ‘In output terms, services grew by 0.8% on the quarter with widespread growth across the sector; elsewhere the production sector grew by 0.6% while the construction sector fell by 0.6%,’ the ONS said. An estimate earlier this month showed the UK economy registered no growth at the start of the second-quarter. GDP was unchanged on-month in April, following a rise of 0.4% in March, the ONS said earlier this month. The pound was quoted at $1.2639 late Friday afternoon, down from $1.2650 at the time of the London equities close Thursday. The euro stood at $1.0713, up slightly from $1.0710. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥160.88, up from JP¥160.67. Investors also have political developments to consider, with voters going to the polls in France this Sunday and a week later, and polling day in the UK coming on Thursday. In the US, election day is months away, but a debate overnight between President Joe Biden and his predecessor Donald Trump grabbed headlines. ‘Financial markets and traders are focused on the economic data and when the Fed will cut interest rates. In contrast, the media is focused on last night’s debate between Biden and Trump. Whether or not the Democrats can force President Biden to step down and replace him with a new candidate seems unlikely right now,’ XTB analyst Kathleen Brooks commented. ‘It is worth noting that stock markets tend to do slightly better in the long term under Democratic Presidents, however, we don’t think Biden’s disastrous performance at last night’s debate will have a material impact on markets in the short term. The election is still many months away and a lot could change. Added to this, under Biden the economic performance has been spectacular, but the deficit has surged, so the market may struggle to price in the impact of a reduced chance of a win for the Democrats on the back of last night’s debate performance.’ While the US presidential election later this year threatens to be nip and tuck, the UK general election result is likely to be a lot more emphatic, with Keir Starmer’s Labour Party the frontrunner. In France, political forces were on Friday making final bids for votes in crunch legislative elections that could see the far right take control of the government in a historic first. Official campaigning will end at midnight followed by a day off on Saturday, during which time political activity is forbidden ahead of voting on Sunday. Another week of campaigning will then lead up to the decisive second round on July 7. Opinion polls suggest the centrist alliance will come only third behind the National Rally and a broad but fragile left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front. In London, JD Sports lost 5.4%, the worst FTSE 100 listed performer. The athleisure firm followed Nike lower. Nike plunged 19% in New York on poorly received earnings and guidance. Elsewhere, musicMagpie slumped 12%. The seller of refurbished consumer technology, books, and disc media said that in the six months that ended May 31, its pretax loss narrowed to £3.0 million from £3.2 million a year prior. However, revenue declined 13% to £53.8 million from £61.9 million. Chief Executive Officer Steve Oliver said: ‘Amidst an increasingly competitive environment for second-use technology, and with consumers continuing to feel the squeeze on their wallets, the market has undoubtedly been challenging.’ Looking ahead, management expects the macroeconomic challenges to continue into the second half. Nightcap slumped 46%. The bar operator proposed an AIM exit, believing its ‘current public market valuation does not reflect the underlying potential of our business’. Nightcap had listed in January 2021, one of the first initial public offerings in a busy year for floats on London’s junior market. The stock has slumped some 80% since listing, however. Brent oil was quoted at $84.84 a barrel late Friday afternoon, down from $85.13 late Thursday. Gold was quoted at $2,326.14 an ounce, down slightly from $2,327.60. Monday’s economic calendar has a slew of manufacturing purchasing managers’ index readings, include China overnight, the eurozone at 0900 BST, the UK at 0930 and the US at 1445. In the UK corporate calendar, the start of July has half-year earnings from filtration technology company Porvair. Copyright 2024 Alliance News Ltd. All Rights Reserved.

The FTSE 100 index traded 23.26 points lower, 0.3%, at 8,202.07. The FTSE 250 fell just 7.08 points at 20,291.02, while the AIM All-Share fell 3.08 points, 0.4%, at 762.84. The Cboe UK 100 fell 0.3% to 815.91, the Cboe UK 250 lost 0.1% at 17,654.85, and the Cboe Small Companies was down 0.2% at 16,961.79. ‘Investors might be tinkering at the edges with portfolios but taking a cautious approach ahead of Friday’s US inflation data which could play a crucial role in deciding the next steps for the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy,’ AJ Bell analyst Russ Mould commented. Friday’s US data is expected to show the core personal consumption expenditures inflation gauge faded to 2.6% in May, from 2.8% in April, according to FXStreet cited consensus. Ahead of that reading, there is US gross domestic product data at 1330 BST on Thursday. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are all called to open 0.1% lower. In European equities on Thursday, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 0.5% and the DAX 40 in Frankfurt edged up 0.1%. Scope Markets analyst Joshua Mahony commented: ‘While we saw early gains for French stocks, the fact that we are seeing them fade once again comes as no surprise as we approach the weekend election. Yesterday saw yet another poll that pointed towards further gains for the Far-Right National Rally party, with a Macron loss becoming increasingly likely. Nonetheless, while the Bloomberg poll of polls has NR and its allies at 36% of the vote, the fact that this remains well below the 50% marker highlights the fact that we will likely have to wait until next Sunday to find out the result. With that in mind, traders should expect a jittery period ahead, with the fears of a fresh surge in borrowing costs and financial instability driving potential CAC and euro weakness.’ The pound was quoted at $1.2653 early Thursday afternoon, up from $1.2624 at the time of the London equities close Wednesday. The euro stood at $1.0702, rising from $1.0678. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥160.44, down from JP¥160.66. In London, DS Smith rose 6.1%. Brazil’s Suzano ended the pursuit of International Paper, which is on the verge of sealing a deal to acquire DS Smith. Suzano last month confirmed its interest in acquiring International Paper. Such a deal would have thrown into doubt International Paper’s acquisition of DS Smith. However, Suzano said Wednesday: ‘It is important to emphasize that it has always been a condition of Suzano for the completion of this transaction that the engagement between the parties be based on private, confidential, and amicable terms. As it was not possible to proceed in this manner, Suzano has decided to terminate the negotiations.’ GSK lost 5.5% on an unfavourable development in the US. For the upcoming virus season, it has been recommended in the US that everyone aged 75 and older receive a jab. People aged between 60 and 74 are recommended to receive one if they have certain chronic medical conditions, such as lung or heart disease. There was no recommendation for adults aged under 60, however. ‘The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, who advises how the US CDC recommends vaccines in the US has updated its recommendation for RSV vaccines, including GSK’s recently launched Arexvy. We anticipate this update will broadly be perceived as a narrowing from its previous recommendation and reigns in the scope for some longer-term Arexvy upgrades potentially materialising in H2 2024,’ analysts at Shore Capital Markets commented. ‘The ACIP’s previous recommendation was for older adults [over 60 years] using shared clinical decision-making, but following feedback from the medical community, shared clinical decision-making has been removed.’ Greeting cards and gifting firm Moonpig surged 12%. In the year that ended April 30, pretax profit rose 33% to £46.4 million from £34.9 million the previous year. Revenue grew 6.6% to £341.1 million from £320.1 million, 89% of which came from existing customers. The company said the start of financial 2025 was in line with expectations, with growth reported from both new and existing customer orders. Edison analyst Neil Shah commented: ‘With a solid operational and strategic foundation, a strong cash flow position, and continued investment in innovation and technology, including AI, Moonpig is well-positioned for continued growth in 2025. The business anticipates mid to high single-digit percentage revenue growth for the coming year.’ Harworth Group jumped 10% as it struck a deal to sell land at its Skelton Grange site in Leeds to Microsoft. The £106.6 million sale comprises two adjacent land parcels, for which the disposals are due to complete in the first half of 2024 and 2026 respectively. The first plot, which comprises 27 acres, will be sold on an unserviced basis for gross consideration of £52.9 million. The second, which comprises 21 acres, will be sold on a serviced basis for gross consideration of £53.2 million. Next 15 tumbled 15% as it reported ‘resilient’ trade but continues to grapple with tough market conditions. The digital marketing firm reported it has endured a tough macro environment in the four months to May 31. ‘The group has continued to deliver organic growth in its Customer Delivery segment offset by small declines in our other segments, in part due to delays in some clients’ spending, notably relating to government contracts in a period of political uncertainty,’ it said. Next 15 added that spending across its technology customers has ‘remained soft.’ The company expects full-year profit to be in line with management expectations.

The drop eradicates most the year’s gains leaving the shares up 3% compared with a 6% gain in the blue-chip FTSE 100 index. CDC CAUTIOUS ON RSV VACCINE USE The CDC’s advisory committee on immunisation practices voted unanimously to restrict RSV vaccine recommendation to the at-risk 60 to 74 age group and expand use for the over 75s. Jefferies analyst Peter Welford believes the decision may cut GSK’s addressable market from around 80 million people aged over 60 and another 13 million aged 50 to 59 to circa 55 million. The CDC’s decision is disappointing given that GSK gained FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approval for  Arexvy  in the prevention of RSV in adults aged 50 to 59 who are at increased risk on 10 June, the first vaccine to be endorsed for that age group. Shore Capital analyst Sean Conroy pointed out the decision does not preclude recommendations being more permissive once further efficacy and safety data has been accumulated. GSK expects to announce results of trials in adults aged 18 to 49 at increased risk, and immunocompromised adults aged 18 and over, in the second half of 2024. GSK’s  Arexvy  and  Pfizer’s (PFE:NYSE)   Abrysvo  are the leading RSV vaccines with the former holding around two thirds of the new RSV vaccine market. It generated £1.2 billion of revenue for GSK in 2023. Biotechnology company  Moderna (MRNA:NASDAQ)  received US regulatory approval for its RSV vaccine on 31 May. Moderna shares fell 5% yesterday (26 June) after the company revealed its RSV shot only showed 50% efficacy after 18 months and 47.4% after 24 months, compared with 78% for both GSK’s and Pfizer’s shot.

Thursday also marks a week until the UK heads to the polls. Two opinion polls published in the past 24 hours see Labour taking the lead, with Conservatives taking second place and Reform coming in third. Amongst individual stocks, DS Smith shot up, but failed to take the FTSE 100 index with it. It rallied after news that Brazil’s Suzano ended the pursuit of International Paper. The FTSE 100 index closed down 45.65 points, 0.6%, at 8,179.68. The FTSE 250 ended up 33.70 points, 0.2%, at 20,331.80, and the AIM All-Share closed down 1.45 points, 0.2%, at 764.47. The Cboe UK 100 ended down 0.5% at 814.33, the Cboe UK 250 closed up 0.3% at 17,717.52, and the Cboe Small Companies ended down 0.5% at 16,916.42. In European equities on Thursday, the CAC 40 in Paris ended down 1.0%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt ended up 0.3%. Stocks in New York lacked direction at the London equities close, as investors digested a wave of US economic data and eyed Friday’s inflation print. The DJIA was up 0.1% and the S&P 500 index up 0.2%, whilst the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.2%. US first-quarter economic growth was upwardly revised slightly on Thursday, as expected. US gross domestic product increased 1.4% quarter-on-quarter on an annualised basis in the three months to March 31. Growth eased from a 3.4% rally in the final three months of 2023. The GDP rise was upwardly revised from the second estimate, which suggested it grew 1.3%. The first estimate had said GDP rose 1.6%. Year-on-year, the US economy advanced 2.9% in the first-quarter, slowing from a 3.1% rise in the fourth. ‘Growth during the first half of the year is a little disappointing but it does not signal a significant increase in the odds of a recession or that the expansion is increasingly vulnerable. GDP is volatile and subject to large revisions. Since the economy is inherently seasonal, GDP is seasonally adjusted, although it is not perfect. The revisions to the PCE deflator will not alter the Federal Reserve’s calculus,’ analysts at Oxford Economics commented. On Friday there is the latest monthly US PCE data. According to FXStreet, the PCE reading is expected to ebb slightly to 2.6% in May on-year from 2.7% a month earlier. AJ Bell’s Russ Mould said the data ‘could play a crucial role in deciding the next steps for the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy’. In the UK, politics continues to dominate headlines, with just one week until people take to the polls. Two opinion polls have been published in the past 24 hours, both of which show Labour continuing to hold a large lead over the Conservatives, while Reform are several points behind the Tories in third place. A poll by More In Common, carried out online from June 24-26 among 3,420 adults in Britain, gives Labour a 17-percentage point lead over the Tories. The figures are Labour 40%, Conservative 23%, Reform 14%, Liberal Democrats 11%, Green 5%, SNP 3% and other parties 3%. A poll by Norstat, carried out online from June 24-26 among 2,025 adults in Britain, puts Labour 16 points ahead. The figures are Labour 39%, Conservative 23%, Reform 15%, Lib Dems 12%, Green 6%, SNP 4%, Plaid Cymru 1% and other parties 1%. The pound was quoted at $1.2650 at the London equities close Thursday, higher compared to $1.2624 at the close on Wednesday. The euro stood at $1.0710 at the European equities close Thursday, up against $1.0678 at the same time on Wednesday. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥160.67, little changed compared to JP¥160.66 late Wednesday. In London, the FTSE 100’s DS Smith ended up 6.1%. Brazil’s Suzano ended the pursuit of International Paper, which is on the verge of sealing a deal to acquire DS Smith. Suzano last month confirmed its interest in acquiring International Paper. Such a deal would have thrown into doubt International Paper’s acquisition of DS Smith. However, Suzano said Wednesday: ‘It is important to emphasize that it has always been a condition of Suzano for the completion of this transaction that the engagement between the parties be based on private, confidential, and amicable terms. As it was not possible to proceed in this manner, Suzano has decided to terminate the negotiations.’ Shares in International Paper were down 7.8% in New York. In the FTSE 250, Moonpig closed up 12% at the top of the index. It reported strong financial results. The London-based online greeting cards and gift company said in the year that ended April 30, pretax profit rose 33% to £46.4 million from £34.9 million the previous year. Revenue grew 6.6% to £341.1 million from £320.1 million, 89% of which came from existing customers. On the other hand, Currys lost 5.8%. Its shares struggled following the release of its annual results, perhaps hurt by the absence of a guidance lift. Revenue in the year ended April 27 fell 4.5% to £8.48 billion from £8.87 billion. It swung to a pretax profit of £28 million, from a loss of £462 million. Amongst London’s small-caps, Regional REIT plummeted 26%, after the commercial property investor announced a £110.5 million fundraising plan. It will raise the funds through a placing, overseas placing and open offer of 1.11 billion shares at 10p each. Harworth Group edged up 7.5%. The regenerator of land and property for sustainable development and investment said it has exchanged contracts for the conditional sale of 48 acres of land at the Skelton Grange site in Leeds for £106.6 million. Brent oil was quoted at $85.13 a barrel at the London equities close Thursday, up from $84.21 late Wednesday. Gold was quoted at $2,327.60 an ounce at the London equities close Thursday, up against $2,297.70 at the close on Wednesday. In Friday’s UK corporate calendar, there are full year results from Record and Thruvision. Other than the PCE reading in the US, the economic calendar for Friday has a GDP reading paired with current account data for the UK out at 0700 BST.

The UK economy had declined 0.2% on-year in the final quarter of 2023. ‘In output terms, services grew by 0.8% on the quarter with widespread growth across the sector; elsewhere the production sector grew by 0.6% while the construction sector fell by 0.6%,’ the ONS said. An estimate earlier this month showed the UK economy registered no growth at the start of the second-quarter. GDP was unchanged on-month in April, following a rise of 0.4% in March, the ONS said earlier this month. The euro stood at $1.0697, falling from $1.0710. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥160.94, up from JP¥160.67. French consumer price inflation abated in June, according to a preliminary reading on Friday. Insee said the annual rate of consumer price inflation abated to 2.1% this month, from 2.3% in May. On a harmonised basis, allowing for EU-wide comparison, the annual rate of inflation eased to 2.5% this month from 2.6% in May. The reading was in line with FXStreet cited consensus. Spain’s inflation rate cooled in June, numbers on Friday showed, but consumer prices still rose at a faster pace than expected. According to INE, the rate of consumer price inflation abated to 3.4% in June, from 3.6% in May. It had been expected to cool to 3.3%, however, according to FXStreet cited consensus. By the harmonised measure, allowing for EU-wide comparison, consumer prices expanded 3.5% on-year in June, easing from 3.8% in May. ‘Ahead of the weekend election, today sees the European Central Bank release its consumer inflation expectations for May. Three-year expectations currently sit at 2.4% and a drop under there - marking the lowest levels since before Russia invaded Ukraine - would add to expectations that the ECB could cut again in September. Currently, the market attaches a 64% probability to such an outcome. Perhaps the ECB will take encouragement from the Riksbank which yesterday added the possibility of an extra cut in the second half,’ analysts at ING commented. Over in Japan, numbers showed consumer price inflation in the nation’s capital picked up, putting the focus on the Bank of Japan. Annual consumer price inflation in Tokyo picked up to 2.3% in June, from 2.0% in May. Excluding fresh food, the rate of inflation accelerated to 2.1% from 1.9%, topping the consensus of 2.0%. The data failed to spur on the yen, while the euro could also struggle, with political developments in France in focus. ‘For the euro, the upcoming French election this weekend is probably more important than the inflation figures as regardless of the data – unless we see something very much unexpected – many investors will probably chose to go into the French election weekend without a positive exposure to the euro given that Marine Le Pen’s National Rally is seen securing one vote out of three, and that’s not the outcome that the market is happy with,’ Swissquote analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya commented. ‘A last word for the yen: the USDJPY was trading past the 161 level this morning, with no news of intervention on the wire just yet. The yen bears are looking for the limit, while the risk of intervention grows with every pip higher.’ Over in the UK, campaigning continues. It is likely that a week from now, voters will know UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s fate. PA reported Sunak will Friday turn his attention to education on the Conservative Party campaign trail in the North East. The PM has launched an attack on Labour’s plan to expand VAT so it covers private school fees, warning teachers and pupils could ‘see class sizes soar’ under a Labour government. Homeowners are on Labour’s agenda on Friday, as Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves claims people remortgaging their homes face paying £4,800 more under the Conservative Party’s fiscal plans. Across the Atlantic, a halting Joe Biden struggled to allay concerns he is too old for a second term in the White House in a fiery debate with Donald Trump marked by personal insults. Deutsche Bank analysts commented: ‘The general consensus among pundits is that Trump had the better performance, and a CNN flash poll of registered voters watching the debate found viewers thought Trump won by a 67%-33% margin. There are just two debates scheduled in this campaign, with the second on September 10, ahead of the election on November 5. Going into the debate, the national polls were neck-and-neck.’ In London, Tyman shares rose 2.4%. Window and door components supplier said shareholders will receive a special dividend, in addition to a takeover consideration from Quanex, following investor engagement. In a bid to soothe investor concern over the Quanex stock price since the cash and shares deal was announced, as well as adverse currency movements, Tyman shareholders also stand to receive a special interim dividend of 15 pence per share. That will be in addition to the agreed consideration of 240p cash plus 0.05715 of a Quanex share, for each Tyman share owned. ‘The Tyman directors believe that the transaction, as amended by this announcement, is in the best interests of Tyman shareholders as a whole and continue to recommend unanimously that Tyman shareholders vote or procure votes in favour of the scheme at the court meeting and to vote or procure votes in favour of the special resolution,’ Tyman added. Also the object of M&A interest, Keywords Studios rose 5.7%. It said it would be ‘minded to accept’ a takeover proposal from private equity firm EQT Group, which values the provider of technical and creative services for video game production at £1.96 billion. The proposal prices each Keywords share at 2,450p. It followed a revised cash offer of 2,430p made on Wednesday. Keywords in May, however, had said it received a cash bid of 2,550p per share from EQT. On the decline, Nightcap slumped 53%. The bars operator proposed an AIM exit, believing its ‘current public market valuation does not reflect the underlying potential of our business’. Nightcap had listed in January 2021, one of the first initial public offerings in a busy year for floats on London’s junior market. The stock has slumped some 80% since listing, however. Brent oil was quoted at $85.84 a barrel early Friday, up from $85.13. Gold was quoted at $2,328.36 an ounce, rising slightly from $2,327.60. Copyright 2024 Alliance News Ltd. All Rights Reserved.

A May figure of 2.6% or lower, against April’s 2.8% print, and the market will be off to the races, although as Fed chair Jay Powell has said many times before we shouldn’t get carried away about one good data point. There have been highs this week –  Amazon.com (AMZN:NASDAQ)  hitting a $3 trillion valuation,  Rivian (RIVN:NASDAQ)  shares jumping 50% on investment from German carmaker  Volkswagen (VOW:ETR)  – but there have also been lows, in  Micron Technology (MU:NASDAQ)   and  Walgreens Boots (WBA:NASDAQ) , the past week's biggest loser after a 23% plunge. Aussie bonds were down on a worse-than-expected inflation report, and the Japanese yen, which reached its weakest level against the dollar since 1986. In an interesting twist, a survey from Goldman Sachs shows hedge funds have been ‘aggressively’ selling tech stocks this month, led by chip manufacturers and equipment makers, with June’s net sales the largest on record. The news follows a sharp downturn in  Nvidia (NVDA:NASDAQ)  shares earlier this month, shortly after it became the world’s most valuable company. MICRON TECHNOLOGY The Idaho-based firm’s computer memory and storage solutions put it smack bang at the centre of the AI boom, but while Micron’s most advanced memory is needed for graphics processing units like Nvidia’s, quarterly earnings and guidance was just not blow out enough. AI excitement is such that Micron investors have chased the shares 60% higher in 2024, and they’ve doubled in under a year, recording an all-time high of $153.45 (18 Jun), but inline guidance was not enough to convince the fast money that there’s more upside in the near-term. What it did say, and show, is that the long-run AI story remains intact, with guidance for 90% year-on-year revenue growth. The most important part of the update is Micron’s ramping HBM (high bandwidth memory) technology this year, a meaningful market share landgrab that could hit 20% in 2025, from zero at the start of this year. Demand is such that Micron has now fully sold out HBM capacity through the end of calendar 2025. ‘We believe that Micron will be one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry in the multiyear growth opportunity driven by AI’, said chief executive Sanjay Mehrotra said. NIKE Investors ‘just did it’ and sold shares in the trainers’ giant overnight, and who can blame them. They have started to get used to underperformance from a sportswear firm that used to tick all the right investment boxes. While  Nike’s (NKE:NYSE)  fourth quarter earnings beat Wall Street expectations, thanks to cost-cutting, revenue of $12.61 billion came in 2% light of consensus. But the real damage was done by cuts to 2025 guidance, partly because of weakness in China, but also on its home court. Revenues in North America, Nike’s largest market, came in below market expectations at $5.28 billion and the company now expects sales to fall 10% in the current quarter amid ‘uneven consumer trends’ across its markets, including a decline in online sales and a poor performance from its Converse brand. Savage competition in the athletic apparel market has sharp teeth so having previously guided towards full year 2025 sales growth, Beaverton-based Nike now forecasts sales to be down by mid-single digits. The stock plunged more than 14% in after-hours trading (27 Jun), a sure sign that investors refuse to back hope of form improving anytime soon. FEDEX Logistics firm  FedEx (FDX:NYSE)  jumped more than 16% to 12-month high territory over the past week after the delivery giant posted better than expected fourth quarter earnings and guided for more of the same in fiscal 2025 (26 Jun). Given its bellwether status, investors might have interpreted FedEx’s earnings surprise as a green tick for the global economy if it weren’t for the fact the company is undergoing a sweeping cost-cutting and restructuring programme. Chief executive Raj Subramaniam confirmed the company was on track to deliver $4 billion of cost savings by the end of fiscal 2025 after notching up $1.8 billion in 2024. Further cost savings of $2 billion are anticipated following the company’s DRIVE transformation programme, announced in April 2023, to consolidate air and ground services into a unified business amid activist pressure to improve performance. Chief financial officer John Dietrich said the newly consolidated business is expected to be a big driver of margin improvement in 2025. The company guided for mid-single digit revenue growth and EPS (earnings per share) in the range of $20 to $22 implying a slight upgrade against consensus estimates of $20.92.   You can opt out at any time."},

Out of hours trading data shows the stock plunging nearly 14% to around $80, not half 2021’s near-$180 dollar peaks.  It may be the world’s biggest sportswear company but Nike is feeling the pinch as competition bites and sales in China and its US backyard flag, forcing the firm to cut full year 2025 (to end May) guidance. Less swoosh, more damp squib, and AJ Bell’s investment director Russ Mould believes a reckoning is looming.  ‘A lot now rests on an investor day in November, with the company likely to face pressure to take radical action’, he says.  Shares in key UK retail partner  JD Sports Fashion  ( )  fell 4.4% to 120.8p on the negative read-across, while Mike Ashley’s  Frasers  ( )  pulled 0.4% lower to 878.5p. In contrast, Nike’s German arch-rival  Adidas (ADS:ETR)  edged 0.5% higher to €224 on hopes it can capitalise on the woes of its American competitor and win market share. LEADEN FOOTED PERFORMANCE Nike’s adjusted earnings per share of $1.01 for the fourth quarter to May 2024 beat the 83 cents expected by Wall Street thanks to the sneakers-to-basketball boot seller’s cost-cutting drive. However, revenue of $12.61 billion was down 2% year-on-year and shy of the $12.84 billion analysts were looking for amid broad-based underperformance from Nike, which is seeing rising athletic apparel market competition from the likes of On Running and Hoka. Nike reported a decline in online sales and a poor performance from its Converse brand. Revenues in North America, the Beaverton-based group’s biggest market, came in below market expectations at $5.28 billion, while NIKE Direct revenues were down 8% year-on-year at $5.1 billion. On the positive side of the ledger, gross margin improved by 110 basis points to 44.7% thanks to ‘strategic pricing actions’ from Nike and lower freight, logistics and warehousing costs, while closing inventory was 11% lower year-on-year at $7.5 billion. CHINA SOFTNESS PERSISTS Despite the anticipated boost a summer of sport, Nike now expects first quarter sales to fall by 10% amid ‘uneven consumer trends’ across its markets, with sales in China remaining soft. Having previously guided towards full year 2025 revenue growth, Nike now forecasts sales to be down by mid single digits and also lowered its first half guidance, with sales now seen down in the high single digits versus the previously forecast low single digit decline. ‘The China marketplace remains highly promotional, and we continue to manage both Nike and partners’ inventory carefully,’ said chief financial officer Matthew Friend. ‘While our outlook for the near term has softened, we remain confident in Nike’s competitive position in China in the long term.’ CEO John Donahoe commented: ‘We are taking our near-term challenges head-on, while making continued progress in the areas that matter most to Nike’s future - serving the athlete through performance innovation, moving at the pace of the consumer and growing the complete marketplace.’ THE EXPERT’S VIEW Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: ‘The company’s digital-led, direct-to-consumer strategy is faltering, its problems in China aren’t going away and it is losing market share to specialist rivals in areas like running. ‘China had been an area of real growth for Nike but it has not been helped by the growing tensions between the world’s second largest economy and the West, with some Chinese shoppers boycotting brands from the US and Europe, nor by the Asian country’s uneven Covid recovery.’ Mould added: ‘But Nike faces problems closer to home, too. Its clothing and footwear is not cheap and to get consumers to part with their hard-earned cash, the company needs to deliver products which really resonate. Recent trends suggest it is struggling to do so, with the successful Jordan brand not enough to sustain things on its own. This could see calls for change when investors gather later in the year, which ‘might include offloading the recently underperforming Converse brand, for example.’ DISCLAIMER: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in this article owns Shares magazine.

Small-caps’ ProCook surged, after it said it has swung to a profit. The FTSE 100 index was up 6.74 points, 0.1%, at 8,254.53.

On Friday there is the latest US personal consumption expenditures data. Before then, on Thursday, investors will be digesting a US gross domestic product reading. Ricardo Evangelista at ActivTrades said: ‘Personal core expenditure, considered the Fed’s favourite inflation gauge, is likely to impact the Federal Reserve’s stance on interest rate cuts, especially if the reading surprises.’ According to FXStreet, the PCE reading is expected to ebb slightly to 2.6% in May on-year from 2.7% a month earlier.

Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥160.02, higher compared to JP¥159.73. Back in Europe, upcoming elections in the UK and France have gripped the news. The Westminster gambling row has rolled on, after a Cabinet minister revealed he had placed bets on the date of the UK general election. It is little over a week until polling day. Scotland Secretary Alister Jack denied having broken any rules but said he put three wagers on the timing of the July 4 poll, becoming the latest of seven politicians and officials to get drawn in to the controversy. Labour was also dragged into the row on Tuesday, with the party suspending its candidate Kevin Craig after it emerged he had bet that he would lose to the Tories in the contest for Central Suffolk & North Ipswich. The French election is also creeping closer, with votes being cast on Sunday. French President Emmanuel Macron is warning voters against choosing the far right or the hard left, asserting that their divisive policies increase the risk of political ‘conflict and civil war.’ His comments have sparked controversy. In the FTSE 100, Phoenix Group lost 1.5%, after it said it is exploring a potential disposal of SunLife. Phoenix, the London-based insurer and pensions provider, said it had made the decision following a strategic review. ‘The group has concluded that this business is no longer core to the delivery of its vision of becoming the UK’s leading retirement savings and income business,’ the company said. In the FTSE 250, Future shares jumped 9.9% after Jefferies upgraded the magazine publisher to ’buy’ from ’underperform’. Amongst London’s small-caps, ProCook shot up 21%. The pots and pans seller reported that revenue in the year to March 31 rises 0.4% to £62.6 million from £62.3 million. It swung to a pretax profit of £700,000 from a loss of £6.5 million. ‘The group has had a strong start to the new financial year with trading momentum continuing to build on the trend established during the last financial year,’ ProCook added. On AIM, Gelion surged 60%, after it scored a deal with FTSE 100 Glencore. The battery technology firm penned a joint development agreement with Glencore, aiming to ‘accelerate the commercialisation of Gelion’s next generation battery technologies’.

Already on Wednesday, investors have been investing some weak US housing data. The US Census Bureau reported that new home sales fell by 11% in May on-month to 619,000 from 698,000 a month earlier. ‘New home sales may continue to be subdued until we see a more substantial decline in mortgage rates. We do expect a modest rebound in sales later in H2 of this year when we look for mortgage rates to decline more decisively below 7% once Fed rate cuts get underway,’ said analysts at Oxford Economics. ‘Our forecast continues to be for the first rate cut to come in September, with cuts to continue at every other meeting after that.’ The pound was quoted at $1.2624 at the London equities close Wednesday, lower compared to $1.2676 at the close on Tuesday.

Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥160.66, higher compared to JP¥159.73 late Tuesday. In Europe, markets are facing political instability in the run up to the French and the UK elections. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and the chief of the main far-right party Jordan Bardella clashed in an ill-tempered debate Tuesday that exposed fierce tensions less than a week ahead of the most polarising election in decades. Attal, Bardella and hard-left MP Manuel Bompard, representing the left-wing coalition, exchanged accusations in a sometimes bruising live TV encounter where discussion of issues was often drowned by a cacophony of voices. Bardella’s National Rally still has a clear lead in opinion polls ahead of Sunday’s first round of voting in the parliamentary elections, followed by the left-wing New Popular Front coalition with President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist alliance lagging in third. Uncertainty in the political sphere was not limited to France, with so-called ‘gamblegate’ dominating the UK election. This comes little over a week until polling day. In the FTSE 100, Phoenix Group closed down 1.5%, after it said it is exploring a potential disposal of its SunLife business. The London-based insurer and pensions provider said it had made the decision following a strategic review. Haleon lost 0.3%. The Surrey, England-based consumer healthcare arm said it has agreed to sell its nicotine replacement therapy business outside of the US to Dr Reddy’s Laboratories SA. The deal is worth up to £500 million in total. ‘This divestment will allow Haleon to exit the NRT category outside of the US and will reduce complexity across the business allowing increased focus on strategic growth areas,’ Haleon said. In the FTSE 250, shares in Future leapt 8.3%, boosted by a double-upgrade from Jefferies sparked by its confidence in a strong return to revenue growth at the company. ‘Signs of inflection and Growth Acceleration Strategy progress provide us with confidence to double upgrade Future,’ the broker stated in a note to clients. Jefferies moved Future, the Bath, England-based online magazine publisher and owner of price comparison website Go Compare, to ’buy’ from ’underperform’. Apax Global Alpha edged up 3.0%. The London-based investment trust announced a €30 million share buyback, as it concludes the review of its capital allocation policy. ‘The new capital allocation framework constructed in line with AGA’s investment objectives to maximise returns for shareholders across economic cycles, and taking into account AGA’s overall financial position which continues to be prudently managed,’ Apax explained. Amongst London’s small-caps, ProCook rose 12%. The pots and pans seller said revenue in the year to March 31 rises 0.4% to £62.6 million from £62.3 million. It swung to a pretax profit of £700,000 from a loss of £6.5 million. Brent oil was quoted at $84.21 a barrel at the London equities close Wednesday, down from $85.05 late Tuesday.

In European equities on Tuesday, the CAC 40 in Paris ended down 0.6%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt ended down 0.9%. French politics remained in focus. President Emmanuel Macron came under strong criticism on Tuesday for warning a far-right or hard-left win in snap polls could spark a ‘civil war’, with his opponents urging him not to scare the public. France is preparing to vote on Sunday in the country’s most polarising ballot in decades. Macron called the parliamentary polls after the far-right National Rally scored a runaway victory in European Parliament elections earlier this month. Ahead of the election, on Wednesday, there is unemployment and consumer confidence data for France. In the UK, it is the final full week of campaigning before the July 4 general election. Amid campaigning, the Conservative party has withdrawn support from candidates Craig Williams and Laura Saunders after they were implicated in the General Election betting row. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak acted after coming under mounting pressure within the party to take a tougher stance on the alleged use of inside information to bet on the timing of the July 4 poll. Stocks in New York were mixed at the London equities close, with the DJIA down 0.7%, the S&P 500 index up 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite up 1.1%. Away from politics, US data will be in focus this week, with a gross domestic product reading on Thursday and the latest personal consumption expenditures data on Friday. The pound was quoted at $1.2676 at the London equities close Tuesday, lower compared to $1.2691 at the close on Monday. The euro stood at $1.0705 at the European equities close Tuesday, down against $1.0728 at the same time on Monday. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥159.73, slightly higher compared to JP¥159.69 late Monday. In the FTSE 100, Admiral rose 2.2% to the top of the index. Direct Line lost 0.4%. Berenberg raised Admiral to ’buy’ on Tuesday, believing the insurer to be a ‘wonderful company at a fair price’, though it cut Direct Line, seeing few positive catalysts ahead. In other news, DS Smith and International Paper have cleared a regulatory hurdle on the way to their proposed combination. London-based packing company DS Smith agreed an all-share takeover by its Memphis, Tennessee-based rival in April, which would leave its shareholders with 33.7% of the combined group and values each DS Smith share at 415 pence. On Tuesday, DS Smith and International Paper announced that the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act has expired. ‘This is an important step in the consummation of the proposed combination as the expiration removes the HSR Act’s bar to closing,’ the companies explained. DS Smith closed up 1.4%. International Paper was down 1.0% in New York. On the other hand, London-listed jet engine maker Rolls-Royce and aerospace firm Melrose traded lower. The duo were down 1.1% and 2.4%, respectively. The shares took a hit, after Airbus lowered its outlook. Tumbling in Paris, Airbus closed down 9.4%. In the FTSE 250, Carnival rose 9.4%, after second quarter results beat guidance on ‘every measure’. In the three months to May 31, Carnival reported net income of $92 million, swinging from a $407 million loss a year prior. Revenue rose 18% to $5.78 billion from $4.91 billion. Adjusted net income of $134 million, or $0.11 per share, outperformed March guidance by nearly $170 million, driven by higher ticket prices, higher onboard spending and the timing of expenses between quarters, Carnival said. ‘Off the back of that effort, we closed yet another quarter delivering records, this time across revenues, operating income, customer deposits and booking levels, exceeding our guidance on every measure,’ commented Chief Executive Officer Josh Weinstein. On London’s AIM, SIMEC Atlantis Energy shares more than doubled. In 2023, SIMEC Atlantis swung to a £22.8 million pretax profit from a £11.1 million pretax loss the previous year. Revenue multiplied to £15.3 million from £3.9 million. Chair Duncan Black commented: ‘We have the funding and visibility on future revenues we need to be able to deliver our development projects and service our debt. We have a pipeline of projects that would be the envy of many much larger companies.’ Brent oil was quoted at $85.05 a barrel at the London equities close Tuesday, virtually unchanged compared to $85.07 late Monday. Gold was quoted at $2,324.50 an ounce at the London equities close Tuesday, lower against $2,331.10 at the close on Monday.

The shares added 5p or 4.5% to 118p, taking them to a new 12-month high and bringing gains to 37% since June last year. NEW STRATEGY A SUCCESS After removing non-core channels and loss-making sales, revenue for the year to March declined 9% to £1.04 billion, but the firm noted it returned to growth in the final quarter and said it expected to move back to double-digit growth in the current financial year. Operating profit soared 192% from £12.5 million to £36.2 million, above the top end of forecasts, thanks to the ‘strategic pivot’ towards profit and cash generation as well as tight cost control. With a 15% market share in major domestic appliances, the firm counted more than 600,000 customers last year of whom more than half were repeat buyers. The company also continues to burnish its ‘green’ credentials, having recycled or refurbished more than seven million appliances at its in-house facility, and is working with other firms to use its recycled plastic in new products. RETURN TO TOP-LINE GROWTH ‘We have made good progress on our profit performance in FY24, which is a testament to the success of our strategic pivot to focusing on profit and cash generation’,   founder and chief executive John Roberts. ‘We are now a much simpler, more efficient business and are performing better than ever for customers, with excellent and sustainable unit economics. ‘Our focus now is on delivering profitable top line growth with an ambition for double digit revenue growth in FY25’, concluded Roberts. Jefferies analyst Andrew Wade took a positive view of the results and the outlook: ‘After an exceptional FY24 for AO, we are encouraged that, now a quarter into the new year, management has reiterated its double-digit FY25 growth aspiration. We raise our revenue forecast to reflect this, see scope for upgrades to continue, and retain our positive stance.’ You can opt out at any time."},

Investors welcomed the   for the four months to 24 June ahead of the firm’s annual general meeting, with the shares gaining 1.3% to 114.3p, although they remain 22p or 16% below where they started the year. The company said the ocean and river cruise businesses had enjoyed an ‘exceptional’ start to the year with booked load factors (percentage of available cargo space being utilised) at 83% and 78% respectively, both ahead of the prior year. Travel bookings were also ahead of the prior year driven by a higher number of passengers with booked revenue up 14% year on year. As expected, market conditions remained challenging for the insurance business, although the company pointed to the benefits of pricing actions which it said were earning through to an improving combined operating ratio.   The combined operating ratio is a measure of insurance profitability. A ratio above 100% signifies costs are higher than premiums. In the year to 31 January Saga insurance reported an improved combined operating ratio of 117% from 120.5% in the prior year. WHAT DID THE COMPANY SAY? Group chief executive Mike Hazel commented: ‘Looking ahead, we are focused on driving sustainable business growth in a capital-light way, while growing our customer base and deepening our connections with those customers.’ The company said it continued to explore partnership opportunities in ocean cruise and insurance to support growth and ‘enhance long term returns for shareholders.’ AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said partnerships were a key part of Saga’s strategy, allowing it to grow without having to employ lots of capital and helping it address a stretched balance sheet. Mould commented: ‘The company walked back on an attempt to effectively outsource its underwriting operation last year.’ ‘However, there is clearly appetite among management to keep pursuing these sorts of deals, including for its cruise ships which are expensive to run, and the market is likely to judge the company on its ability to deliver. ‘There is plenty about the Saga proposition which makes sense – the demographic it serves is substantial and growing and typically has more disposable income than other parts of the population. It also remains a strong brand which seems to resonate with its target audience. ‘However, since listing a decade ago the company has, through a mix of poor execution and events like the pandemic, consistently failed to match up to expectations.’ Disclaimer: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in the article owns Shares magazine.

In London, investors had a host of corporate updates to sink into, including bullish earnings from pandemic winners AO World and ProCook. A merger agreement between Witan Investment Trust and Alliance Trust also grabbed some of the spotlight. The FTSE 100 index traded 28.42 points higher, 0.3%, at 8,276.21. The FTSE 250 was up 60.31 points, 0.3%, at 20,423.74, though the AIM All-Share fell 0.68 of a point, 0.1%, at 767.35. The Cboe UK 100 rose 0.3% to 823.17, the Cboe UK 250 added 0.1% at 17,769.98, and the Cboe Small Companies was flat at 16,863.70. In European equities on Wednesday, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.3% and the DAX 40 in Frankfurt shot up 0.8%. In China on Wednesday, the Shanghai Composite ended 0.8% higher. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong was 0.1% higher. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo closed up 1.3%, though the S&P/ASX 200 in Sydney fell 0.7%. In New York on Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.8% lower. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.3%. Among the tech shares recovering was chipmaker Nvidia, adding 6.8%. Elsewhere, a top Federal Reserve official has backed more interest rate rises if inflation sticks at its current level, saying immigration and aggressive fiscal stimulus are likely to keep US prices rising more quickly than in other rich economies. Michelle Bowman, one of the Fed’s governors and a voter on its rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, said she remained ‘willing to raise’ borrowing costs again ‘should progress on inflation stall or even reverse’. ING analysts commented: ‘Bowman’s call for no cuts in 2024 confirmed her position as the most hawkish member of the FOMC. Fed members are being generally cautious about jumping into disinflation optimism, and while we expect an encouraging 0.1% month-on-month core PCE on Friday, the narrative may not turn more dovish unless the June CPI (out 11 July) cools off too. Market pricing continues to hover around 45-50bp of easing by year-end, which sounds quite dovish compared to recent Fed communication but is not inconsistent with the latest data, in our view.’ The pound was quoted at $1.2669 early Wednesday, falling from $1.2676 at the time of the European equities close Tuesday. The euro stood at $1.0687, down from $1.0705. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥159.89, up from JP¥159.73. Focus remains on political developments in the UK and France, with elections looming. The Westminster gambling row has deepened after a Cabinet minister revealed he had placed bets on the date of the UK general election. Scotland Secretary Alister Jack denied having broken any rules but said he put three wagers on the timing of the July 4 poll, becoming the latest of seven politicians and officials to get drawn in to the controversy. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will face further pressure over the revelation, which comes after he caved to mounting calls from within the Tory Party to withdraw support for two parliamentary candidates facing a Gambling Commission investigation. Labour was also dragged into the row on Tuesday, with the party suspending its candidate Kevin Craig after it emerged he had bet that he would lose to the Tories in the contest for Central Suffolk & North Ipswich. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and the chief of the main far-right party Jordan Bardella clashed in an ill-tempered debate Tuesday that exposed fierce tensions less than a week ahead of the most polarising election in decades. Attal, Bardella and hard-left MP Manuel Bompard, representing the left-wing coalition, exchanged accusations in a sometimes bruising live TV encounter where discussion of issues was often drowned by a cacophony of voices. Bardella’s National Rally still has a clear lead in opinion polls ahead of Sunday’s first round of voting in the parliamentary elections, followed by the left-wing New Popular Front coalition with President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist alliance lagging in third. In London, Future shares jumped 9.9% after Jefferies upgraded the magazine publisher to ’buy’ from ’underperform’. Witan Investment Trust and Alliance Trust announced a merger to form Alliance Witan. The deal will see Witan’s assets rolled into Alliance Trust in exchange for shares in the enlarged company. The firm will have net assets of around £5 billion and it will be primed for FTSE 100 inclusion. The firms said Alliance Trust shareholders will not suffer any NAV dilution. Depending on how many take up a cash exit option, shareholders in Witan Investment Trust will not either. Witan investors will have the option for a cash exit for some or all of their shares at a price equal to just under 98% of Witan’s NAV. This option will be limited to just under 18% of Witan shares in issues. It will be the ‘largest ever investment trust’ combo, Witan Chair Andrew Ross said. ‘The deal will result in one of the leading investment companies listed in London and will stand our shareholders in good stead for many years to come,’ Ross added. Witan shares rose 4.4%, while Alliance Trust added 1.0%. AO World rose 3.6% after the electricals retailer posted a profit beat. Pretax profit in the year ended March 31 jumped to £34.3 million, from £7.6 million the year prior. Adjusted pretax profit also amounted to £34.3 million, surging from £12.0 million, and beating its guidance range of £28 million to £33 million. Revenue, meanwhile, fell 8.8% to £1.04 billion from £1.14 billion. It said the revenue outturn was expected, after it removed ‘non-core channels and loss-making sales’. AO World noted revenue returned to growth in the fourth-quarter, meanwhile. Looking ahead, it said: ‘Despite the ongoing macro-economic challenges our objectives remain unchanged and we are confident in our ability to deliver on our ambition for double digit revenue growth in FY25.’ It targets adjusted pretax profit of £36 million to £41 million, at best a 20% rise on-year. ProCook surged 9.6% on improved annual results and a confident outlook. The pots and pans seller said revenue in the year to March 31 rose 0.4% to £62.6 million from £62.3 million. It swung to a pretax profit of £700,000 from a loss of £6.5 million. ‘The group has had a strong start to the new financial year with trading momentum continuing to build on the trend established during the last financial year,’ it added. During the first-quarter of the new year, like-for-like sales rose 3.5%. ProCook said: ‘Whilst mindful of the uncertain macro backdrop, we are confident in our unique specialist proposition and encouraged by the improving momentum we have been delivering over the last year.’ Brent oil was quoted at $84.58 a barrel early Wednesday, down from $85.05 at the time of the London equities close Tuesday.

The combination of these FTSE 250 constituents will create ‘Alliance Witan’, an investment trust goliath with net assets north of £5 billion and big enough for FTSE 100 inclusion. Shares in Witan rose 4.5% to 272.5p on the news, while Alliance Trust’s shares ticked up 1% to £12.14. GLOBAL ONE-STOP SHOP Representing the largest ever conventional equity investment trust combination, the   follows a comprehensive strategic review of Witan’s management arrangements by the board after long-serving CEO Andrew Bell announced plans to retire. Both trusts pursue a multi-manager approach and their boards believe the combination will create an ‘even more liquid, high-profile and cost-efficient “one-stop shop” investment vehicle’ for global equities. WTW’S WINNING STRATEGY Current Alliance Trust manager, Willis Towers Watson, will have overall responsibility for managing the assets of the combined fund, employing the same multi-manager approach utilised by Alliance Trust since Willis Towers Watson’s 2017 appointment - selecting a diverse team of stock pickers, each of whom invests in a selection of 10 to 20 of their ‘best ideas’. Over the seven years since Willis Towers Watson’s appointment at the start of April 2017 to 31 March 2024, Alliance Trust’s NAV (net asset value) total return was 104.2% against 95.7% for the MSCI All Country World Index benchmark. Witan shareholders who roll over into Alliance Witan will benefit from an immediate uplift in the value of their shareholding, since Alliance Trust’s shares trade at a tighter discount to NAV than Witan’s; they’ll also be given the opportunity to elect for a cash exit at a price close to NAV. A new management fee structure and economies of scale resulting from the merger will allow Alliance Witan to target an ongoing charges basis points ratio in the high 50s in future financial years, below Witan’s and Alliance Trust’s current ongoing charge ratios of 76 and 62 basis points respectively. Witan chairman Andrew Ross said the board was ‘unanimous’ in recommending the combination, which ‘allows the continuation of our multi manager approach at lower fees and in a larger, more liquid vehicle. The companies share similar cultures and a mutual desire to provide a “one-stop shop” for retail investors in global equities. I am delighted to announce this transaction, the largest ever investment trust combination, in Witan’s 100th year as a quoted company on the London Stock Exchange.’ THE EXPERTS WEIGH IN Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, commented: ‘Investors who want to beat the market often turn to actively managed investment funds or trusts in the hope that they will outperform. Given these fund managers are collecting an annual fee for the work, one would hope they can do better than the market, but Witan has found it hard to achieve this goal on a sustainable basis.’ Mould continued: ‘Retirement   by Witan’s CEO Andrew Bell prompted a review of the trust and it was effectively plonked on the market with a “for sale” sign, in the hope that a rival would take it over. ‘Its closest competitor Alliance Trust has won the match and is set to create a £5 billion investment trust group that would put it on a par with  F&C Investment Trust  ( )  in terms of size.’ Winterflood Investment Trusts pointed out that against a backdrop of sustained wide discounts and increasing pressure on sub-scale funds due to wealth manager consolidation, the last two years has seen ‘a significantly elevated level of corporate activity in the investment trust sector, including numerous mergers. However, none so far have been of this scale, with two of the top 30 largest investment trusts proposing a merger to create a circa £5 billion fund eligible for FTSE 100 inclusion’. Winterflood added: ‘We think that the combination of Witan and Alliance Trust makes sense and is not a great surprise given the recent announcement by Witan that it was reviewing its management arrangements and the similarities between the two funds’ investment approaches, with both being multi-manager global equity funds.’ DISCLAIMER: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in this article owns Shares magazine.

The pound was quoted at $1.2638 early Thursday, up from $1.2624 at the time of the London equities close Wednesday. The euro stood at $1.0694, rising from $1.0678. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥160.53, down from JP¥160.66. The yen recovered slightly after hitting a 38-year low against the dollar, putting investors on alert for a possible intervention by Japanese authorities. The Japanese unit’s latest retreat came as uncertainty surrounded the Federal Reserve’s timetable for cutting interest rates, and the Bank of Japan’s caution in tightening monetary policy. Focus has turned to Tokyo, where Vice Finance Minister Masato Kanda said earlier in the week that authorities were keeping a close eye on movements in forex markets and were ready to step in with yen support 24 hours a day. Their determination was put to the test after the yen fell to 160.87 per dollar late Wednesday – its weakest since 1986 – as US Treasury yields spiked. The economic calendar on Thursday has a US gross domestic product reading at 1330 BST, after eurozone consumer confidence at 1000 BST. On Friday, all eyes will be on the latest core personal consumption expenditures inflation gauge, the Fed’s preferred measure. Focus will also be on political developments, as election campaigns in the UK and France near the finish line, and as US President Joe Biden prepares for a debate against his predecessor Donald Trump. Biden and Trump square off for a historic US presidential debate Thursday, with the stage set for what could be an inflection point in the 2024 race as millions of voters tune in to the clash of rivals. In London, DS Smith rose 6.7%. Brazil’s Suzano ended the pursuit of International Paper, which is on the verge of sealing a deal to acquire DS Smith. Suzano last month confirmed its interest in acquiring International Paper. Such a deal would have thrown into doubt International Paper’s acquisition of DS Smith. However, Suzano said Wednesday: ‘It is important to emphasize that it has always been a condition of Suzano for the completion of this transaction that the engagement between the parties be based on private, confidential, and amicable terms. As it was not possible to proceed in this manner, Suzano has decided to terminate the negotiations.’ GSK lost 5.5% on an unfavourable development in the US. The US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention updated its recommendation for the use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines. For the upcoming virus season, the CDC recommended everyone aged 75 and older receive a jab. People aged between 60 and 74 are recommended to receive one if they have certain chronic medical conditions, such as lung or heart disease. There was no recommendation for adults aged under 60, however. Pfizer shares had fallen 2.0% in New York. Hurting the FTSE 100, Anglo American fell 2.1%. Berenberg cut the stock to ’sell’ from ’hold’. Elsewhere in the mining sector, Rio Tinto and Glencore lost 0.7%. Back in London, Watches of Switzerland shares rallied 8.4%. It said it is ‘cautiously optimistic’ for its new financial year, after a tricky one just ended. For the year ended April 28, revenue was largely flat on-year at £1.54 billion. Pretax profit, however, fell 40% to £92.1 million from £154.8 million. ‘I am proud of the performance that our team delivered this year in what was undoubtedly a more challenging market. We cemented our position as a leading international luxury watch and jewellery retailer and delivered further market share gains in both the UK and US, driven by our proven, differentiated business model. In particular, our US business went from strength to strength, growing 11% and will soon represent half of group sales,’ Chief Executive Officer Brian Duffy said. Looking ahead, the luxury watches seller expects revenue of £1.67 billion to £1.73 billion for the new year. It added: ‘Following the more challenging trading conditions of FY24, we are cautiously optimistic about trading in FY25. The industry as a whole is being more conservative on production, which we believe is a responsible approach to the long-term stability of the luxury watch market.’ Outsourcer Serco climbed 6.1% after it upped guidance amid ‘good progress’ in the first half. It now expects underlying operating profit for 2024 of £270 million, its guidance raised from £260 million. The new guidance represents roughly an 8.4% increase from the £249 million achieved in 2023. ‘We have delivered a good performance in the first half, with progress in improving productivity and the underlying performance of our portfolio,’ CEO Mark Irwin said. ‘As we enter the second six months of the year, while mindful of a potential impact internationally from elections in 2024, we remain optimistic about the quality of our pipeline of potential new work to support our medium-term growth targets.’ Elsewhere in London, retailer Quiz slumped 24% as its UK sales continue to be hurt by cost of living pressures on consumer spending. Revenue between the start of April and end of May totalled £13.8 million, a decline of around 11% from £15.5 million. ‘Notwithstanding the continued difficult trading environment in the period, the group is encouraged by a 12% increase in demand for Quiz product in international territories and sales in Quiz stores being broadly comparable year-on-year on a like-for-like basis.

Amongst individual stocks, Rolls-Royce and Melrose took a hit following a forecast warning for Airbus. The FTSE 100 index traded 15.07 points lower, 0.2%, at 8,266.48. It has risen some 3.9% so far in the second-quarter of the year. The FTSE 250 was down 130.67 points, 0.6%, at 20,431.90, though the AIM All-Share fell 2.40 points, 0.3%, at 769.46. The Cboe UK 100 fell 0.4% to 822.43, the Cboe UK 250 lost 0.7% at 17,809.77, and the Cboe Small Companies was 0.2% lower at 16,862.67. In European equities on Tuesday, both the CAC 40 in Paris was down 0.8% and the DAX 40 in Frankfurt slumped 1.1%. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is called down 0.1%, the S&P 500 up 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.4%. It is a reversal in fortunes, after the Dow climbed on Monday, but the S&P and Nasdaq struggled, weighed down by tech shares. End of quarter nerves, particularly in US tech, has been a theme in equity markets so far this week. XTB analyst Kathleen Brooks commented: ‘Tech stocks, specifically the AI mega stocks, sold off sharply on Monday. Nvidia dropped more than 6% and is down more than 10% in the last five sessions, which is correction territory. As we mentioned on Monday, this was not driven by fundamental factors, in our view. The company is still expected to generate epic profits for this quarter. ‘However, Nvidia’s financial firepower is not impeding the force of the sell off. The question investors now need to ask is if the sell off has gone far enough since the stock is in correction territory, or if this is a structural shift lower, that will weigh on the major US indices and allow other regions and indices to play catch up?’ Tumbling in Paris, Airbus lost 11% after lowering its outlook. It dragged shares in London-listed jet engine maker Rolls-Royce and aerospace firm Melrose down with it. The duo were down 3.9% and 3.7%. The Paris-based aerospace manufacturer warned it would deliver fewer aircraft than previously planned in 2024 due to supply chain problems and booked a hefty charge relating to its satellite business. Airbus now intends to deliver around 770 commercial aircraft in 2024, down from the 800 it forecast at the beginning of the year. French politics remained in focus. President Emmanuel Macron came under strong criticism on Tuesday for warning a far-right or hard-left win in snap polls could spark a ‘civil war’, with his opponents urging him not to scare the public. France is preparing to vote on Sunday in the country’s most polarising ballot in decades. Macron called the parliamentary polls after the far-right National Rally scored a runaway victory in European Parliament elections earlier this month. The election is shaping up as a showdown between the far-right RN and the left-wing New Popular Front, which is dominated by the hard-left France Unbowed. Macron warned on Monday that the programmes of the two ‘extremes’ could spark a ‘civil war’, accusing both the RN and France Unbowed of sowing tensions and dividing people. Leaders of both left and right condemned his remarks. In the UK, the Conservative party has withdrawn support from candidates Craig Williams and Laura Saunders after they were implicated in the General Election betting row. PM Rishi Sunak acted after coming under mounting pressure within the party to take a tougher stance on the alleged use of inside information to bet on the timing of the July 4 poll. But a Conservative Party spokesman said: ‘As a result of ongoing internal inquiries, we have concluded that we can no longer support Craig Williams or Laura Saunders as parliamentary candidates at the forthcoming general election. ‘We have checked with the gambling commission that this decision does not compromise the investigation that they are conducting, which is rightly independent and ongoing.’ The pound was quoted at $1.2688 early Tuesday afternoon in London, barely budging from $1.2691 at the time of the European equities close on Monday. The euro stood at $1.0723, down from $1.0728. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥159.39, falling from JP¥159.69. Back in London, Funding Circle added 10%. It has struck a deal to sell its US business, allowing the small and medium enterprise loans platform to focus on its UK offering. It will sell its US arm to iBusiness Funding LLC for £33 million in cash. The sale includes all loan portfolios. ‘The proceeds from the transaction will be reviewed in line with our capital allocation framework,’ it said. The transaction is expected to close by the end of June. Funding Circle Chief Executive Lisa Jacobs added: ‘In March, I announced that we were simplifying the business by exiting the US and focusing on profitable growth in the UK business. Alongside the UK restructuring actions announced in May, we are continuing to execute against this plan with the sale of the US business to IBF. The UK business is on track to be profitable in H2, in line with our guidance.’ On AIM, engineering firm Pressure Technologies fell 11% after a ‘mixed’ first-half. Chief Executive Officer Chris Walters said: ‘Precision Machined Components performed well in the period, with much-improved revenue and profitability, underpinned by operational improvements and capital investment. We expect this momentum to continue throughout the second half. Performance at Chesterfield Special Cylinders was impacted by the deferral of UK defence contract revenues into future years and by operational delays, including unplanned downtime for process-critical equipment in the first quarter.’ The CEO warned that while CSC will have a better second half, the first half shortfall will not be recovered. Walters added: ‘[The] full-year performance will be further impacted by delayed order placement for new hydrogen storage contracts due to the UK general election, now expected later in FY24.’ Revenue in the first half grew 9.2% to £15.0 million from £13.8 million. Its pretax loss narrowed to £1.2 million from £1.4 million. Brent oil was quoted at $84.65 a barrel early Tuesday afternoon, down from $85.07 at the London equities close Monday.

Shares in Halfords cheapened 5% to 142.8p as the Worcestershire-based retailer issued a cautious outlook for full year 2025, calling out low consumer confidence around discretionary purchases as well as rising freight and wage costs. RETAIL PRESSURES PERSIST While group revenue grew 7.9% to £1.7 billion last year, adjusted pre-tax profit plunged 18.3% to £36.1 million, towards the lower end of previously downgraded guidance, as weak consumer demand and higher costs crunched earnings. Halfords’ Autocentres garage business delivered another strong performance, but this was more than offset by a decline in its retail operations as the post-pandemic cycling boom continued to unwind and cash-strapped drivers delayed spending on new tyres. Faster-than-expected consolidation of the cycling market has driven higher levels of discounting and put pressure on   gross margins, but the hard-pressed retailer expects to emerge in an even stronger position once market conditions normalise and believes a consumer tyre market recovery would provide ‘significant opportunity for revenue growth’. CAUTIOUS OUTLOOK WEIGHS Halfords warned trading in the new financial year has remained ‘soft’, impacted by low consumer confidence around big-ticket, discretionary purchases, and poor spring weather, which has reduced store footfall and crimped cycling and staycation product sales. The company now expects market volumes to decline in cycling and consumer tyres this year, and to remain broadly flat in motoring servicing and retail motoring products. EXPERT VIEWS With a ‘sell’ rating on the stock, Liberum Capital commented: ‘Full year 2024 was a year of mishaps: lack of internal controls led to material prior-year adjustments, several cuts to forecasts, a noteworthy bid rebuffed by the board, but having not even taken it to shareholders now looks like an own goal.’ The broker continued: ‘The result is an abysmal share price performance, cloudy outlook, and a lack of confidence in delivery.’ Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: ‘Halfords needs a complete overhaul and is ripe for an activist investor to come along and make demands. The shares are trading at a two-year low and 75% below their peak in 2015. It’s clear that the auto services arm is the future of the business and Halfords already has a strategy in place to make this bigger. ‘The opportunity lies in speeding up this transition and working out how to fix the retail side, which might simply be to scale back the cycling bit with a smaller range of products and focus more on core motoring items.’ DISCLAIMER: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in this article owns Shares magazine.

If the shares hold onto their overnight gains, they are expected to open around the highs of the year at $290, representing a 15% gain, in line with the S&P 500 index. Positive sentiment spilled over into shares of rival  United Postal Service (UPS:NYSE)  which ticked up 2.4% after hours. COST CUTTING AND CONSOLIDATION For the three months to the end of May, fourth-quarter revenue rose slightly to $22.1 billion and adjusted EPS (earnings per share) grew 7.2% to $5.41, ahead of analysts’ expectations of $5.35 per share. Chief executive Raj Subramaniam described the full results as ‘unprecedented in the current environment’, adding ‘we expect this momentum to continue into fiscal 2025’. For fiscal 2025, the company guided for mid-single digit revenue growth and EPS in the range of $20 to $22 implying a slight upgrade against consensus estimates of $20.92. FedEx is in the middle of a sweeping cost-cutting programme aimed at saving $4 billion by the end of fiscal 2025, which Subramaniam confirmed was on track after delivering $1.8 billion in fiscal 2024. Further cost savings of $2 billion are anticipated following the company’s DRIVE transformation programme, announced in April 2023, to consolidate air and ground services into a unified business amid activist pressure to improve performance. Chief financial officer John Dietrich said the newly-consolidated business is expected to be a big driver of margin improvement in 2025. The company said it expected to buyback up to $2.5 billion shares in fiscal 2025 and earlier this month (11 June) the board approved a 10% hike in the quarterly dividend to $1.38 per share which equates to an annual payout of $5.52 per share. FedEx has more than doubled its dividend since 2021 and conducted share buybacks worth $5.74 billion, equivalent to around 12% of its current market capitalisation. You can opt out at any time."},

While the electric guitar, drum kit and piano purveyor’s results for the year ended 31 March 2024 showed a 5% drop in revenue to £144.4 million, this reflected a deliberate strategy to prioritise and protect margins in a weak consumer environment. HITTING THE RIGHT NOTES , which sells own-brand musical instruments and equipment alongside premium third-party brands including  Fender ,  Yamaha  and  Roland , swung from losses of £400,000 to a pre-tax profit of £600,000 last year with the help of cost-cutting and a 160 basis-point uptick in gross margins to 27.3%. The York-based company drummed up a 34% rise in adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) to £9.9 million, while net debt halved year-on-year, reducing from £14.5 million to a better-than-expected £7.3 million. Investors were also heartened to hear Gear4music’s recent foray into the second-hand market was already demonstrating ‘strong growth potential’. WHAT DID THE CEO SAY? Andrew Wass, who will soon move from the role of chief executive to executive chair and hand over the baton to Gareth Bevan, commented: ‘Having delivered the key objectives we set ourselves at the beginning of full year 2024, the group is well positioned to relaunch its profitable growth strategy for full year 2025. This will focus on expanding sales verticals and channels to market whilst further enhancing and leveraging our unique bespoke e-commerce platform and product offering.’ Wass added: ‘International revenue growth faced some localised challenges in full year 2024. However, the board is confident that, through our ongoing actions and new initiatives such as our second-hand proposition, European sales are set to start recovering in full year 2025.’ THE EXPERT’S VIEW Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: ‘Gear4music has been singing the wrong notes for investors in recent years, joining the brigade of companies suffering from a post-pandemic growth splutter. ‘While sales dipped in its latest results, there was an improvement in earnings, helped by margin gains and cost base reductions. That’s put the company on a stronger footing and investors raced to buy the shares in response, a big change of fortunes given the stock has been trading at a bombed-out level for a couple of years.’ Mould continued: ‘This shift in fortunes coincides with a changing of the guard, with some directors leaving and others switching roles. It appears that the results are strong enough to stick Gear4music on the list of turnaround candidates so don’t be surprised to see more people singing its praises going forward. That’s as long as the latest stroke of good luck is not a one-off.’ DISCLAIMER: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in this article owns Shares magazine.

UK engineering companies such as  Rolls-Royce  ( )  and  Melrose  ( ) , together with European manufacturers like  MTU Aero Engines (MTX:FRA)  and  Safran (SAF:EPA) , supply key parts for Airbus aircraft. Shares in Rolls-Royce, which have gained almost 60% year-to-date, dipped 16p or 3.5% to 455p, while Melrose   shares lost 25p or 4.5% to 556p. Shares in Airbus itself fell €16 or 11% to a six-month low of €133, wiping more than €10 billion from the group’s market value. SUPPLY CHAIN SNAGS When it reported its first-quarter results in April, Airbus said it expected to deliver 800 commercial aircraft this year and to report adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) of between €6.5 billion and €7 billion. However, on its website the company updated its guidance to around 770 deliveries and an adjusted EBIT target of ‘around’ €5.5 billion due to persistent supply-chain issues in engines, aerostructures and cabin equipment which have slowed aircraft production. The firm also delayed its monthly production target of 75 A320 narrow-body aircraft by a year from 2026 to 2027, although it kept its A330 wide-body and A350 output forecasts. Airbus had widely been seen as winning ground from US rival  Boeing (BA:NYSE)  as the latter struggles with production issues on its 737 MAX jets following several incidents earlier this year, leaving airlines scrambling for aircraft to meet strong demand for international travel. The European firm also revealed it would take a €900 million charge in its first-half results for issues in its space division where it has ‘reassessed’ the risks and costs of some of its programmes.

In the UK, Prudential shares were in fashion, after it started its $2 billion share buyback. Elsewhere in London SIG shares closed lower, after it slashed its profit guidance. The FTSE 100 index closed up 43.83 points, 0.5%, at 8,281.55. The FTSE 250 ended up 120.22 points, 0.6%, at 20,562.57, and the AIM All-Share closed down 0.71 of a point, 0.1%, at 771.86. In European equities on Monday, the CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX 40 in Frankfurt both ended up 1.0%. In European equities on Monday, the CAC 40 in Paris ended up 1.1%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt ended up 1.0%. The main focus of the week is the US personal consumption data, which is due out on Friday. ‘The big economic news comes at the end of this week with a reading of US core PCE inflation – the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of prices. ‘Investors will be looking for signs the inflationary pressure which has led to a ratcheting back of expectations on interest rate cuts are starting to ease,’ said AJ Bell’s Russ Mould. Stocks in New York were mixed at the London equities close, with the DJIA up 1.0%, the S&P 500 index up 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.2%. The pound was quoted at $1.2691 at the London equities close Monday, higher compared to $1.2628 at the close on Friday. The euro stood at $1.0728 at the European equities close Monday, up against $1.0685 at the same time on Friday. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥159.69, higher compared to JP¥159.52 late Friday. In the FTSE 100, Prudential shot up 7.4%. On Monday, the Asia-focused insurer kicked off the first trance of a $2 billion share buyback and said progress towards its 2027 financial objectives will ‘increase the potential for further cash returns to shareholders’. The buyback will run to no later than mid-2026. UBS said the buyback is ‘earlier and marginally greater than its expectations’. The Swiss bank had expected a $1.8 billion buyback alongside first half results in June. In the FTSE 250, Britvic rose 7.1%. Suitor Carlsberg announced an agreement with PepsiCo, removing a potential obstacle as it attempts to buy Britvic. Danish brewer Carlsberg said US drinks firm PepsiCo has agreed to waive a so-called change-of-control clause as part of its long-term bottling agreement with British soft drinks group Britvic. This waiver will come into effect should an acquisition of Britvic by Carlsberg proceed to completion. The clause was viewed effectively as a poison-pill arrangement that could have prevented an acquisition of Britvic by allowing Pepsi to end its bottling deal, making the UK company a less attractive takeover target. So far, soft drinks manufacturer Britvic, the maker of Robinsons and famed for its ’posh tonics’, has rebuffed approaches from Carlsberg. Amongst London’s small-caps, SIG closed up 5.3%, after it warned full-year operating profit would be below current City expectations. The Sheffield-based supplier of insulation, roofing, commercial interiors and construction products said market conditions have remained challenging in the calendar year to date. As a result, SIG expects 2024 full year underlying operating profit to be in the range £20 million to £30 million, below the current analyst range. SIG put the analyst range at between £36.7 million to £43.0 million, as of Friday. On AIM, Empyrean Energy soared 53%. The oil & gas exploration and production company said it has entered a binding gas sale agreement with a subsidiary of Indonesia’s national oil company PT Pertamina.

The FTSE 100 index traded 5.88 points higher, 0.1%, at 8,287.43. The FTSE 250 was down 57.93 points, 0.2%, at 20,504.64, though the AIM All-Share fell 0.72 of a point, 0.1%, at 771.14.

Nvidia was among the worst hit by the tech sell-off, with the chipmaker slumping 6.7%. However, major names in banking, oil, retail and consumer goods ending higher in a sigh of rotation away from tech. Goldman Sachs, Chevron, Coca-Cola and Walmart all rose. In China on Tuesday, the Shanghai Composite ended 0.4% lower, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was flat in late trade. The Nikkei 225 ended 1.0% higher, and the S&P/ASX 200 shot up 1.4%. The pound was quoted at $1.2692 early Tuesday in London, barely budging from $1.2691 at the time of the European equities close on Monday. The euro stood at $1.0729, flat from $1.0728. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥159.46, falling from JP¥159.69. ‘The dollar remains sidelined ahead of two key event risks later this week. Thursday night sees the first presidential debate between President Biden and Donald Trump on CNN. It may be too early to expect this, but we will want to see whether the dollar responds to who ’wins’ the debate. A positive outcome for Trump could see the dollar edge higher. But the bigger market mover this week will be Friday’s core PCE inflation read. Should it meet expectations of a 0.1% month-on-month reading, we suspect the short-end of the US curve can come lower and take the dollar with it,’ analysts at ING commented. The US labour market is at a point where it could become a greater issue for the Federal Reserve going forward, a senior official at the central bank said Monday. So far, it has managed to sharply reduce inflation while causing only a slight easing to the labor market, and the unemployment rate to remain close to a half-century low. But historical data suggest that this ‘benign outcome’ could be less likely in future, with the potential for a greater rise in unemployment, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said Monday. ‘Going forward, this tradeoff may not be as favourable,’ Daly, who has a vote on the Fed’s rate-setting committee this year, said in prepared remarks for an event in San Francisco. She highlighted the relationship between job vacancies in the economy and the unemployment rate – known as the Beveridge curve – saying it suggests that ‘future labour market slowing could translate into higher unemployment, as firms need to adjust not just vacancies but actual jobs.’ In London, Admiral was the best FTSE 100 performer, rising 2.5%. Berenberg lifted the insurer to ’buy’ from ’hold’. Peer Direct Line traded flat, after the German bank cut it to ’hold’ from ’buy’. Aerospace firms struggled. Melrose lost 4.8% and Rolls-Royce fell 3.5%. The duo were the worst large-cap performers in London after a negative read across from Paris-listed Airbus. Airbus said late Monday it would deliver fewer aircraft than previously planned in 2024 due to supply chain problems. It also announced it would book a charge of €900 million for its satellite business. ‘In commercial aircraft, Airbus is facing persistent specific supply chain issues mainly in engines, aerostructures and cabin equipment,’ the company said in a statement. It said it now intends to deliver around 770 commercial aircraft in 2024, down from the 800 it forecast at the beginning of the year. It delivered 735 commercial aircraft last year. Airbus shares slumped 8.3% in Paris. In Frankfurt, Merck KGaA slumped 9.8%. The pharmaceutical firm said it has discontinued a phase three probe of the xevinapant drug in locally advanced head and neck cancer. ‘The company decided to discontinue this study. The decision follows a pre-planned interim analysis performed by the study’s Independent Data Monitoring Committee, which found that the trial would be unlikely to meet its primary objective of prolonging event-free survival,’ it said. Back in London, Funding Circle jumped 17%. It has struck a deal to sell its US business, allowing the finance provider to small business finance firm to focus on its UK offering. It will sell its US arm to iBusiness Funding LLC for £33 million in cash. The sale includes all loan portfolios. ‘The proceeds from the transaction will be reviewed in line with our capital allocation framework,’ it said. The transaction is expected to close by the end of June. Funding Circle Chief Executive Lisa Jacobs added: ‘In March, I announced that we were simplifying the business by exiting the US and focusing on profitable growth in the UK business. Alongside the UK restructuring actions announced in May, we are continuing to execute against this plan with the sale of the US business to IBF. The UK business is on track to be profitable in H2, in line with our guidance.’ Brent oil was quoted at $85.03 a barrel early Tuesday, down slightly from $85.07 at the London equities close Monday.

The Asia-focused insurer kicked off the first trance of a $2 billion share buyback and said progress towards its 2027 financial objectives will ‘increase the potential for further cash returns to shareholders’. Prudential Chief Executive Anil Wadhwani commented: ‘I am pleased with the progress we continue to make in executing our strategy, as we drive towards generating growth in both value and cash returns for shareholders over the long term. ‘The significant growth opportunity ahead of us has not changed and we remain focused on realising that opportunity.’ Wadhwani added that the firm’s dividend policy is unchanged, with it still targeting annual growth in the 7% to 9% range. Going forward, Prudential said it would seek to operate with a free surplus ratio of between 175% to 200%. The free surplus ratio, will be defined as the group’s capital resources, being free surplus (excluding intangibles) plus the European embedded value required capital of the life business, divided by the EEV required capital of the life business.

The buyback is expected to be completed no later than mid-2026 with the first $700 million tranche beginning today (24 June). Reflecting confidence in the future, the company said progress towards its 2027 objectives will increase the potential for further returns to shareholders. The shares are down around 12% year to date compared with an 7% gain in the blue-chip FTSE 100 index, reflecting poor sentiment towards China. WHY DID THE SHARES JUMP? Analysts at Jefferies said the share buyback is double what they were modelling but spread out over a longer timeframe than the six months they were anticipating. The company said its dividend policy remains unchanged with the board expecting the 2024 payout to grow in the 7% to 9% range. CEO Anil Wadhwani commented: ‘With our strong capital base, strategic progress and the recent clarification of the rating agencies' treatment of the IFRS17 CSM (contractual service margin), we can now provide a capital management update. ‘Our outperformance in H1 2023 when the border between Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland reopened results in a strong comparator for H1 2024. Q2 2024 APE (annual premium equivalent) sales trends are similar to those in Q1 2024. ‘Given our focus on quality growth in both value and cash and on account of the progress on execution of our strategy, we have confidence in our FY2024 new business growth and in achieving our 2027 financial and strategic objectives.’ The   is based on an assessment of the group’s free surplus capital position measured against a target range of 175% to 200%. ‘At the end of 2023, our free surplus ratio was 242%.  Accordingly, and after taking into account the 2023 second Interim dividend, we have determined that we will return US$2 billion to shareholders’, the company explained.

The payments and logistics tie-up should ‘mutually enhance’ the retail operations of both companies and will include the sale of online health and beauty retailer THG’s protein powder in Frasers’ Sports Direct stores. As part of the strategic tie-up, THG has agreed to sell its luxury goods websites to Frasers and will support the FTSE 100 giant with courier management services and re-platforming its Australian fulfilment and logistics operations, supporting Frasers’ international growth push. A FIRST FOR FRASERS PLUS The   includes the integration of Frasers Plus, the Sports Direct to House of Fraser-owner’s credit and loyalty platform, into THG’s  Ingenuity  platform, which Frasers insists will benefit customers across THG retail sites and also marks the first Frasers Plus partnership with an external partner. Frasers Plus has been integrated into  Ingenuity ’s checkout and will soon be available to both THG’s Beauty and Nutrition customers as well as to Ingenuity clients. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said Frasers has ‘already shown it is good at selling products to consumers, now it wants to be a bigger player in the payments game. Having THG as a partner gives it a shop window to show off its skills and potentially encourage more shopkeepers to sign up.’ Coatsworth continued: ‘Frasers is hoping third party retailers will use its buy now, pay later product as that would provide an additional income stream. The proposition is already live with Frasers’ own retail brands and signing up THG is a big step forward as it represents its first external partner.’ COGGLES CHANGES HANDS THG has also agreed to sell its portfolio of luxury goods websites including www.coggles.com to Frasers, although the  Ingenuity  platform will continue to support the Coggles brand portfolio across technology, digital marketing and fulfilment services post-sale. Frasers’ chief executive Michael Murray said the partnership marked ‘an exciting step towards our Frasers Plus ambitions as we look to expand its offering across additional third-party platforms’. THG chief executive Matthew Moulding said he was delighted to be partnering with Frasers ‘across a broad range of initiatives, in particular bringing Frasers Plus to consumers shopping with  Ingenuity  clients, as well as to our own retail sites including Lookfantastic, Cult Beauty and Myprotein.’ Moulding added: ‘Our luxury brand portfolio including Coggles has grown from a standing start eleven years ago, and we are eager to watch it develop further as an  Ingenuity  client.’ THG ON TRACK THG’s shares ticked up 2.6% to 63.5p, still some 90% below 2020’s 500p IPO (initial public offering) price, on the positive trading update twinned with the partnership news. Reassuringly, Manchester-based THG left its year-to-December 2024 guidance unchanged and stressed that the current second quarter wouldl mark its third consecutive period of year-on-year sales growth. Performance at THG has been underpinned by positive trading within its Beauty, external  Ingenuity  and offline Nutrition businesses, which have helped offset continuing currency headwinds within Asia, and sales growth is expected to accelerate in the second half.

So says Louis Navellier, chief investment officer at Navellier & Associates, the analysis firm he founded and runs. Navellier predicts that Nvidia stock could smash the $200 mark in 2025. Nvidia has already experienced a meteoric rise, yet Navellier thinks that if the Santa Clara, California company can get its next generation Blackwell chips into production on track in 2025, the stock could break more Wall Street records. CRUCIAL NEXT GEN CHIP TECH A key factor in Nvidia’s dominance, according to Navellier, is its substantial investment in next generation generative AI chips. He claims that Nvidia’s $2 billion expenditure renders competitor efforts ‘increasingly futile’ due to Nvidia’s superior technology. Navellier goes as far as to suggest Nvidia is single-handedly leading the stock market, prompting Bloomberg TV to declare the S&P 500’s ‘Magnificent Seven’ has become ‘the Magnificent One and 499 other stocks.’ Navellier downplays recent news of antitrust investigations into Nvidia,  Microsoft (MSFT:NASDAQ) , and OpenAI by the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission. Citing a Wall Street Journal report, Navellier noted that these investigations ‘may ultimately come to nothing’ and will not impede the progress of AI. WALL STREET RECORDS FALL Nvidia has already broken Wall Street records. It took  Apple (AAPL:NASDAQ)  about five years to bridge the $1 trillion to $3 trillion market cap gap, Microsoft about the same. Nvidia did it in barely a year. So, what would a $5 trillion market cap mean for valuation? Based on Koyfin’s fiscal 2027 (to 31 Jan) consensus data, the stock currently trades on a price to earnings ratio of around 30. Applying a $200 share price to those same forecasts would lift the 2027 PE to about 48. Crucial to future valuation will be the direction of forecasts, and whether they stay roughly where they are or shift higher over time. The latter seems likely given Nvidia’s run of forecast-beating quarterlies that has seen analysts rethink estimates time and again. Earnings and revenue estimates for the current year (to 31 Jan 2026) have doubled over the past 12 months, and fiscal 2027 estimates are already 30% higher than they were, implying that Wall Street analysts have been consistent under-egging Nvidia’s growth potential.

The FTSE 100 index traded 7.66 points higher, 0.1%, at 8,245.38. The FTSE 250 was down 50.12 points, 0.3%, at 20,392.23, though the AIM All-Share fell 0.41 of a point, 0.1%, at 772.16. The Cboe UK 100 rose 0.1% to 820.38, the Cboe UK 250 lost 0.2% at 17,744.56, and the Cboe Small Companies was 0.1% lower at 16,897.59. In European equities on Monday, both the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.3% and the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was rose 0.1%. In New York on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged marginally higher, though both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 0.2%. In Tokyo on Monday, the Nikkei 225 ended up 0.5%. In China, the Shanghai Composite fell 1.2%, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was 0.4% lower. In Sydney, the S&P/ASX 200 ended down 0.8%. US tech sector nerves kept enthusiasm to a minimum at the start of the week. Nvidia shares fell 4.0% last week. ‘Is this a brief hiccup, or the start of some air being let out of the balloon? Interestingly our very prescient equity strategists have put out a note over the weekend arguing for a breather in US markets partly due to stretched positioning and a buy back black-out starting next week ahead of Q2 earnings,’ Deutsche Bank analysts commented. The pound was quoted at $1.2655 early Monday, rising from $1.2628 at the time of the London equities close on Friday. The euro stood at $1.0712, up from $1.0685. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥159.69, up from JP¥159.52. In the UK, it is the final full week of campaigning before the July 4 general election. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will warn that it would take decades to recover from the ‘disaster’ of a Labour government as he seeks to rally Tories to fight for every vote in the closing stages of the campaign. The PM will tell activists they have just 10 days to ‘take our message to every corner of the UK’ before polls open a week on Thursday. With the Conservatives still around 20 points behind in the polls and after a bruising few days dominated by allegations about alleged insider betting, Sunak will urge Tories not to ‘surrender’ to Keir Starmer’s party. Over in France, President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday vowed a ‘change’ of governing style regardless of who wins the snap elections he called, as fresh polls indicated his centrist party may once again be trounced by the far right. Despite the prospect of a hung parliament, Macron insisted he would finish out his term until 2027, defying calls from opponents to step down in case the far-right National Rally, or RN, comes out on top. ‘The goal cannot be to just continue as things were,’ Macron said in an open letter published in French media. ‘I have heard that you want change. ‘You can trust me to act until May 2027 as your president, protector at every moment of our republic, our values, respectful of pluralism and your choices, at your service and that of the nation,’ he added. Marine Le Pen, the National Rally’s figurehead, said Saturday that Macron’s resignation could be the only solution to avoid a lame-duck presidency for the remaining three years of his term. Her comments came as two new opinion polls released showed the RN with 35-36% of voting intentions as the first round looms on June 30. They lead a left-wing alliance at 27-29.5%, with Macron’s centrists in third at 19.5-22%. Away from politics, US data will be in focus this week, with a gross domestic product reading on Thursday and the latest personal consumption expenditures data on Friday. ING analyst Francesco Pesole commented: ‘If the US May core PCE on Friday does come in at the consensus 0.1% month-on-month, the short-term downside for the dollar against European currencies may be less pronounced as markets could still favour defensive positions ahead of the French vote on Sunday. When taking EU political noise out of the equation, though, PCE data should in our view feed into an increasingly dovish Federal Reserve narrative this summer, culminating with a September rate cut. This is why we remain generally bearish on the dollar for the end of next quarter.’ In London, Prudential shares rose 5.1%, the best large-cap performer. The Asia-focused insurer announced a $2 billion share buyback programme.   The firm said the buyback will be completed by no later than mid-2026. Chief Executive Anil Wadhwani commented: ‘I am pleased with the progress we continue to make in executing our strategy, as we drive towards generating growth in both value and cash returns for shareholders over the long term. The significant growth opportunity ahead of us has not changed and we remain focused on realising that opportunity.’ The CEO said that Prudential’s progress towards its financial goals can ‘increase the potential for further cash returns to shareholders’. Wadhwani added that the firm’s dividend policy is unchanged, with it still targeting annual growth in the 7% to 9% range. Prudential’s annual premium equivalent ‘sales trends’ in the second-quarter as similar to the first, it added. They had risen 4.2% on-year in the first-quarter, or 7.3% at constant currency. THG added 1.5%, while Frasers climbed 0.8% as the duo unveiled a tie-up. The duo will partner ‘across several areas’. E-commerce firm THG’s Ingenuity offering will provide Frasers with ‘courier management services and re-platforming the Frasers Group’s Australian fulfilment and logistics operations’. The Frasers credit and loyalty platform, Frasers Plus, is integrated into Ingenuity. In addition, a selection of THG’s Myprotein products will be launched instore at Sports Direct. ‘The launch across Sports Direct stores further supports the success of the recent rebrand and the offline growth potential of the brand. Launching collaboration products through Sports Direct further broadens the Myprotein brand appeal, bringing the rapidly growing Hyrox community to both Myprotein and Sports Direct alike,’ THG added. THG said it has agreed to sell its portfolio of luxury goods websites, including fashion site Coggles, to Frasers. THG left its annual outlook unchanged as ‘positive momentum’ at the end of last year continued in the first half of this one. On current trading, THG said the second-quarter will represent the ‘third consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue growth’. Britvic shares rose another 7.6% as suitor Carlsberg weighs up its next move. The brewer, whose attempts so far at acquiring the FTSE 250-listed soft drinks maker have been rebuffed, reported an agreement with PepsiCo. Carlsberg said PepsiCo has agreed to waive the change of control clause in bottling arrangements it has with Britvic. ‘This waiver will come into effect should an acquisition of Britvic by Carlsberg, which has the recommendation of Britvic’s board, proceed to completion. Carlsberg is considering its position. There can be no certainty that any offer will be made,’ Carlsberg added. The Times reported Friday that Carlsberg is preparing a third bid for Britvic, upping the ante to £3.58 billion. Its most recent proposal, which valued Britvic’s issued and to be issued equity at £3.20 billion, was deemed unsatisfactory by the London-listing’s board.

The FTSE 100 index traded 63.83 points lower, 0.8%, at 8,209.15. The FTSE 250 was down 104.78 points, 0.5%, at 20,393.94, although the AIM All-Share was up 0.40 of a point, 0.1%, at 772.78.

In European equities on Friday, the CAC 40 slipped 0.7% and the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was down 0.6%. The downbeat mood looks set to spread to Wall Street. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite are expected to open 0.1% lower. The S&P 500 is predicted to open down 0.2%.

The euro slipped to $1.0678 midday London time, from $1.0713 at the time of the European equities close Thursday. Against the yen, the dollar rose to JP¥158.99 from JP¥158.71. UK economic data was mixed on Friday. Retail sales increased at a faster pace than expected last month, but business activity expanded at its slowest pace since November, data showed. According to the Office for National Statistics, UK retail sales volumes surged 2.9% in May from April, topping the FXStreet cited consensus of a 1.5% rise. Sales had declined 1.8% in April from March. April’s outcome was upwardly revised from an initially-reported 2.3% decline. Rob Wood at Pantheon Macroeconomic said it was a strong rebound from April‘s ‘rain-sodden disaster’. Wood highlighted the ‘enormous volatility’ in the figures. ‘Retail volumes were not collapsing in April and neither are they booming now,’ he observed. Nonetheless, Wood expects further increases in disposable income to feed through strongly to overall spending. Despite the uptick in sales, retailers were generally a weak feature in London. B&M European Value Retail fell 2.2%, Marks & Spencer slipped 1.7% and Frasers dipped 1.3%. B&M was further knocked by a rating downgrade by Morgan Stanley to ’underweight’. Elsewhere, figures from S&P Global showed UK private sector growth eased to its slowest pace since November this month, despite the manufacturing economy enjoying its best showing in almost two years. The latest flash UK composite purchasing managers’ index fell to 51.7 points in June, from May’s final tally of 53.0 points. The market consensus was for an unchanged reading. S&P noted the improved showing in manufacturing was offset by a slowing of service sector growth. ‘Services activity grew at its softest pace for seven months, although survey evidence indicated that the slowdown was partly driven by a pause in client spending decisions during the election period,’ S&P said. The manufacturing PMI expanded to a 23-month-high of 51.4 points in June’s flash estimate, edging up from 51.2 in May. The services PMI declined to a seven-month-low of 51.2 points, however, from 52.9. In Europe, the private sector suffered a growth slowdown at the end of the second-quarter, with the manufacturing economy remaining in decline. The latest Hamburg Commercial Bank flash purchasing managers’ index fell to a three-month-low of 50.8 points in June, from May’s final reading of 52.2 points. The 50.0 mark separates growth from decline. ‘The eurozone’s economic recovery suffered a setback at the end of the second quarter of the year, according to provisional PMI survey data. New orders decreased for the first time in four months, feeding through to softer expansions in business activity and employment. Meanwhile, business confidence dipped to the lowest since February. Rates of input cost and output price inflation eased to six- and eight-month lows respectively,’ survey publisher S&P Global said. In the FTSE 100, only seven stocks were in positive territory at midday. Of those, United Utilities rose 1.6% and Seven Trent advanced 0.9% as JPMorgan took the plunge and turned more positive on the UK water sector for the first time since it turned cautious in 2022. The investment bank believes share prices now reflect headwinds but don’t account for more upbeat outcomes. ‘We believe that the market underappreciates certain positives, especially for companies like United Utilities and Severn Trent, with a long track record of outperforming regulatory allowances, which we expect to continue,’ JPMorgan stated. JPM upgraded United Utilities to ’overweight’ from ’neutral’ and Severn Trent to ’neutral’ from ’underweight’. In the FTSE 250, Britvic jumped 5.8% after rejecting a 1,250 pence per share bid from Danish brewer, Carlsberg. The proposal from Carlsberg followed an initial 1,200p per share tilt earlier in June. Britvic, the soft drinks maker, known for its ‘posh tonics’ unanimously rejected the plan claiming it undervalued the business. Carlsberg said it was considering its position following the rejection and will make a further announcement. ‘The proposal represents a compelling opportunity for Britvic shareholders to realise their investment in full in cash at an attractive valuation,’ Carlsberg added. Looking forward, Britvic said it would continue to consider any further proposal, but that the board remained ‘confident’ in the current and future prospects of the company. Citi analyst Simon Hales questioned the logic behind Carlsberg’s move. ‘The overall strategic rationale of the transaction does not look compelling in our view,’ Hales said. He suggested the bid would be dilutive to sales growth and increase debt, prompting Carlsberg to stop its share buyback. The move for Britvic prompted gains for AG Barr, up 4.5% and Fevertree Drinks, up 3.6%. On AIM, Ondine Biomedical leapt 12% after reporting its nasal product Steriwave is now available through the UK NHS Supply Chain. The company said the availability makes it easier for NHS hospitals in England and Wales to purchase Steriwave. ‘This marks the first time a light-activated antimicrobial has been available through the NHS Supply Chain, a national body which manages the sourcing, delivery and supply of healthcare products to the NHS and healthcare organizations in England and Wales,’ Ondine said. Among London’s small caps, Gulf Keystone Petroleum rose 7.6% after hailing ‘robust’ crude sales from the Shaikan field to the Kurdistan market recently. Sales in the year-to-date total around 38,700 barrels of oil per day. In May alone, sales averaged 48,200 bopd but have eased to 40,500 so far in June. GKP declared a 6.832 US cents per share interim dividend, worth $15 million in total. GKP said it remains ‘committed’ to returning excess cash to shareholders with an ambition to ‘reinstate an appropriate distributions policy to provide shareholders with greater clarity on returns.’ A barrel of Brent oil fetched $85.59 around midday Friday, down from $85.77 late Thursday afternoon.

This would value Crimson Tide at around £21 million. Brent oil was quoted at $85.73 a barrel at the London equities close Friday, down from $85.57 late Thursday. Gold was quoted at $2,326.10 an ounce at the London equities close Friday, lower against $2,357.90 at the close on Thursday. In Monday’s UK corporate calendar, there are full year results for AO World. There are also half year results due out for Patria Private Equity Trust. The economic calendar for Monday is looking quiet. The week will pick up on Tuesday with the US house price index and consumer confidence data. Copyright 2024 Alliance News Ltd.

The Danish brewer sweetened its original £12 per share offer to £12.50 on 11 June 2024, a proposal valuing Britvic at around £3.1 billion that represented a near-30% premium to the undisturbed share price. However, this raised offer was unanimously rejected by the board on 17 June on the basis it ‘significantly undervalues Britvic, and its current and future prospects’. Beer and lager giant Carlsberg is probably not the first company that springs to mind when compiling a list of potential buyers for soft drinks maker Britvic, but the brewer has clearly taken the view it needs to diversify to protect its future. , whose enviable brand portfolio includes Robinsons and Tango and which also makes Pepsi and 7UP for US drinks giant  PepsiCo (PEP:NASDAQ) , looked like a ripe opportunity potentially at a reasonable price. CONSIDERING ITS POSITION Carlsberg still believes a takeover would enable it to ‘capture appealing long-term growth opportunities from Britvic’s comprehensive portfolio of leading brands in an attractive segment of the beverage market’. The predator is now considering its position following the two rejected approaches and needs to decide how much it wants to own Britvic, since it will have to dig a lot deeper to win over the board and shareholders. As for Britvic, it said it will ‘consider any further proposal on its merits’, yet remains ‘confident’ in its current and future prospects as a standalone having served up a 12.8% rise in   to £78.2 million for the half ended 31 March as revenues bubbled up 11.2% to £880.3 million. Beneficiaries of today’s share price surge include the likes of  Schroder UK Mid Cap Fund  ( ) , which had 3.1% of its portfolio in Britvic at last count and is the only investment trust with 1% or more in the stock. In the open-ended funds universe,  VT Downing Small & Mid-Cap Income (B61JRG2)  has 3.65% of its portfolio invested in Britvic, according to Fe Fundinfo. THE EXPERT’S VIEW Russ Mould, AJ Bell investment director, commented: ‘Britvic believes its products are probably the best soft drinks in the world because it is not letting Carlsberg rock up and buy the company on the cheap. ‘Trading on just 15 times earnings before revealing the bid approach, Britvic is a classic example of a company that quietly got on with the job. There was no glamour around its products, investors didn’t hype up the stock, and it sat quietly on the UK market slowly growing sales and revenue. Often, it’s only when something is taken away that you miss it, and investors might take that view if Britvic was gobbled up and delisted.’ While Carlsberg is known for selling beer and lager, Mould said there have been hints it wants to diversify. A ‘Beyond Beer’ strategy is in place that has seen the company explore other avenues such as hard seltzers. ‘Britvic would effectively act as a springboard to accelerate that diversification and take the company into an adjacent market,’ added Mould. Carlsberg has ‘already dipped its toe into the water with soft drinks such as Tuborg Squash Light and Xixia Pineapple & C. Owning Britvic would turbocharge its position in this sector.’ DISCLAIMER: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in this article owns Shares magazine.

The pound struggled, however. Sterling was quoted at $1.2684 early Thursday afternoon, down from $1.2723 at the London equities close Wednesday. The FTSE 100 index traded 33.04 points higher, 0.4%, at 8,238.15. The FTSE 250 was up 82.07 points, 0.4%, at 20,463.12, though the AIM All-Share was down 2.31 points, 0.3%, at 775.19. The Cboe UK 100 rose 0.2% to 817.64, the Cboe UK 250 added 0.3% at 17,766.16, and the Cboe Small Companies was 1.1% higher at 16,897.78. In European equities on Thursday, both the CAC 40 in Paris shot up 0.9% and the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was up 0.7%. The euro slipped to $1.0730 midday London time, from $1.0745 at the time of the European equities close Wednesday. Against the yen, the dollar rose to JP¥158.42 from JP¥157.92. The BoE said seven members of its Monetary Policy Committee, Governor Andrew Bailey included, backed the decision to maintain bank rate at 5.25%. Swati Dhingra and Dave Ramsden were in favour of a 25 basis point cut. For the first time since July 2021, inflation returned to target, numbers on Wednesday showed. According to the Office for National Statistics, the rate of yearly consumer price growth faded to 2.0% in May, from 2.3% in April. The reading was in-line with the FXStreet cited consensus. The BoE said: ‘Indicators of short-term inflation expectations have also continued to moderate, particularly for households. CPI inflation is expected to rise slightly in the second half of this year, as declines in energy prices last year fall out of the annual comparison.’ The central bank also looked to play down the robust service inflation print outlined in Wednesday’s ONS data. ‘Services consumer price inflation was 5.7% in May, down from 6.0% in March, but somewhat higher than projected in the May report. This strength in part reflected prices that are index-linked or regulated, which are typically changed only annually, and volatile components,’ it said. Eyes now turn to August, with some hoping the first rate cut of the cycle may come then. The BoE said Thursday that it ‘has judged since last autumn that monetary policy needs to be restrictive for an extended period of time until the risk of inflation becoming embedded above the 2% target dissipates’. Still to come on Thursday’s economic calendar is a US jobless claims reading at 1330 BST. In London, DS Smith rose 1.3%. The London-based packaging firm reported weaker annual results, though it is the fate of suitor International Paper that hogged the spotlight. DS Smith said revenue in the year to April 30 declined 17% to £6.82 billion from £8.22 billion, sending pretax profit down 24% to £503 million from £661 million. ‘We are pleased to have delivered a robust performance, despite the challenging environment, driven by our focus on customers, quality, service and innovation together with the benefit from our self-help productivity initiatives,’ Chief Executive Officer Miles Roberts said. DS Smith maintained its final dividend at 12 pence per share, giving a full-year payout of 18p, also unmoved on-year. CEO Roberts told reporters that both sides are still ‘working very diligently on bringing the businesses together’, PA reported. Brazil’s Suzano last month confirmed its interest in acquiring International Paper. ‘However, it reiterates that, up to the moment, there is no agreement, binding or otherwise, nor any decision or deliberation by the company’s management regarding a potential operation that meets the minimum materiality required to qualify as a material fact,’ Suzano said in a US filing in May. Such a deal could threaten International Paper’s acquisition of DS Smith. Elsewhere in London, Speedy Hire shot up 8.1%. The Merseyside, England-based tool and equipment hire company won a long-term contract with Amey, which will generate up to £25 million revenue per year. Amey is provider of engineering, operations, and decarbonisation solutions for UK infrastructure. The company opted for Speedy Hire in part due to the two firms’ shared emphasis on sustainability, Speedy Hire said. YouGov plunged 36%. Since half-year results for the six months to January 31, released in March, the market research and data analytics firm said it has seen lower sales bookings than anticipated. As a result, YouGov now expects reported revenue for financial 2024 to be around £324 million to £327 million, up from £258.3 million in financial 2023. YouGov said it had invested in the business to set up for an acceleration in growth in the second half of the financial year, but this growth was below expectations. It now expects full-year group adjusted operating profit to be between £41 million to £44 million, down from £48.3 million in financial 2023. AJ Bell analyst Russ Mould noted that during election campaigns, the assumption might be that YouGov shines as it becomes a ubiquitous name when it comes to polling. ‘But its polling operation makes a relatively modest contribution to group revenue,’ Mould added. ‘The data analytics side is more important and this is where the company is struggling. The company invested for an expected acceleration of growth in the second half of its financial year which, in classic fashion, failed to materialise. This may reduce some of the clamour for the company to move its listing to the US in search of a higher rating. The one reassuring element of the announcement is the recently acquired consumer panel business is performing as expected.’ A barrel of Brent oil fetched $85.23 early Thursday afternoon, down from $85.77 late Wednesday afternoon.

The FTSE 100 index closed up 67.35 points, 0.8%, at 8,272.46. The FTSE 250 ended up 117.67 points, 0.6%, at 20,498.72, and the AIM All-Share closed down 5.12 points, 0.7%, at 772.38. The Cboe UK 100 ended up 0.8% at 822.72, the Cboe UK 250 closed up 0.7% at 17,849.09, and the Cboe Small Companies ended up 0.5% at 16,811.34. In European equities on Thursday, the CAC 40 in Paris ended up 1.3%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt ended up 1.0%. The Bank of England left the door ajar open for an August interest rate cut after saying June’s decision to leave bank rate unchanged was ‘finely balanced’. ING Developed Markets Economist James Smith said: ‘The Bank of England kept rates on hold this month, but comments in the statement and minutes suggest officials are getting closer to cutting interest rates despite some recent unwelcome services inflation figures.’ At its June meeting, the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-2 to keep bank rate at 5.25% for the seventh-successive meeting. The decision comes after numbers on Wednesday showed that inflation returned to the BoE’s target for the first time since July 2021. According to the Office for National Statistics, the rate of yearly consumer price growth faded to 2.0% in May, from 2.3% in April. The reading was in-line with the FXStreet cited consensus. The rate of inflation stood as high as 11.1% in October 2022, but has faded, albeit bumpily, since then. AJ Bell’s Laura Suter said: ‘Much of the public might have expected that once we hit the coveted 2% target for inflation the Bank would immediately start cutting rates. ‘Sadly, that’s not the case. Sticky core inflation and higher services inflation all helped to play into the Bank’s decision not to cut rates.’ The pound was quoted at $1.2675 at the London equities close Thursday, lower compared to $1.2723 at the close on Wednesday. The euro stood at $1.0713 at the European equities close Thursday, down against $1.0745 at the same time on Wednesday. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥158.71, higher compared to JP¥157.92 late Wednesday. In the FTSE 100, Ocado lost 13%, making it the worst performer of the day. Ocado shares dropped, after the firm said it will, alongside Sobeys, focus their joint resources into driving order and sales volumes across the current network instead of proceeding with plans for a new ’fulfilment centre’. The Hertfordshire, England-based grocery retailer and technology firm partnered with Sobeys, Canada’s second largest food retailer, in January 2018. Both companies agreed to launch an online grocery business in Canada using the end-to-end solutions within the Ocado Smart Platform. In the FTSE 250, CMC Markets shot up 8.5%. The London-based company is a provider of online trading and investment platforms spanning multiple asset classes, with a retail, professional and institutional offering. In the year that ended March 31, pretax profit rose 21% to £63.3 million from £52.2 million the previous year. Total revenue increased 11% to £359.7 million from £325.1 million. CMC increased its final dividend by 87% to 7.3 pence per share from 3.9p. This brings the total dividend to 8.3p, up 12% from 7.4p paid last year. On the other hand, Tate & Lyle lost 9.1%, after it announced a deal to acquire nature-based ingredients company CP Kelco US Inc. The London-based sweetener and food ingredients supplier said the $1.8 billion takeover of the Atlanta, Georgia-based company will create a ‘leading global speciality food and beverage solutions business’. Amongst London’s small-caps, Speedy Hire closed up 6.7%, after the Merseyside, England-based tool and equipment hire company announced the signing of a new long-term contract. The long-term contract with Amey Group Services will generate up to £25 million revenue per annum, Speedy Hire said, and is due to mobilise in the second of the current financial year, subject to a transition period. Stocks in New York were higher at the London equities close, with the DJIA up 0.2%, the S&P 500 index up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite up marginally higher. Brent oil was quoted at $85.57 a barrel at the London equities close Thursday, down from $85.77 late Wednesday. Gold was quoted at $2,357.90 an ounce at the London equities close Thursday, higher against $2,325.80 at the close on Wednesday.

The macroeconomic focus was retail sales data (18 June) for May which came in below forecasts, rising 0.1% month-on-month compared with 0.2% expected by economists. This follows a downward revision to April’s reading suggesting retail spending was lacklustre in the second quarter. Within the broad stock market strength, the technology heavy Nasdaq Composite index and small cap Russell 2000 indices lagged the S&P 500.   Despite the disparity at the index level, semiconductor stock  Super Micro Computer (SMCI:NASDAQ)  was the best performer in the S&P 500 over the week, gaining over 18%. AI was again in sharp focus as chip-maker  Nvidia (NVDA:NASDAQ)  overtook  Microsoft (MSFT:NASDAQ)  as the world’s most valuable company on Tuesday as its share price scaled a new all-time high. It’s market capitalisation reached $3.39 trillion following a 214% gain in the shares over the last 12-months.   ACCENTURE Having caught the market off-guard in March by missing second-quarter sales and earnings forecasts and lowering its full-year guidance, IT services and consulting firm  Accenture (ACN:NYSE)  had a lot of ground to make up with investors with this week’s third-quarter trading update. In the event, sales and EPS (earnings per share) narrowly missed analysts’ estimates again but the shares rallied sharply on the absence of a further downgrade and evidence of a growing order book thanks to demand for generative AI (artificial intelligence). ‘We achieved strong new bookings of over $21 billion, up 22% on last year, and continued to accelerate our strategy to be the reinvention partner of choice’, said chief executive Julie Sweet, as AI bookings year-to-date hit the $2 billion mark. For the fourth quarter to the end of August, Accenture predicted sales of between $16 billion to $16.65 billion, whereas analysts are forecasting sales in the region of $16.5 billion, towards the top end of the firm’s guidance. KROGER Food retailer  Kroger’s (KR:NYSE)  stock popped in pre-market trading following forecast beating first quarter earnings (20 June) before cheapening 3.3% to $50.3 as investors digested the impact promotions and lower prices will have on the supermarket operator’s margins. Sales grew 0.2% year-on-year to $45.3 billion in the quarter to 25 May amid robust demand for the downtown Cincinnati-based retailer’s cut-price groceries as cash-strapped consumers grapple with sticky inflation. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.43 came in below the previous year’s $1.51 but above the $1.35 Wall Street was looking for.   Confounding expectations of a guidance cut Kroger, whose planned $24.6 billion merger with smaller rival  Albertsons (ACI:NYSE)  remains under antitrust review, reaffirmed its full year same store sales and profit forecasts. ‘Kroger is off to a solid start in 2024 led by better than expected performance of our grocery business,’ said CEO Rodney McMullen, who insisted that his charge is delivering ‘exceptional value at a time when many customers need it more than ever, by providing affordable prices with personalised promotions’. CHEGG When a business seems locked into a terminal tailspin, grand plans to turn it round are likely to get cheered, and so it was at  Chegg (CHGG:NYSE)  over the past week. Having slumped 74% this year, the education technology firm announced a restructuring plan and a new vision for growth. Monday’s (17 Jun) 20% share price surge was a clear indication that investors want change, and change they’ll get. The Santa Clara, California-based company plans to axe 23% of its staff, with most of the cuts falling in content management teams in India and Israel, as well as its own US backyard. Chegg’s new chief executive Nathan Schultz said the reason for the plan was to ‘focus’ on their core student audience and make the company ‘more efficient.’ Time will tell. The education technology firm has had to face concerns that more students are turning to ChatGPT and elsewhere for help with homework and general learning, and it’s a big challenge. Chegg’s subscriber numbers fell 8% in the last quarter to 4.7 million and the company said at the time it will take some time to ‘bring these [subscriber] numbers back.’     You can opt out at any time."},

PROFIT FORECAST CUT Although the international online research and data analytics group saw an improvement in trading in the second half, growth was below expectations and the company now expects full-year group adjusted operating profit to be between £41 million and £44 million. Analysts had been forecasting between £57 million and £68 million of EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) for the year to this July.

There was a slew of M&A updates in early UK corporate news, adding some excitement before Threadneedle Street takes centre-stage. The FTSE 100 index traded 22.16 points higher, 0.3%, at 8,227.27. The FTSE 250 was up 65.85 points, 0.3%, at 20,446.90, though the AIM All-Share was down 3.11 points, 0.4%, at 774.39. The Cboe UK 100 rose 0.3% to 818.78, the Cboe UK 250 added 0.4% at 17,786.84, and the Cboe Small Companies was 0.1% higher at 16,751.73. In European equities on Thursday, both the CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX 40 in Frankfurt were up 0.5%. The pound was quoted at $1.2710 early Thursday, down from $1.2723 at the London equities close Wednesday. The euro slipped to $1.0733 from $1.0745. Against the yen, the dollar rose to JP¥158.23 from JP¥157.92. Threadneedle Street is expected to maintain UK bank rate at the 16-year high of 5.25% for the seventh-successive meeting on Thursday. It announces the rate decision at midday. Unlike the upcoming meeting in August, Thursday’s decision will not be accompanied by a monetary policy report with economic projections, nor a press conference with Governor Andrew Bailey. For those hoping for a summer rate cut, August, and not the June meeting, is likely to be the best bet. For the first time since July 2021, inflation returned to target, numbers on Wednesday showed. According to the Office for National Statistics, the rate of yearly consumer price growth faded to 2.0% in May, from 2.3% in April. The reading was in-line with the FXStreet cited consensus. Analysts at Lloyds Bank commented: ‘Although headline CPI inflation is back at target for the first time in nearly three years, the services side of the equation continues to run well ahead of that, slowing to only 5.7% year-on-year in May. That compares to 5.3% the BoE staff expected to be the case at this point. That overlays with high wage growth, which continues to defy generally softer labour market data (declining vacancies, rising unemployment/ shrinking employment). ‘You can make a good argument those elevated measures are lagging components, but from the MPC’s perspective that persistence still presents risks to the medium-term outlook. Consequently, the minutes of the June meeting will have very limited scope for any incrementally dovish developments. The market is pricing a 35% probability of a reduction in bank rate in August.’ Also in the economic calendar, there is eurozone consumer confidence data at 1500 BST. At 1330 BST, there is the US initial jobless claims data. In London, Sainsbury’s shares rose 1.6%, as it struck a deal to sell its core banking business to NatWest. Shareholders in the grocer stand to receive some cash as part of the deal. Sainsbury’s said it expects its bank arm to return excess capital of at least £250 million to the grocer once its phased withdrawal from it has been completed and a future model for Argos Financial Services is in place. Sainsbury’s intends to return this capital to shareholders. NatWest, meanwhile, explained Sainsbury’s Bank will pay it £125 million consideration as part of the transfer. The deal includes the grocer’s personal loan, credit card and retail deposit portfolios but not its commission income pact, including insurance, ATMs and travel money. Argos Financial Services is also not included in the deal and Sainsbury’s said it will update on plans for that division ‘at a future date’. NatWest added: ‘As part of the transaction, NatWest Group also expects to add around one million customer accounts.’ The deal is expected to have a 20 basis point impact on its common equity tier 1 ratio on completion. It will be earnings per share and return on tangible equity accretive from completion. Sainsbury’s in January had announced a phased withdrawal from its core banking business. Peer Tesco in February struck a deal to sell the retail banking business of Tesco Bank to Barclays. NatWest shares traded 0.8% higher. Elsewhere, Energean rose 6.9%. It said it will sell its portfolio in Egypt, Italy and Croatia to a Carlyle International Energy Partners-controlled entity in a deal worth up to $945 million. The exploration and production firm said deal proceeds will be enough to repay a $450 million corporate bond and allow for $200 million for a special dividend. ‘This sale enables Energean to rationalise the portfolio and focus on its gas-weighted, gas-development strategy, underpinned by the Karish Field in Israel and recent farm-in to the Anchois field in Morocco. This strategy aims to maximise asset monetisation (through a develop and operate model), free cash flow generation and returns to shareholders,’ Energean explained. ‘The transaction also optimises the portfolio by divesting later life assets, removing over 60% of the group’s decommissioning liabilities, and improving free cashflow generation in the short to medium-term.’ Alpha Financial Markets Consulting rose 3.6% as it agreed to a £626.0 million takeover by funds managed by Bridgepoint Advisers. Tate & Lyle lost 1.7% after it announced a deal to acquire nature-based ingredients company CP Kelco for $1.8 billion, in a move which will create a ‘leading global speciality food and beverage solutions business’. The deal will see JM Huber, a consumer and industrial products firm and current owner of CP Kelco, ‘become a long-term shareholder’ of Tate & Lyle, with a 16% stake on completion. The deal with JM Huber consists of a $1.15 billion cash portion funded from new and existing debt facilities and cash resources and $645 million from the issue of 75 million new Tate & Lyle shares. There is a deferred consideration of up to 10 million extra Tate & Lyle shares, subject to performance criteria. Away from the deal-making bonanza, CMC Markets shares jumped 9.3%. The online trading platform provider hailed strong annual results, which represented a ‘record-high outside the Covid-19 pandemic period’. Net operating income rose 15% to £332.8 million in the year to March 31, from £288.4 million. Pretax profit surged 21% to £63.3 million from £52.2 million. CMC Markets lifted its final dividend by 87% to 7.3 pence per share from 3.9p. It gives a total dividend for the year of 8.3p, up 12% from 7.4p. ‘Institutional, B2B and multi-asset, multi-currency platforms, across all brands is the future, and ours. We have built the infrastructure which will allow us to significantly increase our growth potential whilst improving profit margins through scale,’ Chief Executive Peter Cruddas said. ‘It is going to be an exciting couple of years.’ YouGov plunged 37% as the research and data analytics group warned on annual profit. ‘Following the half-year results, YouGov has seen lower sales bookings than anticipated,’ it cautioned. ‘In line with our stated strategy, the company had invested in the business to set up for an acceleration in growth in H2. While we have seen an improvement in the second half, the growth was below expectations.’ It now expects revenue between £324 million and £327 million for the year ending July and adjusted operating profit between £41 and £44 million. At best, the new outlook suggests a full-year revenue rise of 27%, but a profit fall of 8.9%. In Asia on Thursday, shares were largely lower. The Shanghai Composite ended down 0.4%, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong traded 0.6% lower. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.2%, though over in Sydney, the S&P/ASX 200 ended slightly lower. China’s benchmark lending rates were left unchanged on Thursday, as expected. The People’s Bank of China left the one-year loan prime rate - which serves as the benchmark for corporate loans - unchanged at 3.45%. The five-year LPR - which is used to price mortgages - was left at 3.95%. It had been cut from 4.20% in February, in an effort to stimulate the country’s flagging housing market. The loan prime rate is a lending reference rate set monthly by 18 banks. Back in August 2019, the PBoC revamped the mechanism to price loan prime rate, loosely pegging it to the medium-term lending facility. Earlier this week, the PBoC left the one-year medium-term lending facility rate unchanged at 2.50%. Pantheon Macroeconomics analyst Kelvin Lam said: ‘In all, we still see a reasonable chance of a symbolic cut in both the MLF rate and the LPR in the coming months.’ A barrel of Brent oil fetched $85.07 early Thursday, down from $85.77 late Wednesday afternoon.

The cash and shares transaction should sweeten Tate & Lyle’s margins over the next few years and makes strategic sense, since it creates a market leader in ‘mouthfeel’ - literally the way food or drink feels in the mouth - and the two ingredients firms share the same client base. However, Tate & Lyle shares slipped 3.5% lower to 653.5p on the news with the scale of the deal making some investors nervous, since large acquisitions have a nasty habit of destroying rather than creating shareholder value. SWEET ON CP KELCO CP Kelco is a sizeable player in pectin, speciality gums and other nature-based ingredients that generates half of its sales in the US and the balance from emerging markets and Europe. The company’s selling shareholder Hubert will get a 16% stake in Tate & Lyle and receive two seats on the board of the FTSE 250 group. While some investors may be concerned over integration risks, the acquisition is a complementary one for Tate & Lyle, since CP Kelco sells to the same group of clients in the main.  says the deal will enable it to grow at the high end of management’s 4% to 6% like-for-like growth range and generate at least $50 million in synergies in the first two years. The food producer said the acquisition expands its offering in a $19 billion and fast-growing speciality food and beverage ingredients addressable market and will be ‘accretive to adjusted earnings per share, including cost synergies only, in the second full financial year following completion, and strongly accretive thereafter’. WHAT DID THE CEO SAY? Over the past six years, Tate & Lyle has executed a major strategic transformation to become a growth-focused speciality food and beverage solutions business, which was completed with the announcement on 23 May 2024 of the proposed sale of its remaining 49.7% interest in Primient. Following completion of the CP Kelco acquisition, cash-generative Tate & Lyle insisted it will remain within its long-term target leverage range ‘with the capacity and flexibility for further investment’. The recently announced £215 million  , which was due to follow completion of Primient stake sale, has been pulled forward to today. ‘Following on from the announcement of the proposed sale of our remaining interest in Primient last month, the proposed combination with CP Kelco represents a significant acceleration of our growth-focused strategy,’ commented CEO Nick Hampton. ‘It creates a leading, global speciality food and beverage solutions business, ideally placed to benefit from the structural trends towards more plant-based, clean-label and sustainable ingredients and solutions. The growth potential of the proposed combined business is significant and we look forward to the future with confidence and excitement.’ THE EXPERT’S VIEW AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould highlighted that the CP Kelco deal is being funded through a mixture of debt and existing cash, so there is ‘the potential for some strain on Tate & Lyle’s balance sheet. However, the decision to press ahead with a previously announced share buyback programme is a sign of confidence on this front. ‘A lot will ride on the company’s ability to deliver the cost savings from combining operations and the promised improvements in revenue growth and margins,’ said Mould. ‘Often a management team overestimates what they can do on this front and ends up disappointing investors. At least Tate & Lyle is buying a business it knows well, having collaborated with it over a long period. That might reduce the risk that it discovers some skeletons in the cupboard when it takes charge.’ DISCLAIMER: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in this article owns Shares magazine.

The FTSE 100 index was up 4.76 points, or 0.1%, at 8,195.96. The FTSE 250 was up 38.44 points, or 0.2%, at 20,448.68, and the AIM All-Share was up 1.75 points, or 0.2%, at 780.07. The Cboe UK 100 was flat at 815.64, the Cboe UK 250 was up 0.2% at 17,805.81, and the Cboe Small Companies was up 0.4% at 16,689.73. Local stocks ticked higher, after data showed that the UK has dropped back to the 2% Bank of England target for the first time since July 2021. According to the Office for National Statistics, the rate of yearly consumer price growth faded to 2.0% in May, from 2.3% in April. The reading was in-line with the FXStreet cited consensus. The rate of inflation stood as high as 11.1% in October 2022, but has faded, albeit in a bumpy fashion, since then. The rate of inflation last sat at the target range back in July 2021. The data will give the BoE some food for thought, ahead of Threadneedle Street’s interest rate decision at midday on Thursday. No change to bank rate, currently at a 16-year high of 5.25%, is expected. However, the cooler inflation readings could open the door for a summer rate cut. ‘We think that the clear signs of progress towards the BoE’s inflation target may be enough to elicit a dovish tweak in the MPC’s communications on Thursday. There will be no press conference this month, but the statement could hint that a first UK rate cut may be on the way in August,’ said Ebury analyst Matthew Ryan commented. Separate data showed UK producer input prices decline 0.1% annually in May, easing from a 1.4% fall in April. On a monthly basis, producer input prices were flat in May, but topped expectations of a 0.2% fall. Prices had risen 0.8% in April from March. On the UK election front, Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves will outline how Labour’s energy policies will aim to save £300 for families, while Prime Minister Rishi Sunak embarks on his ‘moral mission’ to cut taxes, as campaigning continues. Reeves will visit the South West and accuse the Conservatives of being ‘staggeringly out of touch with the struggles facing ordinary families’ in comments ahead of the release of May’s inflation data. The Tories, meanwhile, reiterated their demand that Keir Starmer rule out a series of potential tax measures which they claim would be needed to fill a ‘£38.5 billion black hole’ in Labour’s plans. Sunak’s party republished a list of 17 tax hikes they say Labour could make, but the ppposition has said they would refuse to be drawn into the trap of responding to each claim. Meanwhile, in European equities on Wednesday, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 0.7%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was down 0.3%. Eurozone construction output declined on both an annual and monthly basis in April, numbers on Wednesday showed. According to Eurostat, construction production in the single currency area weakened 0.2% in April from May. Production had fallen 0.5% in March from February. Annually, output slid 1.1%, worsening from a 0.7% fall in March. It is the third-successive month construction production in the eurozone has fallen on-year. It had slumped 1.9% in February. The pound was quoted at $1.2737 at midday on Wednesday in London, up compared to $1.2693 at the equities close on Tuesday. The euro stood at $1.0749, up against $1.0736. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥157.85, down compared to JP¥157.97. In London, Spectris dropped 6.5%. It cautioned that its 2024 profit could fall marginally shy of consensus, as the supplier of high-tech instruments, test equipment and software noted weaker demand in China. In its Malvern Panalytical unit, the firm said the tepid China demand, a reduction in battery development, an easing of electric vehicle sales and ‘subdued’ trading in pharmaceuticals will hurt first-half sales and operating profit by £15 million and £10 million. Spectris noted that is in addition to £15 million and £10 million hits to sales and profit for the first-half due to the firm rolling out a new ERP system earlier this year. Spectris, however, noted that system hit will have no impact on its full-year outturn, as the lost earnings will be retrieved in the second half. Alpha Financial gained 23%. The specialist consultancy services to the financial services industry confirmed a non-binding takeover offer from Bridgepoint Advisers, valuing the business at 505 pence per share in cash. The board, it said, is minded to recommend the takeover offer to shareholders. Bridgepoint has a Thursday put-up-or-shut-up deadline. Last month, Alpha Financial confirmed that BridgePoint Advisers was considering a cash offer. At the time, it said that Cinven was also ‘considering a possible offer’, but had not yet submitted any indicative proposal. Miniature wargames maker, Games Workshop, rose 8.3%. For the financial year ended June 2, it expects to report core revenue of at least £490 million, a rise of 10% from £445.4 million. Pretax profit of at least £200 million is predicted, a rise of 17% from £170.6 million. On AIM, Arrow Exploration surged 16%. The oil exploration firm said it has put the first of four Ubaque horizontal wells planned for 2024 into production. The first horizontal well, it said, is ‘exceeding expectations’. Stocks in New York were seen mainly higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was called down 0.1%, but the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite were seen 0.1% and 0.2% higher respectively. Brent oil was quoted at $85.27 a barrel at midday in London on Wednesday, up from $85.02 late Tuesday. The black stuff continued to strengthen, after popping above the $84 per barrel mark on Tuesday, building on strong gains the previous day. According to analysts at Saxo Bank, oil prices were supported by funds rebuilding long positions, as a summer supply deficit emerged in Europe. This was despite recent data, which showed that Chinese refineries were operating at their slowest pace this year. In addition, an improving global energy demand outlook and expectations that major oil producers will keep supply tight buoyed oil prices, Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Guy Lawson-Johns said. Early this month, Opec+ decided to extend production cuts into the third quarter this year, in a bid to boost prices. ‘On the supply side, key Opec+ members such as Russia and Iraq reaffirmed their adherence to production quotas,’ Lawson-Johns said, adding that Saudi Arabia also indicated a willingness to adjust output in response to market conditions.

The FTSE 100 index closed up 13.82 points, 0.2%, at 8,205.11. The FTSE 250 ended down 28.88 points, 0.1%, at 20,381.05, and the AIM All-Share closed up 0.82 of a point, 0.1%, at 777.50. The Cboe UK 100 ended up 0.1% at 816.25, the Cboe UK 250 closed down 0.3% at 17,719.96, and the Cboe Small Companies ended up 0.6% at 16,729.11. In European equities on Wednesday, the CAC 40 in Paris ended down 0.8%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt ended down 0.4%. All eyes are on the Bank of England’s interest rate decision, which will be announced on Thursday at 1200 BST. It is widely expected by markets that the BoE will leave rates unchanged at a 16-year high of 5.25%, however inflation data on Wednesday has prompted hopes of an August interest rate cut. The UK CPI rate returned to the BoE’s target after nearly three years of loftier readings, numbers on Wednesday showed. According to the Office for National Statistics, the rate of yearly consumer price growth faded to 2.0% in May, from 2.3% in April. The reading was in-line with the FXStreet cited consensus. The rate of inflation stood as high as 11.1% in October 2022, but has faded, albeit in a bumpy fashion, since then. The rate of inflation last sat at the target range back in July 2021. The central bank’s next decision following Thursday’s is on August 1. Unlike June’s rate call, August’s decision will be accompanied by the latest monetary policy report with economic projections, as well as a press conference with Governor Andrew Bailey. Guy Foster, chief strategist at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said: ‘While headline inflation is now in line with the target, this inflation report does not support the idea of cutting interest rates. The good news is headline inflation has fallen back to the 2.0% target for the first time since July 2021. It is marginally above the BoE forecast but so marginally that this on its own doesn’t make it a hawkish print.’ The pound was quoted at $1.2723 at the London equities close Wednesday, higher compared to $1.2693 at the close on Tuesday. The euro stood at $1.0745 at the European equities close Wednesday, up against $1.0736 at the same time on Tuesday. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥157.92, lower compared to JP¥157.97 late Tuesday. In the FTSE 100, Berkeley lost 6.3%, making it the worst performer of the day. Berkeley raised its guidance for the current financial year but cautioned that UK planning restrictions could hinder growth thereafter. The Cobham, England-based housebuilder upped its pretax profit guidance for the current financial year ending April 2025 by 5% to £525 million. Its outlook for the following year was re-affirmed at £450 million. But looking further ahead to financial 2027 to 2029, Berkeley cautioned that until the planning and regulatory environments unlock, alongside an inflection in the sales market, pre-tax profitability is anticipated to remain around the level to be delivered in financial 2026. Other FTSE 100 housebuilders followed Berkeley lower. Barratt Developments, Persimmon, and Taylor Wimpey were down 2.7%, 2.8%, and 2.5%, respectively. In the FTSE 250, Games Workshop shot up 9.2%. The Nottingham, England-based miniature wargames maker and retailer said it anticipates annual pretax profit in the financial year ended June 2 to jump at least 17% to £200 million from £170.6 million a year prior. Core revenue is set to be at least 10% higher at £490 million compared to £445.4 million. On the other hand, Spectris shares tumbled 6.2%. The London-based supplier of high-tech instruments, test equipment and software for industrial applications warned full-year profit would be below expectations after a system overhaul took longer than expected and amid tough trading conditions at Malvern Panalytical. Amongst London’s small-caps, Speedy Hire jumped 7.5%. In the financial year that ended March 31, the Merseyside-based tools and equipment hire service company reported that pretax profit nearly tripled to £5.1 million from £1.8 million the year before. Revenue fell 4.3% to £421.5 million from £440.6 million, but cost of sales fell by even more, down 14% to £191.5 million from £221.6 million. Speedy Hire said the fall in revenue was in part due to a ‘softening’ in Regional customer markets. Brent oil was quoted at $85.77 a barrel at the London equities close Wednesday, up from $85.02 late Tuesday. Gold was quoted at $2,325.80 an ounce at the London equities close Wednesday, higher against $2,324.20 at the close on Tuesday.

The FTSE 100 index traded 8.57 points higher, 0.1%, at 8,281.03. The FTSE 250 was up 22.01 points, 0.1%, at 20,520.73, though the AIM All-Share added 1.85 points, 0.2%, at 774.23. The Cboe UK 100 rose 0.1% to 823.76, the Cboe UK 250 added 0.2% at 17,883.20, and the Cboe Small Companies was 0.1% higher at 16,822.03. In European equities on Friday, both the CAC 40 in Paris was flat and the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was down 0.2%. The pound was quoted at $1.2648 early Friday, down from $1.2675 late Thursday. The euro stood at $1.0696, falling from $1.0713. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥158.91, up from JP¥158.71. UK economic data was more robust on Friday. Retail sales increased at a faster pace than expected last month, numbers showed. According to the Office for National Statistics, UK retail sales volumes surged 2.9% in May from April, topping the FXStreet cited consensus of a 1.5% rise. Sales had declined 1.8% in April from March. April’s outcome was upwardly revised from an initially-reported 2.3% decline. On May’s reading, the ONS said: ‘Sales volumes rose across most sectors, with clothing retailers and furniture stores rebounding following poor weather in April. More broadly, sales volumes rose by 1.0% in the three months to May 2024 when compared with the previous three months. However, they fell by 0.2% when compared with the three months to May 2023.’ Year-on-year, retail sales rose 1.3% in May, defying expectations of a 0.9% decline, and improving markedly from a 2.3% slide in April. UK consumer confidence has seen its third monthly increase since March bolstered by increasing optimism about the economy, a survey suggests. GfK’s long-running consumer confidence index rose by three points in June as it made its slow climb out of negative territory to minus 14. The increase was driven by a seven-point improvement in confidence in the general economic situation during the last 12 months to minus 32, and a six-point rise in expectations for the economy over the coming year to minus 11. The data follows what was interpreted as a dovish hold by the Bank of England on Thursday. The left BoE the door ajar open for an August interest rate cut after saying June’s decision to leave bank rate unchanged was ‘finely balanced’. At its June meeting, the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-2 to keep bank rate at 5.25% for the seventh-successive meeting. The decision came after numbers on Wednesday showed that inflation returned to the BoE’s target for the first time since July 2021. According to the Office for National Statistics, the rate of yearly consumer price growth faded to 2.0% in May, from 2.3% in April. The reading was in-line with the FXStreet cited consensus. XTB analyst Kathleen Brooks noted that the brighter UK economic prospects have not led to a polling boost for the Conservative party, however, as the general election campaign rages on. ‘Interestingly, a boost to the economy and a strong consumer ahead of an election is usually good news for the incumbent party, especially with the prospect of a near-term interest rate cut is thrown in for good measure. Not so for the Tories, who remain in the doldrums polls wise and are expected to see a massive wipe out and a mass loss of seats at this election. The UK electorate are unwilling to ascribe the good economic data to the Conservatives, and this is also weighing on their chances in this election,’ Brooks added. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Tory figures who are found to have broken gambling rules ‘should face the full force of the law’, as he is likely to face further questions on the betting scandal engulfing his faltering election campaign. The prime minister said he was ‘incredibly angry to learn’ of the allegations that a string of people with links to the Conservative Party or Number 10 bet on the timing of the July 4 contest before he announced it. Concerns over political insiders profiting from the election date could overshadow his campaigning on Friday, when he is at the Welsh Conservative manifesto launch in Kinmel Bay. In London, shares in Britvic jumped 15% after the soft drinks maker, behind brands such as Robinsons squash and R White’s lemonade, said it rebuffed a takeover approach from brewer Carlsberg Group. Noting ‘press speculation’ Britvic said it received an unsolicited takeover proposal from Carlsberg earlier this month, at an offer price of 1,250 per share. That would give the FTSE 250 listing an equity value of £3.09 billion. It followed a proposal of 1,200p per share, which valued Britvic at £2.96 billion. ‘The board together with its advisers carefully considered the second proposal, and concluded that it significantly undervalues Britvic, and its current and future prospects,’ Britvic said. ‘The board remains confident in the current and future prospects of Britvic. It recognises its fiduciary duties and will consider any further proposal on its merits.’ The clock for Carlsberg is now ticking, and it has a ’put up or shut up’ deadline of the close of play on July 19. Carlsberg said: ‘Carlsberg believes that the proposal represents a compelling opportunity for Britvic shareholders to realise their investment in full in cash at an attractive valuation. Carlsberg believes that the potential transaction would enable it to capture appealing long-term growth opportunities from Britvic’s comprehensive portfolio of leading brands in an attractive segment of the beverage market where Carlsberg already has a strong track record.’ Among London’s large-caps, Informa rose 1.3%. The information publisher and events organiser hailed double-digit year-to-date revenue growth, and said it is on track to deliver 2024 results at the upper end of guidance. ‘The Informa group has changed gears and we are now delivering 10%+ growth,’ Chief Executive Stephen Carter said. Five-month group underlying revenue growth totalled just over 10%, ‘reflecting strong operational performances across all businesses’. It said revenue delivered to date amounts to £1.4 billion, and it noted a further £1 billion of Subscriptions / Exhibitor revenue is ‘committed and visible’ in 2024. In the B2B Markets offering, it said it is on track for high single digit underlying revenue growth in 2024. In Academic Markets, it believes it is set for over 5% growth. At group level, it expects high single digit underlying revenue growth and group revenue between £3.45 billion and £3.50 billion. United Utilities and Severn Trent rose 3.0% and 1.6%, the best FTSE 100 performers. JPMorgan lifted the water utilities to ’overweight’ and ’neutral’, respectively. Brent oil was quoted at $85.55 a barrel early Friday, largely unmoved from $85.57 late Thursday. Gold rose to $2,357.91 an ounce, flat from $2,357.90. In Asia on Friday, shares were largely lower.

While all the group’s key divisions achieved record results in 2023, management noted some second half softening in demand in the construction and hire fleet customer sectors which has continued into 2024. The company also highlighted a softening in used oil prices in the US and a change in accounting treatment of sale of franchise territories income, both of which are expected to impact profit in the current financial year to 31 December 2024. The final piece of news giving investors pause for thought was chief financial officer Mark Fryer stepping down to be replaced on an interim basis by Andrew Mallows. Shares in Franchise Brands are down 14% over the last year compared with a 9% gain in the FTSE-All Share index. A BUSY YEAR It was a busy year for Franchise Brands, which doubled in size following the £210.8 million takeover of hydraulic hose franchiser Pirtek in April 2023, a purchase financed by £100 million of debt and £114.3 million of new equity. The enlarged business delivered full year adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of £30.1 million, at the top end of market forecasts, and almost double the prior year’s £15.3 million. Adjusted   increased by 55% to £19.7 million as financial expenses jumped from £200,000 to £5.7 million, reflecting the increase in debt. An increase in share count following the equity raise reduced the increase in EPS (earnings per share) to 1% to 8.42p. The company ended the period with net debt of £74.7 million, equivalent to 2.48 times adjusted EBITDA. Franchise Brands remains very cash generative, and the business converted 100% of adjusted EBITDA into operating profit. DOUBLING THE BUSINESS AGAIN BY 2027 The company confirmed its medium-term strategic goals, as laid out at an investor day on 20 February, which include doubling system sales to £600 million and achieving a doubling of adjusted EBITDA to £60 million by 2027. The firm also anticipates getting back to a net cash position over the same timeframe. Executive Chairman Stephen Hemsley commented: ‘We see significant growth potential for our principal franchise brands of Pirtek, Metro Rod and Filta, which have small shares of large markets, as we extend their range of services, geographical penetration and cross-selling to our larger customer base. ‘This growth potential is supported by our Maximum Potential Model which we use to estimate the potential size of our markets.’ You can opt out at any time."},

Co-CEO, Stuart Burnett told  Shares  the company has helped customers throughout the cost-of-living crisis not only through competitive pricing but by giving households the opportunity of an additional income by recommending Utility Warehouse to their friends and family. Partner numbers increased by 14.1% to 68,251 for the year ending 31 March 2024 compared to 59,824 in 2023. Burnett said the company’s ‘unique multi-service model’ has helped to provide market-leading savings as families across the UK still face inflationary pressures and energy prices remain high. Adjusted pre-tax profit for the full year 2025 is expected to be between £124 million to £128 million with excess capital returned to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. EXPERT VIEW Research firm Megabuyte analyst Shekhan Ali notes: ‘The latest results from Telecom Plus flag more positive noises, with the business highlighting strength in a multi-utility offering not only in the face of a cost-of-living crisis but also in a tough regulatory backdrop for energy (capped pricing and profit per customer metrics), in particular, balancing margin constraints in energy with high margin services in mobile, broadband and cashback card. On the cash front, the operating outflow certainly isn’t a positive story with an outflow representing a massive drain on cash, but may be rationalised due to the timing of payments, although, more likely being the high cost of growth – with the dividend doing its job in taming investor sentiment as they reacted positively to the update.’ You can opt out at any time."},

The FTSE 100 index was up 32.94 points, or 0.4%, at 8,175.52. The FTSE 250 was 132.88 points, or 0.7%, at 20,292.77, and the AIM All-Share was up 2.01 points, or 0.3%, at 776.94. The Cboe UK 100 was up 0.4% at 814.27, the Cboe UK 250 was up 0.5% at 17,670.06, and the Cboe Small Companies was down 0.1% at 16,551.54. In European equities on Tuesday, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.4%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was up 0.3%. The pound was quoted at $1.2686 at midday on Tuesday in London, compared to $1.2685 at the equities close on Monday. The euro stood at $1.0718, against $1.0723. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥158.10 compared to JP¥15.84. Stocks in New York were seen predominantly higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was called marginally lower, while the S&P 500 index was seen just about in the green, and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.2%. Inflation readings will be the focus on Tuesday and Wednesday. This morning, figures from Eurostat showed that annual consumer price inflation in the eurozone accelerated to 2.6% in May, from 2.4% in April. The reading was in-line with an earlier estimate. Consumer prices increased 0.2% in May from April, also in line with the prior estimate. In April from March, prices rose by 0.6%. Core inflation, which strips out energy, food, alcohol & tobacco prices from the calculation, picked up to 2.9% in May, from 2.7% previously. The European Central Bank earlier this month cut interest rates by 25 basis points. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility, and the deposit facility now stand at 4.25%, 4.50% and 3.75%, respectively. However, subsequent comments from President Christine Lagarde dialled down expectations for further cuts. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the eve of the Bank of England decision, UK inflation data is released. According to consensus cited by Trading Economics, a return to the Bank of England’s 2% is expected, easing from a consumer price inflation rate of 2.3% in April. The BoE is expected to leave rates unmoved on Thursday. According to figures from Kantar, UK grocery price inflation eased to 2.1% in the four weeks to June 9, the lowest level since October 2021. This was lower than the 2.4% reported in the four weeks to May 12, which itself was down from 3.2% in April. In the same four week period, Kantar said grocery sales rose by 1.0%. For the 12 weeks to June 9, total grocery sales rose 2.4% to £33.98 billion from £33.18 billion a year prior. This was slightly below the 3.6% growth seen in the 12 weeks to May 12. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail & consumer insight at Kantar, said: ‘The sixth wettest spring on record hasn’t just dampened our spirits leading into summer, it’s made a mark on the grocery sector too as it seems Britons are being put off from popping to the shops. We’re not yet reaching for those typical summertime products and are making some purchases you wouldn’t expect in June.’ Still to come on Tuesday, there is a US retail sales reading at 1330 BST. In London, Ashtead Group fell 4.1%, the worst FTSE 100 performer, as its guidance disappointed. The equipment hire company reported an annual revenue hike and it lifted its payout, though profit declined on a higher interest expense amid lofty central bank rates. Revenue in the year ended April 30 improved 12% to $10.86 billion from $9.67 billion. Pretax profit, however, fell 2.1% to $2.11 billion from $2.16 billion. Interest expenses were 48% higher at $546.3 million, while operating costs rose 14% to $5.97 billion. Ashtead proposed a final dividend of 89.25 cents per share, up 5.0% from 85.0 cents. Its annual dividend totalled 105.0 cents, also rising 5.0% from 100.0 cents. Looking ahead, it said: ‘Our end markets in North America remain robust with healthy demand, supported in the US by the increasing number of mega projects and recent legislative acts. We are in a position of strength, with the operational flexibility and financial capacity to capitalise on the opportunities arising from these market conditions and ongoing structural changes.’ For the new year, it expects rental revenue growth of 5% to 8% at constant exchange rates, slowing from a 10% rise in the year just ended. Premier Inn owner Whitbread climbed 2.4%. It said its first-quarter sales nudged slightly higher, helped by ‘improved UK trading and continued progress in Germany’. Sales in the 13 weeks to May 30 rose 1% to £739 million. According to Chief Executive Dominic Paul ‘total accommodation sales and [revenue per available room] remained significantly ahead of pre-pandemic levels’, thanks to a favourable supply backdrop. Paul also noted a strong performance in Germany, ‘led by the increasing maturity of our estate and continued room growth. Our cohort of more established hotels is continuing to outperform the M&E market and we remain on course to achieve the important milestone of reaching break-even on a run-rate basis during the second half of 2024.’ Whitbread said recent trading in the UK has been ‘more encouraging’ and the firm is confident in its full-year outlook. Elsewhere in London, XP Power tumbled 15%. Suitor Advanced Energy Industries will not make a takeover offer for the power control systems maker. XP Power responded, noting it had no contact from Advanced Energy since rejecting an indicative proposal in mid-May, and reiterated its full-year trading expectations. Advanced Energy noted a ‘lack of any progress’ when it sought to engage with the XP Power board. This meant it did not have access to the ‘due diligence necessary to make a firm offer’. Advanced Energy Industries is a maker of precision power conversion, measurement, and control solutions. In May, it said it made three all-cash takeover approaches, each slightly higher than the last. The first offer in October valued XP Power’s equity at £339 million, a second roughly two weeks later in November valued it at £369 million and the most recent, in May, valued it at £468 million. Including debt, the latest proposal had a total value of £571 million. On AIM, Crossword Cybersecurity jumped 55%. It has signed a three-year, exclusive partnership with the UK unit of a ‘global aerospace, defence and security company’. The duo will jointly market supply chain cyber platform Rizikon to sub sectors in the UK critical national infrastructure market. ‘This is a potentially transformational partnership for Crossword with a global scale, innovative defence and security partner with an outstanding reputation,’ the firm’s incoming CEO Stuart Jubb said. Elsewhere, medical technology firm AOTI made its debut on the AIM market. The firm said it raised £35.1 million via its initial public offering. AOTI raised £19.5 million via placing 14.8 million newly issued shares at a placing price of 132 pence each, and £15.6 million via placing 11.8 million existing shares at the same price. Brent oil was quoted at $84.06 a barrel at midday in London on Tuesday, up from $83.45 late Monday. Gold was quoted at $2,309.80 an ounce against $2,321.50. Still to come on Tuesday’s economic calendar, there is a handful of data from the US, including industrial production at 1315 GMT, and a speech by the Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler at 1700 GMT.

Meanwhile, financial markets in New York are closed Wednesday for a public holiday. The FTSE 100 index traded 21.62 points lower, 0.3%, at 8,169.67. The FTSE 250 was down just 8.16 points at 20,401.77, and the AIM All-Share was down 0.06 of a point at 778.26. The Cboe UK 100 fell 0.3% at 813.18, the Cboe UK 250 was up 0.1% at 17,786.06, and the Cboe Small Companies was a touch higher at 16,629.70. In European equities on Wednesday, both the CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX 40 in Frankfurt were down 0.2%. The pound was quoted at $1.2729 early Wednesday, rising from $1.2693 at the time of the London equities close Tuesday. The euro stood at $1.0734, largely unmoved from $1.0736 late Tuesday. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥157.75, down from JP¥157.97. ‘UK inflation has finally dropped back to the Bank of England 2% target for the first time since July 2021, led by an easing in food inflation - a by-product of unseasonably poor weather in Britain in May,’ Ebury analyst Matthew Ryan commented. ‘We think that the clear signs of progress towards the BoE’s inflation target may be enough to elicit a dovish tweak in the MPC’s communications on Thursday. There will be no press conference this month, but the statement could hint that a first UK rate cut may be on the way in August. Investors will be paying particularly close attention to the vote on rates, as any additional dissenters in favour of an immediate cut would be an explicit signal that an August rate reduction is in the offing.’ Elsewhere, Wednesday’s economic calendar has eurozone construction output data at 1000 BST. On the UK election front, Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves will outline how Labour’s energy policies will aim to save £300 for families, while Prime Minister Rishi Sunak embarks on his ‘moral mission’ to cut taxes, as campaigning continues. Reeves will visit the South West and accuse the Conservatives of being ‘staggeringly out of touch with the struggles facing ordinary families’ in comments ahead of the release of May’s inflation data. She will reiterate Labour’s pledge to make Britain a clean energy superpower by 2030, which the party says will save families up to £300 per year off their energy bills, boost the UK’s energy independence, and create 650,000 good jobs. The party has pledged £8.3 billion for the publicly owned Great British Energy company, which will invest in clean energy. The Tories, meanwhile, reiterated their demand that Keir Starmer rule out a series of potential tax measures which they claim would be needed to fill a ‘£38.5 billion black hole’ in Labour’s plans. Sunak’s party republished a list of 17 tax hikes they say Labour could make, but the ppposition has said they would refuse to be drawn into the trap of responding to each claim. He said: ‘That’s the choice at this election – lower taxes with the Conservatives or a £2,094 tax hike under Labour that would hammer working families hardest.’ In Asia on Wednesday, shares were mixed. The Shanghai Composite ended down 0.4%, though the Hang Seng in Hong Kong shot up 2.9%, looking set to snap a three-day losing streak. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.2%, and over in Sydney, the S&P/ASX 200 closed 0.1% lower. The head of China’s central bank said on Wednesday that the economy still faced many challenges, but warned authorities would not resort to huge stimulus measures and instead exercise moderation. Central bank chief Pan Gongsheng told a financial forum in Shanghai that the economy was struggling with ‘insufficient effective demand, insufficiently smooth domestic circulation, and a marked rise in the complexity, severity and uncertainty of the external environment’. But he said authorities would ‘avoid major easing or tightening’. In London, Spectris dropped 7.8%. It cautioned that its 2024 profit could fall marginally shy of consensus, as the supplier of high-tech instruments, test equipment and software noted weaker demand in China. In its Malvern Panalytical unit, the firm said the tepid China demand, a reduction in battery development, an easing of electric vehicle sales and ‘subdued’ trading in pharmaceuticals will hurt first-half sales and operating profit by £15 million and £10 million. Spectris noted that is in addition to £15 million and £10 million hits to sales and profit for the first-half due to the firm rolling out a new ERP system earlier this year. Spectris, however, noted that system hit will have no impact on its full-year outturn, as the lost earnings will be retrieved in the second half. ‘As a result of our performance in the first half, and our revised expectations for the second half, we now expect adjusted operating profit to be at, or marginally below, the bottom end of the range of consensus analyst expectations for the full year,’ Spectris cautioned. Adjusted operating profit consensus stands at £232 million to £259 million, it noted. In addition, the firm noted Angela Noon will join as chief financial officer, with incumbent Derek Harding moving to the role of president of Spectris Scientific. The changes are with effect September 1. Noon is currently the CFO at Royal Mail and was formerly finance chief of Siemens UK & Ireland, Spectris noted. Miniature wargames maker Games Workshop rose 8.7%. For the financial year ended June 2, it expects to report core revenue of at least £490 million, a rise of 10% from £445.4 million. Pretax profit of at least £200 million is predicted, a rise of 17% from £170.6 million. On AIM, Arrow Exploration surged 22%. The oil exploration firm said it has put the first of four Ubaque horizontal wells planned for 2024 into production. ‘The first horizontal well on the Carrizales Norte ’B‘ pad (CNB HZ-1) is exceeding expectations,’ it hailed. In New York on Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%, the S&P 500 added 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite closed marginally higher.

On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia left its cash rate target unmoved, as it warned inflation ‘is proving persistent’. The RBA left the cash rate target unchanged at 4.35%, and the interest rate paid on exchange settlement balances unchanged at 4.25%, in a decision widely expected by the market. The central bank said: ‘Inflation has fallen substantially since its peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have been working to bring aggregate demand and supply closer towards balance. But the pace of decline has slowed in the most recent data, with inflation still some way above the midpoint of the 2–3% target range. Over the year to April, the monthly CPI indicator rose by 3.6% in headline terms, and by 4.1% excluding volatile items and holiday travel, which was similar to its pace in December 2023.’ Wider data is also showing ‘excess demand in the economy’, the RBA added. It warned that the path to return inflation to target is ‘unlikely to be smooth’. Still to come on Tuesday, there is a US retail sales reading at 1330 BST.

The shares dropped 180p or 3.3% to £53.30, undoing all their gains since mid-March and sending them to the bottom of the FTSE 100 performance table, as investors mulled over the results. EARNINGS SLIP The group, which has its headquarters in London but makes the majority of its sales and profits in North America, reported revenue up 7% for the three months to April and 12% for the full year driven by strong rental growth. In the US, rental-only revenue was up 12% during the year to $6.56 billion thanks to organic growth of 8% and bolt-on acquisitions which contributed 4% growth. Total revenue was up 13% to $9.3 billion due to a higher level of used equipment sales as the firm took advantage of a strong secondary market to accelerate some disposals scheduled for the current financial year. Across the group just over $900 million was spent on acquisitions, but an additional $4.3 billion was invested in existing locations and greenfield sites in order to drive sales. Higher interest rates and a higher debt pile meant pre-tax profit was down 10% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the year, while adjusted earnings per share were down 6% in the quarter and flat on an annual basis. OUTLOOK DISAPPOINTS Chief executive Brendan Horgan insisted the company’s North American end markets ‘remain robust with healthy demand, supported in the US by the increasing proportion of mega projects and the ongoing impact of the legislative acts’ and said the firm was in ‘a position of strength’ going forward. However, for the year to next April Ashtead is only   group rental revenue growth of between 5% and 8%, with the core US business seen increasing rental income by between 4% and 7%, down sharply on last year. With the UK seen growing by just 3% to 6%, the onus is on the Canadian business to grow by between 15% and 19% to hit the firm’s overall target, which from the outside seems like a tall order. Moreover, there was no mention in the statement of the company moving its main listing from London to New York which will have disappointed some investors. You can opt out at any time."},

Advanced Energy   this morning confirming that it has walked away, saying that it believed a £19.50 per share offer ‘captured the potential of future market recovery while factoring in near and intermediate term market and operational risks facing XP Power as a standalone company.’ WHAT’S BEEN GOING ON? Singapore-based XP Power has   multiple offers made by precision power kit peer Advanced Energy over past months, having first placed a £17 per share deal on the table more than six months ago. The most recent pitch in May 2024, at £19.50 per share, valued the UK-listed business at £468 million. XP Power’s board refused to even discuss a takeover at what they believed was a valuation far below the underlying worth of the company.

ANALYSTS SEE HUGE RECOVERY POTENTIAL Analysts at broker Davy believe XP Power will be proved right in the end. ‘We continue to believe that significant shareholder value can be created from a standalone XPP’, they wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. ‘Historic operational leverage into recovering volumes is high, and we continue to expect a recovery in all end markets in 2025.’ Davy analysts have slapped a target price on the shares at £25.30, almost double the current £12.78 and 30% above Alternative Energy last offer. XP Power stock has traded as high as £56 in the past (2021). The company has been struggling for several months after demand for its critical power control components dipped significantly.

The shares are down 17% since the beginning of the year compared with a 6% gain for the benchmark FTSE 100 index. AN IMPROVING TREND Group sales grew 1% to £739 million driven by an improved performance in the UK and continued progress in Germany. In the UK, following a soft first seven weeks which saw like-for-like sales down 1%, revenue per available room 1.6% lower and food and beverage sales down 1% lower,   over the full 13 weeks ended flat year-on-year. Shore Capital’s leisure analyst Greg Johnson estimates this implies like-for-like sales improved to flat to moderately positive towards the back end of the quarter. ‘With forward bookings remaining positive, we would anticipate trading strengthening heading into peak summer season’, said Johnson. ‘We estimate that Whitbread requires circa 2% LFL UK revenue growth for the balance of the year to meet our full-year assumptions. Supporting this, net cost inflation is now expected to be at the lower end of the 3% to 4% guidance range.’ Premier Inn Germany reported accommodation sales up 15%, led by the increasing maturity of the estate and site expansion and the company said it remained on track to break even during the second half of 2024.

Chief executive Dominic Paul commented: ‘Whilst the normal booking pattern means our forward visibility remains limited, our forward booked position is positive and we remain confident in the full-year outlook. ‘With significant potential in both the UK and Germany, supported by the structural reduction in supply and our asset-backed balance sheet, our strategic plans are set to deliver a step change in our performance.’ The company continues to execute its £150 million share buyback programme with 3.2 million shares purchased so far for a consideration of £96 million. EXPERT VIEWS  Shore's Johnson maintained his 2025 financial year pre-tax profit estimate of £525 million and said he was encouraged by the improving trend in revenue per available room versus his UK full year assumptions. ‘With cost inflation now set to be at the lower end of guidance, our estimates can likely be achieved on circa 1% LFL growth, or 2% for the balance of the year’, he concluded. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould commented: ‘The latest update implies Whitbread is wading through mud in the UK with like-for-like sales for accommodation and food and drink both in decline. ‘Given the circumstances, Whitbread might view this performance as resilient as the rate of UK sales decline is only marginal. However, it does put more pressure on the business to have a bumper summer if it wants the first-half results to shine.

The shares slumped 450p or 14% at the open to a 12-month low of £27.50 before recovering to £29.50 for a loss of 8% in mid-morning trade. PANALYTICAL PAINS The main reason the firm gave for lowering guidance was revenue issues at the spectrometry business Malvern Panalytical. The roll-out of a new ERP (enterprise resource planning) system across Malvern meant operations were disrupted, which is normal, but in this case the upheaval has lasted longer than expected. As a result, around £15 million of sales and £10 million of operating profit which should have booked in the first half, which ends this month, are now expected to be booked in the second half, although there is no impact on the full year. Additionally, however, Malvern has seen weaker demand in China, a ‘significant’ reduction in battery development due to the slowdown in EV (electric vehicle) sales and ‘subdued’ trading in pharmaceuticals. All of which is set to reduce first-half sales by a further £15 million and operating profit by a further £10 million, meaning full-year operating profit will be at or marginally below the bottom end of analysts’ forecasts of £232 million to £259 million. The firm   trading across its other businesses was in line with expectations, although that did little to help the share price. EXPERT VIEW Although the consensus view on Spectris is mildly positive, not all analysts are fans of the company, with many having a Sell recommendation, which is unusual. Tom Fraine and Akhil Patel at Shore Capital have had a Sell recommendation on the shares since the end of February following confirmation of a weak order book, which in their view called into question management’s ‘through-the-cycle’ organic sales growth target. Based on today’s update, the pair expect first-half operating profit to be within a range of £60 million to £64 million compared with market forecasts of £80 million to £84 million, while full-year profit is likely to be downgraded to around £230 million, a touch below the low end of the current range of estimates.

The FTSE 100 builder also flagged signs that the housing market outlook is improving with inflation greatly reduced and a first interest rate cut from the Bank of England expected later this year. However, shares in the brownfield regeneration specialist cheapened 3.5% to £48.40 as some investors booked profits following a recent strong run and others focused on the modest drop in margins and profit reported for the year to April 2024. Also weighing on sentiment was the cautious medium term outlook from Berkeley, which warned pre-tax profitability could be anchored around the level expected for full year 2026 until ‘the planning and regulatory environments unlock’. SOLID FOUNDATIONS The London-focused housebuilder’s results for the year to 30 April 2024 revealed a 7.7% drop in pre-tax profit to £557.3 million, better than the £550 million called for by consensus.  also increased its net cash position by £122 million year-on-year to over £500 million. Careful cash stewardship enabled the company to continue rewarding shareholders with returns of capital. While sales reservations were down around a third last year, reflecting higher interest rates and weak economic sentiment, Berkeley said pricing and margins have remained firm and build cost inflation is at ‘negligible levels’. As a result, the builder confidently increased its full year 2025 pre-tax profit guidance by 5% to £525 million and reaffirmed its full year 2026 target of £450 million. CEO Rob Perrins commented: ‘We continue to see good levels of enquiry for well-located homes built to a high standard of design and quality but recognise that the current lack of urgency in the market is likely to remain until the long-anticipated reduction in interest rates commences.’ Perrins added: ‘Berkeley continues to benefit from a strong order book and has already secured 80% of its sales for next year, underpinning today’s 5% increase in guidance for full year 2025’s pre-tax profit to £525 million, with guidance for full year 2026 re-affirmed at £450 million.’ BERKELEY BRANCHES OUT And in a significant development, the brownfield regeneration specialist also announced plans to establish its own Build to Rent platform. Berkeley aims to develop 4,000 homes over the next ten years in order to capitalise on high rental demand in the capital. It will fund this from a mixture of internal funds, bank debt and eventually external funding. Wealth Club’s Charlie Huggins said the news ‘seems like a shrewd move, giving Berkeley greater capital deployment options. However, it could also be a sign that Berkeley believes tough housing market conditions are here to stay.’ Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said it will take time for Berkeley to build up this side of the business, but it ‘could eventually provide a useful source of diversification given the rental space tends to be steadier than the wider property market. Berkeley’s moves tend to be widely followed in the industry, thanks to its late founder Tony Pidgley’s reputation as a shrewd operator.’ DISCLAIMER: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in this article owns Shares magazine.

The shares, which have been in a holding pattern this year, trading between £90 and £100, jumped 8% to £101.80, as investors anticipated earnings upgrades from analysts. Consensus EPS (earnings per share) estimates have been revised upwards by around 3% over the last year. WHAT DID THE COMPANY SAY? Core   for the year to 2 June, which excludes burgeoning licensing sales, is expected to be at least £490 million, with licensing income expected to be £30 million, an increase of 10% and 20% respectively. Consensus estimates were calling for total revenue of £494 million, equating to a 5% beat. That said, the company has often cautioned that licensing revenue is ‘lumpy’ which is why it is reported separately to core revenue. Chief executive Kevin Rountree has said he believes Games Workshop has some of the best unexploited IP (intellectual property) globally. A big step-up in realising that ambition was the tie-up with  Amazon (AMZN:NASDAQ)  to develop the  Warhammer 40,000  universe into films and TV series in December 2022. Jefferies estimates it could eventually earn Games Workshop $1 million per TV episode, although it could be up to three years before a series hits the screens. Moving to the profit line, the company said it expects full year group pre-tax profit of at least £200 million, up 17% on the £171 million reported in 2023 and 5% ahead of analysts’ estimates. EXPERT VIEWS Investment director at AJ Bell, Dan Coatsworth, commented: ‘There is no insight into trading, no comment on new developments, and no guidance for future earnings.’ Under normal circumstances, shareholders would be livid about such treatment, he said. But anyone invested in Games Workshop seems to be used the bluntness of its announcements and takes the view that no news is good news when it comes to details on the business. ‘The numbers spoke for themselves, with profit expected to beat market expectations. Licensing income is really picking up, which is important to Games Workshop’s strategy of trying to sweat its assets and find more ways to commercially exploit its intellectual property.’ Jefferies said the full year out turn represents a ‘robust end to the year resulting in another small upgrade to consensus, even if this was mostly driven by the lumpy Licensing income line’.

The FTSE 100 index closed down 4.71 points, 0.1%, at 8,142.15. The FTSE 250 ended up 39.36 points, 0.2%, at 20,159.72, and the AIM All-Share closed up 1.11 points, 0.2%, at 774.93. The Cboe UK 100 ended down slightly at 810.95, the Cboe UK 250 closed up 0.4% at 17,583.99, and the Cboe Small Companies ended up 0.7% at 16,561.66. In European equities on Monday, the CAC 40 in Paris ended up 0.9%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt ended up 0.4%. So far this week, the UK has had house price data to digest. The reading showed that UK house prices snapped at the heels of May’s record high this month, despite robust mortgage rates and the threat of election uncertainty. Rightmove said the average UK house asking price was largely flat on-month at £375,110 in June, compared to May’s record high of £375,131. On-year, house prices grew 0.6% in June, the same pace of growth in May. Rightmove analyst Tim Bannister commented: ‘It’s always difficult to predict how home-movers will react to sudden uncertainty, but looking back through our data, we can see that during previous election campaigns, market activity has remained largely steady. ‘This election has followed a similar pattern so far, and the responses from our poll of over 14,000 people also supports the data, with the vast majority of respondents saying they will carry on with their home-moving plans.’ It is a big week in terms of monetary policy decisions and economic data for the UK, especially ahead of the general election. However, AJ Bell’s Russ Mould said the latest Bank of England meeting and reading of inflation mid-week will have ‘a greater influence.’ ‘The focus will be on the commentary which accompanies another anticipated hold on rates and there will be hopes that the rate of growth in prices might retreat to the magic 2% to warrant rate cuts soon,” Mould added. On Wednesday, UK consumer and producer price data is out. The BoE interest rate decision will be announced the day after. In France, markets rebounded somewhat on Monday, following a rocky period last week. French stocks fell last week, amid President Emmanuel Macron’s snap election gamble. The pound was quoted at $1.2685 at the London equities close Monday, up slightly compared to $1.2683 at the close on Friday. The euro stood at $1.0723 at the European equities close Monday, higher against $1.0698 at the same time on Friday. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥15.84, up compared to JP¥157.36 late Friday. In London, the FTSE 100’s Kingfisher lost 1.1%. In the FTSE 250, British Land edged up 0.3%. Kingfisher has hired the chief financial officer of British Land to be its own CFO, the two companies said. Kingfisher operates do-it-yourself home improvement stores in the UK and France under the Screwfix, B&Q, Castorama, Brico Depot brands. British Land is a commercial property developer. Both are based in London. Kingfisher said it has hired Bhavesh Mistry as its new CFO. He will succeed Bernard Bot, whose leaving date is yet to be confirmed but will be ’no earlier‘ than January 2025. British Land said Mistry will stay in his current role until a replacement is found, noting that he has a 12-month notice period. On AIM, Mind Gym lost 12%. In the 12 months that ended March 31, the London-based personal and business coaching service reported a pretax loss of £12.1 million, swinging from a £3.0 million profit the year prior, as revenue fell 18% to £44.9 million from £55.0 million. Macroeconomic headwinds affected confidence in key sectors including tech, especially in the US, and consumer and manufacturing companies dependent on global supply chains, Mind Gym said. Stocks in New York were higher at the London equities close, with the DJIA up 0.1%, the S&P 500 index up 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.3%.

In European equities on Tuesday, the CAC 40 in Paris ended up 0.8%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt ended up 0.3%. Eyes are on UK economic data, as well as latest monetary policy decisions. This is especially important in the wake of the UK election. UK inflation data is due out at 0700 BST on Wednesday. According to FXStreet, CPI is expected to cool to 2%, the BoE’s target, in May from 2.3% a month earlier. The data comes ahead of the latest interest rate decision from the Bank of England. Markets are expecting the central bank to leave rates unchanged. This morning, figures from Eurostat showed that annual consumer price inflation in the eurozone accelerated to 2.6% in May, from 2.4% in April. The reading was in-line with an earlier estimate. Consumer prices increased 0.2% in May from April, also in line with the prior estimate. In April from March, prices rose by 0.6%. Core inflation, which strips out energy, food, alcohol & tobacco prices from the calculation, picked up to 2.9% in May, from 2.7% previously. Stocks in New York were mixed at the London equities close, with the DJIA down 0.1% and Nasdaq Composite lost 0.2%, whilst the S&P 500 index up 0.1%. US retail sales edged up by less than anticipated, US Census Bureau data showed. US advance monthly sales for retail and food services grew by just 0.1% monthly to $703.1 billion in May, from $702.5 billion in April, the latter which was downwardly revised from $705.2 billion reported a month ago. May’s growth was slower than the 0.2% climb expected by the FXStreet-cited consensus. Notably, retail & food services sales excluding motor vehicles & parts contracted by 0.1% in May, counter to FXStreet-cited expectations which had pencilled in growth of 0.2%.

Hargreaves Lansdown confirmed it received a revised takeover proposal, and extended the deadline for an interested consortium to announce its intention to make an offer. The Bristol, England-based wealth management platform confirmed it has decided to engage with the consortium, led by CVC Capital Partners, about a revised offer that would incorporate a final dividend worth more than 30 pence per share. That figure is 25% below a 40p figure reported earlier on Tuesday by Sky News. The proposed offer prices the company at 1,140 pence per share, which is 8.6% higher than Sky’s earlier reported figure of around 1,050p. Ashtead Group fell 2.0%. In the financial year that ended April 30, the London-based provider of equipment hire said pretax profit fell 2.1% to $2.11 billion from $2.16 billion. This came despite a 12% increase in revenue to $10.86 billion from $9.67 billion. Ashtead proposed a final dividend of 89.25 US cents per share, up 5.0% from 85.0 cents. Its annual dividend totalled 105.0 cents, also rising 5.0% from 100.0 cents. Amongst London’s small caps, XP Power, the maker of power control systems, lost 14%. XP Power said that Advanced Energy Industries does not intend to make an offer. AEI said it had sought to engage with the XP Power board of directors, but the lack of any progress has prevented it from accessing the due diligence materials necessary to make a firm offer. On AIM, Crossword Cybersecurity jumped 40%.

The FTSE 100 index opened up 2.07 points at 8,165.74. The FTSE 250 was up 7.97 points at 20,203.92, and the AIM All-Share was up 0.63 of a point, 0.1%, at 781.06.

In European equities on Friday, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 1.0%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was down 0.2%. In political news, Reform UK has overtaken the Conservatives in a major opinion poll, as UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak continues his absence from the general election campaign trail to meet world leaders in Italy. A YouGov survey commissioned by the Times newspaper had Nigel Farage’s party at 19% to the Conservatives 18% in voting intention, in a crossover moment which is the latest blow to Tory hopes of returning to government. Markets in France continued to take a hit, too, as its own election picked up. Away from the Europe, the Bank of Japan on Friday said it would trim its vast hoard of government bonds as it cautiously steps away from its long-running ultra-loose monetary policy. The central bank kept interest rates unchanged after a two-day meeting but announced plans to ‘reduce its purchase amount of JGBs (Japanese Government Bonds) thereafter to ensure that long-term interest rates would be formed more freely’. ‘A detailed plan’ for the reduction ‘during the next one to two years or so’ will be decided at the next policy meeting in July, it said. ‘The question for investors is why did they wait a month and not start tapering today, is there that much difference? The answer is most likely an abundance of caution at the BOJ. The cautious stance is clear when it comes to bond buying, however, the BOJ was also expected to hike interest rates at its meeting in July. We doubt that the BOJ will hike rates and embark on QT in the same month,’ said Kathleen Brooks at XTB. In the aftermath, the yen fell, but the Nikkei rose. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥158.03 early Friday, up compared to JP¥156.88 at the equities close on Thursday. The Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo was up 0.2%. The pound was quoted at $1.2728 early on Friday in London, lower compared to $1.2764 at the equities close on Thursday. The euro stood at $1.0718, down against $1.0763. In the FTSE 100, Tesco edged up 0.3%. The grocer said like-for-like sales in the 13 weeks to May 25, the financial first quarter, rose 3.4% to £15.31 billion. The UK outperformed with comparable sales up 4.6% to £11.4 billion. Booker sales fell 1.3%, Central Europe sales rose 0.6% while in the Republic of Ireland sales climbed 4.4%. Charlie Huggins at Wealth Club said: ‘This is another solid trading update from Tesco with further volume growth and market share gains in the first quarter. The group is more than holding its own against the German discounters and carries good momentum into the upcoming summer of sport.’ In the FTSE 250, Crest Nicholson rose 9.9%, whilst Bellway fell 2.9%. On Thursday, Bellway made a new takeover proposal for Crest, but said it had been rejected. Bellway said under the terms of the bid, Crest Nicholson investors would have stood to receive 0.093 of a Bellway share for each Crest Nicholson share. It valued Crest Nicholson shares at 253.00 pence each, the company’s equity overall at around £650.0 million. On Friday, Crest confirmed that it has rejected the offer, as it undervalues the company. ‘Crest Nicholson remains confident in its standalone prospects, in particular given conclusion of the review of provisions for completed development sites supported by external consultants, its highly attractive land portfolio and the new leadership of Martyn Clark,’ Crest said. Elsewhere in London, Raspberry Pi shares jumped 15%, hitting 471.90 pence. The early high represents a more than 70% premium on the firm’s initial public offering price earlier this week. The shares had already surged 47% in the three days since hitting the market on Tuesday, but until this morning trading the stock was conditional, meaning that it was only available to institutional shareholders.

The London-headquartered staff training play lurched from pre-tax profits of £3 million to a £12.1 million statutory pre-tax loss after write-downs and restructuring costs. However, cost efficiency initiatives drove an encouraging return to second half adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) profitability. And with a new CEO at the helm, Mind Gym is focusing on a growth strategy to enhance ease of purchase, delivery, and renewal of its solutions. US SALES DECLINE  pinned the drop in sales and lurch into the red on macroeconomic headwinds which affected confidence in key sectors including technology, especially in the US, as well as the consumer and manufacturing sectors where companies are dependent on global supply chains. Revenues in the EMEA region remained flat last year, while US sales saw a  significant decline with performance ‘particularly adversely impacted by a material decline in client spend on DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion).’ The company, which uses behavioural science to build training programmes, also bemoaned the increased caution on HR budgets which has affected the buying cycle, ‘with more client stakeholders needed to sign off budgets’. EASY TO BUY, SELL, RENEW Alongside the results Christoffer Ellehuus, who succeeded Octavius Black as CEO in April, set out his new strategy for growth and profitability. ‘I believe that we have all the right foundations for future growth: strong client relationships, innovative solutions, and a very talented team,’ said Ellehuus. ‘I am excited about leading Mind Gym forward on a path of profitable, sustainable growth, profitability making Mind Gym solutions easy to buy, easy to deliver, and easy to renew.’ Despite prevailing macroeconomic headwinds, Mind Gym expects to be profitable at the EBITDA level, generate cash in the year to March 2025 and in the medium term, is confident of delivering a compound annual growth rate in revenue north of 10% with EBITDA margins of between 15% and 20%. The company also insists the opportunity in a ‘highly fragmented $80 billion human capital advisory market remains ‘as compelling as ever’, although the market appears unconvinced with the shares trading 80% below their June 2018 initial public offering issue price of 146p. BUT LIBERUM REMAINS BULLISH Liberum Capital has a ‘buy’ rating on Mind Gym and a 45p price target. The broker said the key highlight is ‘the new CEO laying out an updated strategy, focused at making Mind Gym’s solutions easier to Buy, Sell and Renew. An evolution of the customer value proposition through integration and productisation, as well as changes to the go-to-market (channel partners, digital marketing, lead generation etc) we see improving earnings visibility and deepening customer relationships.’ You can opt out at any time."},

The approval was based on results from a late-stage trial which showed  Imfinzi  plus  carboplatin  and  paclitaxel  followed by  Imfinzi  monotherapy reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 58% versus chemotherapy alone. Endometrial   is the fourth most prevalent in US women, with more than 66,000 cases diagnosed in 2022 leading to almost 22,000 deaths according to the WHO (World Health Organisation). WHAT DID THE COMPANY SAY? AstraZeneca’s executive vice president of oncology David Frederiksen said: ‘There have been limited advances in the treatment of endometrial cancer in the last few decades, and continued innovation is critical as the burden of this cancer is expected to grow in the future. ‘Immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy is emerging as a new standard of care in this setting, and the approval of  Imfinzi  offers an important new option for patients with mismatch repair deficient disease.’ Imfinzi  is a human monoclonal antibody that bonds to specific proteins, countering the tumour’s immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses. The treatment is approved in several countries in combination with chemotherapy in locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract (digestive system) cancer and in combination with  Imjudo  in unremovable liver cancer. Imfinzi  generated sales of $4.2 billion in 2023, up 52% on the prior year, making it is one of AstraZeneca’s blockbuster treatments. It was first approved in May 2017 and more than 220,000 patients have been treated with the drug. AstraZeneca shares, which fell 0.5% to £124.5 despite the news, are up 15% since the start of the year compared with a 5% gain for the blue-chip FTSE 100 index. You can opt out at any time."},

Fed chair Jerome Powell welcomed the latest inflation data but remained hawkish in his view that rates would remain on hold until Fed committee members gained more confidence in the sustainability of the downward trend in inflation. The Fed’s new summary of economic projections saw a slight uptick in core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) by the end of 2024 as base effects kick-in while the median number of rate cuts fell to one cut amidst a wide dispersion of views among committee members with four projecting no cuts at all. Bond yields fell across the board with the 10-year treasury yield dropping from 4.45% to 4.27%, one of the biggest moves since December 2023 as investors priced in lower inflation.  Inflation expectations implied by yields on inflation-linked bonds declined to 2.2%, the lowest since the start of the year. Technology stocks were prominent among the S&P 500 leaders buoyed by excitement over AI (artificial intelligence) deals.  Broadcom (AVGO:NASDAQ)  led the pack, hitting a record high boosted by demand for AI-linked chips. At the other end of the spectrum  Paramount Global (PARA:NASDAQ)  fell 13% on disappointment a deal with Skydance media is not moving forward as hoped. BROADCOM Could  Broadcom (AVGO:NASDAQ)  be the next member of the exclusive trillion-dollar club? Yes, say analysts at Bank of America, in response to estimate-beating earnings and the chip firm’s 10-for-1 stock split plan. Investors cheered the semiconductor manufacturer and the share price soared, rallying 12% on Thursday (13 Jun) for a near-20% surge during the past week, to close at an all-time high of $1,678.99 for a market cap of $776 billion. Bank of America thinks Broadcom has even greater potential even after its big quarterly report.  In a note, its analysts upgraded the firm’s price target to $2,000, indicating about 18% upside from current levels, calling the firm a ‘a top AI (artificial intelligence) pick’ that appears ‘uniquely positioned to grow’ in areas such as custom AI chips, ethernet networking, and  VMware (VMW:NASDAQ)  upsell capacity. Broadcom is one of a growing number of semiconductor manufacturers that have been buoyed by the AI frenzy, as their chips are used to power the underlying software. $3.1 billion in sales during fiscal second quarter (to end Apr) were tied to AI products, the company said. Strong sales ahead also helped Broadcom surge on Thursday, as it forecast $51 billion revenues this year, slightly above consensus. These are factors not missed by  Shares , which flagged Broadcom in our cover feature on quality stocks this week. ORACLE On 11 June  Oracle (ORCL:NASDAQ)  was able to shrug off weaker than expected quarterly results as it announced it had struck two new AI partnerships that will leverage the data giant’s AI infrastructure, one with ChatGPT developer Open AI and its backer  Microsoft (MSFT:NASDAQ) , the other with  Alphabet’s (GOOG:NASDAQ)  Google Cloud.Teaming up with Microsoft and OpenAl will help extend the former’s Azure Al platform and provide extra capacity for OpenAl.  It is a similar deal with Google Cloud, where the pair will integrate their powerful cloud computing capabilities inside Google Cloud, including the building of a dozen new datacentres. ‘We expect the Oracle database to be available within the Google Cloud in September this year,’ Oracle said. While the numbers did come in short of forecasts, this was only a modest miss, Q4 adjusted EPS (earnings per share) coming in at $1.63 on revenue of $14.3 billion, versus Wall Street consensus pitched at $1.65 on revenue of $14.6 billion. Remaining performance obligations, a gauge of booked revenue, climbed 44% to $98 billion, which would have helped lift the mood, with Oracle recognising more cloud revenue than licence support for the second consecutive quarter, according to Megabuyte’s Jack Wilson-Fowler. GENERAL MOTORS General Motors’ (GM:NYSE)  shares sped 5% higher to $47.7 this week, taking year-to-date gains to 30%-plus, despite an EV (electric vehicle) forecast production cut from the Detroit-headquartered car maker.  Investors welcomed a fresh $6 billion share buyback plan (11 June) from the Mary Barra-bossed company, which is counting on robust demand for its gas-guzzling models at a time of uncertainty over the adoption of all-electric vehicles.  General Motors, whose iconic brands include Chevrolet, GMC, Cadillac and Buick, now sees the higher end of its 2024 EV production will be 250,000 units, a downgrade from management’s earlier 300,000 unit forecast.  ‘We are very focused on the profitability of our ICE (internal combustion engine) business, we’re growing and improving the profitability of our EV business and deploying our capital efficiently,’ explained chief financial officer Paul Jacobson. ‘This allows us to continue returning cash to shareholders.’  Back in November, General Motors announced a $10 billion share buyback after reaching a new labour agreement with the combative United Auto Workers union.

The FTSE 100 index traded down 7.60 points, 0.1%, at 8,139.26. The FTSE 250 edged up just 1.22 points to 20,121.58, and the AIM All-Share lost 0.54 of a point, 0.1%, at 775.50. The Cboe UK 100 was down 0.2% at 810.01, the Cboe UK 250 was up 0.1% at 17,517.86, and the Cboe Small Companies was marginally lower at 16,449.01. In European equities on Monday, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.2%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was marginally higher. Both suffered heftier declines than the FTSE 100 last week, however. The CAC slumped 6.2% and the DAX lost 3.0%. London’s blue-chip benchmark declined 1.2%. Political turmoil in France hit Parisian equities last week, and Paris lost its spot as Europe’s biggest equity market to London, less than two years after winning that crown, Bloomberg reported on Monday. President Emmanuel Macron’s shock announcement of a snap election sparked a rout that wiped off about $258 billion from the market capitalisation of French firms last week. XTB analyst Kathleen Brooks commented: ‘French stocks sold off led by French banks, which caused French bond yields to rise even more as traders added a bailout premium to French sovereign debt, this caused credit default swaps on investment grade European corporate entities, as measured by the Itraxx index, to rise to its highest level for 7 months. ‘The question is, what happens now? If French stocks sell off at the same pace this week as they did last week, then there is a real risk that French banks will need a bailout. We doubt that this will happen. While political uncertainty is still likely to weigh on French asset prices until the final round of voting on July 7th, there have been some developments over the weekend that could ease some market fears at the start of this week. The leader of France’s far right party, Marine Le Pen, who is expected to win the most seats in the upcoming French parliamentary elections, has said that she will work with centrist President Macron and will not try to push him out of office if her party wins the election.’ The pound was quoted at $1.2666 early on Monday afternoon in London, down from $1.2683 at the time of the European equities close Friday. The euro rose to $1.0708 from $1.0698, while against the yen, the dollar rose to JP¥157.62 from JP¥157.36. The Bank of England announces an interest rate decision on Thursday, following a UK inflation reading for May on Wednesday. Analysts at Lloyds Bank commented: ‘If the April CPI numbers didn’t completely kill off expectations of a June rate cut then subsequent news that the vote would be during an election campaign pretty much did, with markets ascribing less than a 5% probability to a 25bp cut on Thursday. It’s hard to see the language evolving much in the MPC minutes. That is partly due to the political backdrop, but mostly because what were the ’forthcoming data releases’ emphasised last time haven’t really worked in the direction of further laying the ground for an imminent rate cut ‘If economic forecasters have got it right, then it is too much for market participant to hope for that May CPI will ease enough to make up for last month’s overshoot versus BoE staff projections. Lloyds economists expect headline CPI inflation to fall to 2.0% year-on-year, so good news compared to 2.3% year-on-year last time, but still above the 1.9% year-on-year the BoE has pencilled in for this time.’ In London, miners struggled on the back of mixed China data. China is a major buyer of minerals. Rio Tinto fell 1.7%, Glencore gave back 1.5% and Anglo American lost 1.0%. Chinese retail sales picked up in May but industrial production growth slowed, official data showed Monday, suggesting the recovery in the world’s second-largest economy remains uneven. Leaders have struggled to kickstart growth since an initial burst followed the end in late 2022 of stringent Covid measures that had hammered businesses and consumer activity, while a property crisis and high unemployment has dented investor confidence. In May, retail sales – a key measure of consumer spending – grew 3.7% year-on-year, rebounding from April’s 2.3% increase, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The figure was also higher than the 3.0% increase predicted in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. However, industrial production growth slowed, with May’s 5.6% expansion well down from 6.7% in April and short of the 6.2% forecast in the Bloomberg survey. Capital Economics analyst Louise Loo commented: ‘Unconvincing onshore activity momentum outside of the ’new’ industries in May suggests that the recent step-up in property and fiscal stimulus has not (yet) improved consumer and investor sentiment. Retail sales growth was an upside surprise, but that was likely partly a result of frontloaded spending and favourable base effects.’ Back in London, SSP fell 2.7%. Goldman Sachs cut the operator of food kiosks in travel locations to ’sell’ from ’neutral’. Greencore fell 1.2%, as the on-the-go food maker looks set to extend its losing streak to seven days. Greencore is among the manufacturers that have recalled a variety of sandwiches, wraps and salads sold in major UK supermarkets because of a potential link to an E.coli outbreak that left people across the UK in hospital, PA reported. Shares in Contango Holdings jumped after the company announced a new investor has bought a majority stake in its Muchesu coal project in Zimbabwe. Contango said the investor, Wencai Huo, is ‘a prominent Zimbabwe-based Chinese national with extensive mining and business investments in Zimbabwe and the southern African region’. Huo will buy a 51% stake in the Muchesu mine. Contango currently holds a 70% interest via its Monaf Investments (Pvt) Ltd subsidiary. This is interest is expected to rise to 74.75% in the near term, so Huo’s acquisition will leave Contango with a 23.75% stake. Huo will make a cash investment in Contango at the recent average market price to take a 20% stake. The investor also will spend at least $20 million to develop Muchesu, matching what Contango has already invested in the project. Contango shares traded 25% higher. Brent oil was quoted at $82.51 a barrel early Monday afternoon, flat from late Friday. Gold was quoted at $2,319.64 an ounce, down from $2,327.27.

This trading freedom saw the stock enjoy another pop, jumping a further 14.3% to 471p versus a top-of-the-range listing price of 280p. Investors lucky enough to get in at the start have already enjoyed juicy returns. Bumper demand for shares in the Cambridge-based business meant some retail investors didn’t get everything they wanted in the IPO offer and might have come back for more at a higher price. (RASPBERRY) JAM TODAY Founded by chief executive Eben Upton in 2012 to make computing more accessible to young people,   designs and develops low-cost SBCs (single board computers) and compute modules for industrial customers, enthusiasts and educators around the world. Investors are clearly enthused by Raspberry Pi, a profitable, established name that isn’t reliant on the ‘jam tomorrow’ story that often props up technology IPOs. The company has a large community of users; it makes money rather than simply being a bright idea that is not yet commercialised; and there is a strong social angle as Raspberry Pi has education built into its business model. Backed by strategic shareholders  Sony (6758:TYO)  and  Arm (ARM:NASDAQ) , Raspberry Pi believes it can sustain its strong growth trajectory in a TAM (total addressable market) worth some $21.2 billion (£16.7 billion). Pre-tax profit powered up by an impressive 90% to $38.2 million last year. However, the company has flagged volatility in customer demand in 2024-to-date, which has led to ‘higher than usual levels of inventory’, although management expects this to normalise over the course of 2024 ‘resulting in stronger results in the second half of the year than in the first half’. BRAND AWARENESS BOOST Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said a key reason why companies float on the stock market is to raise brand awareness and boost their reputation. ‘Being a listed company means the accounts are transparent and everything it does is in full public view. A lot of people like this openness and it can help to drive more business as people often have greater trust in the company,’ explained Mould. ‘Having a successful IPO also raises awareness of a stock among the investment community and Raspberry Pi has been the talk of the town after its stock market debut went off with a bang earlier this week.’ Disclaimer: Financial services firm AJ Bell owns Shares Magazine.

The shares edged up 4p or 1.4% to 307p as analysts and investors digested the detail of the update. STRONG SALES GROWTH For the 13 weeks to 25 May, Tesco reported UK and Ireland sales of £14.33 billion, an increase of 3.6% on a like-for-like basis, although these figures were let down slightly by the Booker wholesale operation which posted a 1.3% drop in turnover. Core UK like-for-like revenue was up 4.6% to £11.37 billion as the firm grew its market share at the fastest pace in two years supported by 15 consecutive periods of switching gains according to figures from retail consultant Kantar. Food sales rose 5% during the quarter thanks to strong volume growth, particularly in fresh produce, driven by its Aldi Price Match and Clubcard offers, while inflation continued to decline during the period. Sales of its upmarket  Finest  range were up 12.5% due to continued net switching gains from  Marks & Spencer  ( )  and Waitrose, and the firm has just launched a new Dine-In range ahead of the ‘summer of sport’. Booker revenue dipped to £2.23 billion due to a reduction in tobacco distribution and exiting less profitable contracts during the period, although ultimately both developments should help group margins in the long run. Chief executive Ken Murphy   himself ‘very happy with the progress we’ve made’ and claimed Tesco was ‘the most competitive we’ve ever been, with our value, product quality and service driving better brand perception and customer satisfaction’ as shown by the level of switching from rival retailers. EXPERT VIEWS Shore Capital’s head of consumer research Clive Black commented: ‘With little new space and against tough inflation-fuelled comparatives, Tesco is gaining UK market share, which we see as especially commendable. ‘Unsurprisingly, group guidance is unchanged early doors, so we do not change our estimates. Trading on a FY25 PE (price-to-earnings) ratio of 11.7x, an EV/EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) multiple of 6.7x with a yield of 4.3%, and well into its buyback programme, we believe Tesco is now an accomplished cash compounder.’ Jefferies analyst James Grzinic added: ‘As broadly anticipated by industry market share data, Tesco’s Q1 sales show a strong trajectory. This should come as little surprise to a market well aware of these dynamics. ‘We continue to focus on the attractions of Tesco: a strengthening competitive moat driving share gains in a UK market with stable food inflation and ongoing mix/volume rebuild, all in the face of a consensus view with scope for upgrades later in the year.’ You can opt out at any time."},

Thousands of shareholders voted to back Elon Musk’s enormous $56 billion compensation deal, the biggest in corporate history. This was a huge vote of confidence in the Tesla chief executive and his ability to power the share price, turning retail investors’ money molehills into mountains. Total returns tot up to nearly 30% a year over the past decade, and an astonishing 66.5% yearly over five years, numbers that are difficult to argue with. That must be why investors are largely happy to dismiss the flagging 2024 performance – the stock has fallen 27% year-to-date, and it barely budged in after-hours trading at $184.75. THOUSANDS TUNE IN TO PRESENTATION Tesla is yet to disclose the voting tallies, which are expected to be revealed in coming days, but Reuters reported at least a half-million viewers watched the presentation on the livestream on social media platform X, and about 40,000 watched on YouTube. Huge retail investor backing helped offset vocal opposition from several institutional investors and proxy groups who had flagged concerns over the size of the pay deal. They now risk being cast as curmudgeons, a sort of Statler and Waldorf to the retail army’s Kermit or Fuzzy Bear. Either way, getting the pay deal backed, and Tesla’s move to reincorporate in Texas, won’t stop an ongoing lawsuit over Musk’s previous pay deal, which a Delaware judge described as ‘unfathomable’.

Hot-on-the-heels of the US Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan last week, the Reserve Bank of Australia and Bank of England announce rate decisions on Tuesday and Thursday. Both are expected to leave rates unmoved. The BoE will have a UK inflation reading to mull over on the eve of its decision, however. Swissquote analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya commented: ‘The week will be interesting for the UK. The latest British inflation numbers are due on Wednesday and the Bank of England decision is due on Thursday. Inflation may have eased to the 2% in May in Britain, right to the BoE’s policy target, but the BoE is not expected to cut rates before the July general election, and inflation is seen rebounding toward 2.5% in the second half, anyway. ‘But a sufficiently soft inflation read and a sufficiently soft BoE statement could fuel the expectation of a cut in September - and one more in December, and encourage the sterling bears to push cable into a medium term bearish consolidation zone, as well.’ The pound was quoted at $1.2673 early Monday in London, down from $1.2683 at the time of the European equities close Friday. The euro edged up to $1.0706 from $1.0698, while against the yen, the dollar rose to JP¥157.54 from JP¥157.36. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak returns to the campaign trail on Monday. He is heading to East Yorkshire, the East Midlands and East of England after a pause in campaigning for his prime ministerial duties. He attended the G7 summit in Italy on Thursday and Friday, followed on Saturday by Trooping the Colour and a major international summit on Ukraine in Switzerland. Opinion polls continue to show his party crashing to defeat, with one survey published during his absence showing Reform UK edging ahead of the Conservatives for the first time. Although it was within the margin of error and other surveys since then have showed Nigel Farage’s outfit trailing the Conservatives, it came as a major blow to the Tories and preceded warnings by other pollsters of ‘electoral extinction’ for the party. France, meanwhile, began less than a fortnight of frenetic election campaigning for snap polls called by President Emmanuel Macron to combat the far right. Candidates had until Sunday evening to register for the 577 seats in the lower house National Assembly ahead of the official start of campaigning from midnight for the June 30 first round. The decisive second round takes place on July 7. The snap election call rattled European markets last week. XTB analyst Kathleen Brooks commented: ‘Politics are a serious threat to financial market stability in 2024. Unexpected results in India and Mexico, along with the prospect of Marine Le Pen’s party winning enough seats in France’s parliamentary elections to form a government, are causing havoc as we move towards the end of the second quarter. ’ In London, miners struggled in early dealings on the back of mixed China data. China is a major buyer of minerals. Rio Tinto fell 1.4%, Anglo American lost 0.9% and Glencore fell 0.5%. Chinese retail sales picked up in May but industrial production growth slowed, official data showed Monday, suggesting the recovery in the world’s second-largest economy remains uneven.

However, industrial production growth slowed, with May’s 5.6% expansion well down from 6.7% in April and short of the 6.2% forecast in the Bloomberg survey. Back in London, Mind Gym shares plunged 29%. The personal and business coaching service reported weaker annual earnings, and expects the new year to be one of ‘recalibration’. Revenue in the year to March 31 declined 18% to £44.9 million from £55.0 million. It swung to a £12.1 million pretax loss, from profit of £5.3 million. ‘FY25 will be a year of recalibration as we implement the new strategy which will return MindGym to its historic performance levels. Whilst it will take time before the full benefit of this new strategy is realised, the board expects Ebitda profitability and cash generation in FY25,’ it said. Contango Holdings shot up 44% as it reported it has brought in a Chinese investor for its Muchesu coal project in Zimbabwe. Wencai Huo, a Zimbabwe-based Chinese national, will buy a 51% stake in the asset. Huo, who has ‘extensive mining and business investments in Zimbabwe’, will enter into a subscription deal to acquire a 20% stake in Contango. Contango currently holds a 70% stake in Muchesu, with its holding soon rising to just under 75%. Following the stake sale to Huo, Contango will own just under 24% of the asset. Huo will match Contango’s historic expenditure of around $20 million into Muchesu. Contango Chief Executive Officer Carl Esprey said: ‘Huo is highly experienced in mining and operating throughout southern Africa. His intention to become a major shareholder in Contango, as well as become the lead partner in the project, is testament to the upside this agreement offers to shareholders. By investing a further $20 million at Muchesu we will be able to quickly ramp up operations and satisfy some of the larger contracts we have been reviewing or are aware of.

In European equities on Friday, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 2.5%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was down 1.1%. The CAC continued to struggle on Friday. Over the past five-days, it is down 6.5%. On Sunday, following the EU elections, President Macron called a snap election. This has created political uncertainty in the company, with the right and left divided. The UK also remains divided politically. Reform UK has overtaken the Conservatives in a major opinion poll, as UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak continues his absence from the general election campaign trail to meet world leaders in Italy. A YouGov survey commissioned by the Times newspaper had Nigel Farage’s party at 19% to the Conservatives 18% in voting intention, in a crossover moment which is the latest blow to Tory hopes of returning to government. In early economic news, the Eurozone swung to a trade surplus annually in April, as exports shot up, Eurostat reported on Friday. According to first estimate, the eurozone reported a trade surplus of €15.0 billion in April, compared to a deficit of €11.1 billion a year earlier. Exports of goods to the rest of the world in April were €247.6 billion, up 14% annually. Imports from the rest of the world stood at €232.5 billion, up 1.8%. The pound was quoted at $1.2705 at midday on Friday in London, down compared to $1.2764 at the equities close on Thursday. The euro stood at $1.0683, lower against $1.0763. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥157.02, higher compared to JP¥156.88. In the FTSE 100, Tesco rose 2.8% to the top of the index. The grocer said like-for-like sales in the 13 weeks to May 25, the financial first quarter, rose 3.4% to £15.31 billion. The UK outperformed with comparable sales up 4.6% to £11.4 billion.

Chief Executive Ken Murphy said: ‘Following another strong quarter, we’re pleased to reiterate our guidance for the full year, with sales trends in line with our expectations and the business well-positioned for the months ahead.’ Crest Nicholson and Bellway bookmarked the FTSE 250 index, with Crest up 8.6% and Bellway down 3.9%. Crest said it has rejected a revised all-share offer from Bellway. On Thursday, Bellway made a new takeover proposal for Crest, but said it had been rejected. Bellway said under the terms of the bid, Crest Nicholson investors would have stood to receive 0.093 of a Bellway share for each Crest Nicholson share. It valued Crest Nicholson shares at 253.00 pence each, the company’s equity overall at around £650.0 million. However, after evaluating the revised proposal with financial advisers, the board of Crest rejected the offer having concluded that the offer ‘significantly undervalued’ the company and its future stand alone prospects. Elsewhere in London, Raspberry Pi jumped 17%. The budget compute firm’s shares hit the open market for retail investors. On Tuesday, the stock was made available to institutional shareholders. Since then, the stock is up 23%. Friday’s gains indicated that demand is also high among ordinary retail investors, after the IPO was hyped as a welcome victory for the London market. AJ Bell’s Russ Mould commented: “Having a successful IPO also raises awareness of a stock among the investment community and Raspberry Pi has been the talk of the town after its stock market debut went off with a bang earlier this week.‘ On AIM, Bradda Head Lithium rose 18%. The North American-focused lithium explorer provided drill hole geochemical results for its Basin project in Arizona.

The FTSE 100 index closed down 16.81 points, 0.2%, at 8,146.86. The FTSE 250 ended down 75.59 points, 0.4%, at 20,120.36, and the AIM All-Share lost 4.39 points, 0.6%, at 776.04. For the week, the FTSE 100 fell 1.2%, the FTSE 250 lost 2.1%, and AIM All-Share gave back 2.2%. The Cboe UK 100 ended down 0.2% at 811.22 on Friday, the Cboe UK 250 fell 1.0% at 17,506.91, and the Cboe Small Companies dropped 1.7% to 16,453.58. In European equities on Friday, the CAC 40 in Paris plunged 2.7%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was down 1.4%. The CAC 40, losing more than 6%, suffered its worst week since March 2022. ‘The CAC 40 has been under intense pressure,’ XTB analyst Kathleen Brooks commented. ‘The risk is that there could be more volatility as we lead up to next week’s first round of voting in the French parliamentary election. Marine Le Pen’s party are expected to get the largest amount of votes, but they may fall short of an outright majority. The risk of a win for Marine Le Pen and a shift in parliamentary power in France to the hard right is fuelling the sell-off in French stocks, and the sell-off in French banks in particular. While there might be some respite from the selling at the end of the week, we think this will be temporary, as political uncertainty may continue to weigh on sentiment.’ France’s left put up a united front on Friday, vowing a ‘total break’ with President Emmanuel Macron’s policies if it wins historic polls that could propel the far right to major gains in parliament. Far-right figurehead Marine Le Pen, also making a pitch to voters, pledged a ‘national unity government’ if her party takes power in the snap legislative elections. President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday stunned France by calling polls after Le Pen’s far-right National Rally scored more than double the number of votes of his centrist alliance in last week’s European elections. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3%, the S&P 500 was 0.2% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1%. The pound was quoted at $1.2683 late in London on Friday afternoon, down compared to $1.2764 at the time of equities close on Thursday. The euro stood at $1.0698, lower against $1.0763. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥157.36, higher compared to JP¥156.88. The Bank of Japan on Friday said it would trim its vast hoard of government bonds as it cautiously steps away from its long-running ultra-loose monetary policy. The central bank kept interest rates unchanged after a two-day meeting but announced plans to ‘reduce its purchase amount of JGBs thereafter to ensure that long-term interest rates would be formed more freely’. ‘A detailed plan’ for the reduction ‘during the next one to two years or so’ will be decided at the next policy meeting in July, it said. ING analyst Chris Turner commented: ‘USD/JPY has traded higher after the BoJ failed to offer much support to the yen today. It seems many in the market are now looking for USD/JPY to push onto 160 and test whether policymakers in Tokyo are prepared to intervene again.’ In the FTSE 100, Tesco rose 2.6%. The grocer said like-for-like sales in the 13 weeks to May 25, the financial first quarter, rose 3.4% to £15.31 billion. The UK outperformed with comparable sales up 4.6% to £11.4 billion. Booker sales fell 1.3%, Central Europe sales rose 0.6% while in the Republic of Ireland sales climbed 4.4%. Chief Executive Ken Murphy said: ‘Following another strong quarter, we’re pleased to reiterate our guidance for the full year, with sales trends in line with our expectations and the business well-positioned for the months ahead.’ Crest Nicholson and Bellway sat either side of the FTSE 250 index, with Crest up 8.6% and Bellway down 4.4%. Crest said it has rejected a revised all-share offer from Bellway. On Thursday, Bellway made a new takeover proposal for Crest, but said it had been rejected. Bellway said under the terms of the bid, Crest Nicholson investors would have stood to receive 0.093 of a Bellway share for each Crest Nicholson share. It valued Crest Nicholson shares at 253.00 pence each, the company’s equity overall at around £650.0 million. However, after evaluating the revised proposal with financial advisers, the board of Crest rejected the offer having concluded that the offer ‘significantly undervalued’ the company and its future stand alone prospects. Harworth Group added 2.5%. The regenerator of land and property for sustainable development and investment said it received a resolution from North Yorkshire Council’s Strategic Planning Committee granting planning permission to develop a major rail-connected industrial and logistics site. Located at Gascoigne Interchange, a 185-acre brownfield site in Leeds, the development will create up to 1.5 million square feet of space with a gross development value of £190 million.

Amongst individual stocks, Rentokil led the FTSE 100 higher, as investor Nelson Peltz built a stake in the company. Financial stocks were also faring well ahead of the interest rate decision. The FTSE 100 index was up 54.55 points, 0.7%, at 8,202.36. The FTSE 250 was up 22.69 points, 0.1%, at 20,289.54, and the AIM All-Share was up 2.14 points, 0.3%, at 783.65. The Cboe UK 100 was down 0.7% at 817.12, the Cboe UK 250 was down 0.1% at 17,741.22, and the Cboe Small Companies was down 0.4% at 16,704.18. In European equities on Wednesday, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.4%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was up 0.6%. It is a big day in the economic calendar for the US. It will begin with US inflation, which is due out at 1330 BST, and will end with the latest interest rate decision from the US Fed at 1900 BST. ‘Each of these events are typically a source of volatility in their own right and together they promise an eventful North American session,’ said analysts at Bannockburn. Starting with inflation, according to FXStreet, the annual rate of consumer price inflation is expected to have remained unmoved at 3.4% in May, where it stood in April. The annual rate of core inflation is expected to have ebbed to 3.5% from 3.6%. The data may impact the tone of the evening’s interest rate decision. The Fed is expected to maintain interest rates at the current level once again, and the focus Wednesday will be on what it reveals in its latest projections, with the prospect of a hat-trick of cuts this year all but over. Following the decision, a press conference with Powell will follow half an hour later. ‘The Fed is almost certain to keep rates on hold at today’s meeting so the focus will be on any commentary that provides insight into the future trajectory of rates. Expectations for rate cuts have been pushed back, particularly in light of last week’s hotter than expected US jobs data,’ said AJ Bell’s Russ Mould. Friday’s eagerly awaited US jobs report had showed the pace of hiring picked up by more than expected in May. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nonfarm payroll employment rose by 272,000 in May. This was ahead of a FXStreet consensus of 185,000 and higher than the average monthly gain of 232,000 over the prior 12 months. Stocks in New York were called higher, as investors shake off Fed nerves. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index were called up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.2%. London’s financial stocks were doing well ahead of the decision. Standard Chartered, Lloyds, and NatWest were up 2.9%, 2.0%, and 1.8%, respectively. The pound was quoted at $1.2757 at midday on Wednesday in London, up compared to $1.2722 at the equities close on Tuesday. The euro stood at $1.0758, higher against $1.0727. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥157.35, up compared to JP¥157.26. In the FTSE 100, Rentokil led the charge, jumping 12%. The activist investment firm of billionaire investor Nelson Peltz has become a major stakeholder in Rentokil Initial PLC, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. Trian Fund Management LP is now a top 10 shareholder in the Crawley, England-based pest control and hygiene firm, Bloomberg said, adding it isn’t clear the exact size of the stake. On the other hand, Legal & General lost 3.8%, making it the worst performing FTSE 100 stock at midday. L&G announced plans for a ‘simpler and better-connected business’, focused on three core divisions, alongside a share buyback, as new Chief Executive Antonio Simoes attempts to make his mark on the London-based insurer. ‘Over the last five months we have rigorously reviewed our business, listening to investors, customers, partners and employees. This work has deepened my belief in our strong foundations and excellent potential,’ Simoes commented. In the FTSE 250, Molten Ventures jumped 14%. The London-based venture capital firm reported that net asset value per share declined 15% to 662 pence per share as at March 31 from 780p a year prior. Despite this, pretax loss narrowed to £49.8 million in the year ended March 31 from £246.7 million a year earlier. Molten posted an unrealised loss on the revaluation of investments of £29.0 million, sharply narrowed from £240.1 million a year prior. Amongst London’s small-caps, DFS Furniture lost 4.0%, after it warned of a weak trading environment and Red Sea shipping delays. The sofa retailer now expects an adjusted pretax profit of between £10 million and £12 million, down from a previous guidance back in March of £20 million to £25 million. It anticipates revenue between £995 million and £1.00 billion, lower than £1.00 billion to £1.02 billion it had previously expected. On London’s AIM, Tungsten West jumped 30%. The miner said the Environment Agency has granted the company a permit to operate its mineral processing facility, within the limits previously agreed between the company and the Environment Agency. This is the last of the key permits required to further progress the Hemerdon tungsten and tin mine project in Devon, UK. Brent oil was quoted at $82.79 a barrel at midday in London on Wednesday, up from $81.74 late Tuesday. Gold was quoted at $2,313.30 an ounce, higher against $2,312.47.

That seems to be the case for  Oracle (ORCL:NASDAQ) , which jumped 9% overnight even as its fiscal fourth-quarter results fell short of Wall Street estimates. That implies a new all-time peak for Oracle shares of $134.50. Oracle said on Tuesday (11 Jun) it had struck two new AI partnerships that will leverage the data giant’s AI infrastructure, one with ChatGPT developer Open AI and its backer  Microsoft (MSFT:NASDAQ) , the other with  Alphabet’s (GOOG:NASDAQ)  Google Cloud. Teaming up with Microsoft and OpenAl will help extend the former’s Azure Al platform and provide extra capacity for OpenAl. It is a similar deal with Google Cloud, where the pair will integrate their powerful cloud computing capabilities inside Google Cloud, including the building of a dozen new datacentres. ‘We expect the Oracle database to be available within the Google Cloud in September this year’, Oracle said. QUARTERLY MISS So, what of the quarterly miss? In truth, it was a mild one, with Q4 adjusted EPS (earnings per share) coming in at $1.63 on revenue of $14.3 billion, versus Wall Street consensus pitched at $1.65 on revenue of $14.6 billion. Remaining performance obligations, a gauge of booked revenue, climbed 44% to $98 billion, which would have helped lift the mood, with Oracle recognising more cloud revenue than licence support for the second consecutive quarter, according to Megabuyte’s Jack Wilson-Fowler. ‘This is being aided by rising demand for training AI LLMs (large language models) in the Oracle Cloud, with the group signing over 30 AI-related contracts in Q4 alone, totalling more than $12.5 billion’, said Wilson-Fowler. This has fed into a bullish outlook from management, ‘with its double-digit growth guidance for full year 2025 coming in ahead of the market’s expectations for high-single-digit growth.’ You can opt out at any time."},

Results from European elections hurt equities on the continent, the CAC 40 in Paris in particular, though Wednesday’s US data offered stocks some relief. All eyes will be on whether there is a hawkish or dovish tilt to the Fed’s decision, projections and subsequent press conference with Chair Jerome Powell later. The FTSE 100 index ended up 67.67 points, 0.8%, at 8,215.48. The FTSE 250 closed up 230.55 points, 1.1%, at 20,497.40, and the AIM All-Share rose 5.85 points, 0.8%, at 787.36. The Cboe UK 100 surged 1.0% to 819.42, the Cboe UK 250 jumped 1.2% to 17,970.81, and the Cboe Small Companies rose 0.1% at 16,780.99. In European equities on Wednesday, the CAC 40 in Paris ended up 1.0%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt rose 1.4%. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3% higher, the S&P 500 surged 1.2% and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.9%. The pound was quoted at $1.2836 at the time of the London equities close on Wednesday, up from $1.2722 at the same time on Tuesday. The euro stood at $1.0848, higher against $1.0727. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥155.77, markedly lower compared to JP¥157.26. ‘Lighter than expected US inflation figures have fired up the market and got investors rubbing their hands, predicting the rate cut gravy train will start its journey soon,’ AJ Bell analyst Dan Coatsworth commented. ‘Equities bounced on the news, but we’ve been here plenty of times before. While inflation is slowing, it remains well above the 2% target and so one shouldn’t expect a rate cut at the Fed’s meeting later today.’ The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the year-on-year US consumer price inflation rate cooled to 3.3% in May from 3.4% in April. According to FXStreet, markets were expecting the rate of inflation to be steady, however. On a monthly basis, consumer prices were flat, easing from a 0.3% rise in April from March. Prices had been expected to register a 0.1% increase. The yearly core inflation rate, which strips out food and energy, eased to 3.4% from 3.6%. Markets had been expecting prices to cool to just 3.5%. ING analysts commented: ‘This needs to become the trend after a series of far too hot readings at the start of the year. We think it will be and with unemployment on the rise we expect the Fed to cut rates in September. ‘Today’s outcome following on from the April core PCE deflator and the Beige Book summary should give the Fed the confidence to amend the sentence in the FOMC statement that previously said ’in recent months, there has been a lack of further progress toward the committee’s 2% inflation objective’. It should also allow a dovish spin from the Fed’s Powell this afternoon even if the Fed themselves surprise and switch to projecting just one rate cut from the three cuts they projected at their March forecast update.’ In London, Rentokil jumped 14%. The activist investment firm of billionaire investor Nelson Peltz has become a major stakeholder in Rentokil, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. Trian Fund Management is now a top 10 shareholder in the Crawley, England-based pest control and hygiene firm, Bloomberg said, adding it isn’t clear the exact size of the stake. Analysts at Citi said although Trian has not yet set out any plans for its investment, ‘we think it is possible that they ask for a relisting of Rentokil in the US given the valuation gap with its rival pest operator Rollins Inc.’ On the other hand, Legal & General lost 5.5%, making it the worst performing FTSE 100 stock at midday. L&G announced plans for a ‘simpler and better-connected business’, focused on three core divisions, alongside a share buyback, as new Chief Executive Antonio Simoes attempts to make his mark on the London-based insurer. ‘Over the last five months we have rigorously reviewed our business, listening to investors, customers, partners and employees. This work has deepened my belief in our strong foundations and excellent potential,’ Simoes commented. Tool and equipment hire firm HSS Hire Group slumped 14% after it said it has lost Amey as a client. HSS said it has been notified by Amey of its decision to move to another supplier for the provision of its equipment-rental managed service contract. The supplier agreement will end early December. The agreement, which began in December 2015, accounted for approximately 7% of HSS revenue and 10% of adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in 2023. Amey is a London-based provider of engineering services for transport infrastructure. FirstGroup fell 4.4% as its Avanti West Coast joint-venture received some scrutiny from the UK opposition Labour party. Labour has said it will urgently consider stripping Avanti West Coast of its train operating contract if it wins the UK general election, PA reported. Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh claimed the company has provided ‘woeful service’ on the West Coast Main Line. Office of Rail & Road figures show Avanti West Coast had the third worst reliability of all operators in Britain in the year to the end of March, with the equivalent of one in 15 trains, or 6.9%, cancelled. The Conservative government awarded Avanti West Coast – owned by FirstGroup and Trenitalia – a new long-term contract starting in October last year. The agreement is for up to nine years but can be terminated with three months’ notice at any point from October 2026.

The portfolio currently is well diversified across stocks and sectors with a range of different economic characteristics. The most significant positions in the portfolio (which we define as holdings whose weightings are most different from that of the index) are the retailers Dunelm, Marks & Spencer and Tesco, the energy company Centrica, and the banking group NatWest. The Trust has below average (versus the index weight) holdings in the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, Diageo, RELX, HSBC and the mining company Rio Tinto. As at 31 March 2024, we held 5.6% of the portfolio in non-UK stocks. We use this element of the portfolio to gain access to businesses with the kind of characteristics or features that we seek but which are not  available on the UK stockmarket. The principal non-UK holding was Verisk Analytics, a world-leading data technology business. Other overseas holdings include the pharmaceutical company Novartis, the semiconductor company Intel and Newmont Mining. Rotork, a recent purchase, is an excellent example of the features we find appealing in a company. Rotork is a market leading industrials company in flow control and instrumentation products. It is exposed to attractive long-term growth drivers such as oil and gas upstream electrification and industrial process automation. Rotork is the market leader in pneumatic actuators and has a strong long-term track record of product quality and reliability. Where it has had more challenges historically has been with organic growth, which the new chief executive is addressing through a strategy to focus the business on higher growth business lines, reinforcing and improving the customer value proposition, and improving innovation. If successful, this shift in the business should lead to mid to high single digit sales growth and gentle margin accretion over the medium term. Outlook From a macroeconomic perspective, we are mindful of changing expectations for the path of interest rate normalisation, as inflation remains more entrenched than expected. This period of heightened monetary policy uncertainty coincides with a period of elevated geopolitical risks, making a flexible and pragmatic approach to managing a portfolio important. Looking forward, we expect risks to remain high, with 2024 seeing a significant number of elections globally in countries accounting for over 50% of global GDP and over 50% of the global population. China continues to face growth headwinds as the economy seeks to transition from an investment led to a more balanced model with consumption led growth. With consumer confidence in China intimately tied to the property market, this transition is unlikely to be smooth. With the elevated uncertainty across a range of factors, our focus remains on owning businesses where growth is helped by exposure to structural growth tailwinds, or where there is a change in industry structure or company strategy which will enable future profit growth. Our confidence in Edinburgh Investment Trust’s portfolio comes from owning strong businesses managed by intelligent management teams executing on their business plans to drive total shareholder returns.

In March, the UK living room furniture leader warned pre-tax profits for the year to June 2024 would be between £20 million and £25 million, but also flagged ‘additional profit risk’ of up to £4 million if Red Sea shipping delays continued. Since then, consumer demand has remained weak and Red Sea disruption has persisted, causing delays to customer deliveries and saddling DFS with higher freight costs. As a result, the home improvement retailer now expects annual pre-tax profits to fall in the £10 million to £12 million range and has massaged sales guidance down from the £1 billion mark to between £995 million and £1 billion. DEMAND AT RECORD LOWS  explained that upholstery sector market demand has plunged to record lows as consumers wrestle with cost-of-living pressures, but the sofas, recliners and mattresses seller insisted it is well placed to capitalise on any market recovery given its record market share of over 38.5%. The retailer also stressed that gross margin gains and cost reductions have cushioned the impact of lower sales on its profitability. ENCOURAGING ORDER UPTICK DFS said the £12 million to £14 million of delayed deliveries are expected to move into the next financial year and has also been ‘encouraged by an improving trend’ in orders, which are up over 9% in the fourth quarter to date. This recent improvement comes as DFS laps weaker prior year comparatives and reflects winning initiatives to strengthen the product range and pricing in its Sofology business, as well as the reintroduction of four year interest free credit at select times to maximise sales in a tough trading environment. ‘Whilst the economic outlook remains hard to predict we expect the widely predicted lower inflation and interest rate environment to have a positive impact on upholstery market demand levels with the declines experienced across the last three years starting to reverse and the market slowly recovering in our full year 2025 period,’ said the company.

Other housebuilding shares fell, albeit more modestly, in sympathy. It reported an adjusted operating profit of £6.2 million for the six months ending 30 April, a 71.9% fall compared to the same period a year ago. The adjusted operating profit figure included a one-off £5.9 million charge related to completed sites. ‘As a result, and including the one-off pre-exceptional charge for completed sites, the group expects full year 2024 adjusted pre-tax profit to be between £22 million to £29 million,’ said Crest Nicholson. This is materially below analyst expectations of £38 million. The company reported an adjusted pre-tax profit of £2.6 million, a fall of 87.6% for the first six months of the year. Crest Nicholson shareholders ‘felt the pinch’ as the board declared an interim dividend of 1p per share compared to 5.5p per share in the same period a year ago. It has not been a good year so far for the company, back in March the firm had decided to take a large remediation charge for build defects. The company said: ‘The imminent general election is creating some short-term uncertainty, but this is anticipated to be alleviated in July once the outcome is known.’ CEO TO STEP DOWN As previously announced on 23 January 2024, CEO Peter Truscott will retire from the board on 14 June after joining Crest Nicholson in 2019. Martyn Clark will take over as CEO on 14 June. Clark was previously the (chief commercial officer) COO of rival housebuilder  Persimmon  ( ) . Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell said: ‘The housebuilding sector was supposed to be on the path to recovery, but Crest Nicholson’s latest results are at odds with that narrative. ‘The company says since Easter it has seen a softening of the momentum which had built up at the start of the year. ‘The company and the wider sector will hope this relates more to short-term uncertainty around the election than the fact interest rates look set to stick at a higher level for longer than hoped. ‘This has translated into volatility in the mortgage market and slowed the hoped-for reduction in borrowing costs which is such a crucial driver of demand.’ DISCLAIMER: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in this article owns Shares magazine.

The shares remain 90% below the highs reached in 2021 following a string of profit warnings and a strategy reset to focus on the company’s core CMS (creative management simulation) games. A strong second-half performance from the fantasy games developer’s back catalogue and the successful release of  Planet Zoo: Console Edition  resulted in   for the year to 31 May coming in at £89 million, comfortably ahead of the ‘beaten-down’ analyst consensus of £85.6 million. FULL-YEAR PROFIT BEAT Operating costs were reduced by 20% during the second half, which pushed the business into profit on an adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation) basis. The company said it expects full year adjusted EBITDA to be in profit by around £0.5 million, including proceeds of $7 million from the sale of  RollerCoaster Tycoon 3  to Atari, compared with market expectations of a £5 million loss. Frontier ended the year with net cash of £29.5 million, up slightly on the £28.3 million recorded on 31 May 2023. Looking ahead, chief executive Jonny Watts commented: ‘We have started the new financial year reset and refocused, with a clear strategy and sustainable cost base. We have a game portfolio that continues to deliver pleasing results and an exciting CMS-led roadmap ahead. ‘I look forward to the launch of  F1® Manager 2024  next month, and to revealing the details of our own-IP CMS game coming later in the financial year’. The company reaffirmed it intended to release three CMS games over the next three consecutive financial years. These include an unnamed own-IP (intellectual property) game, on track for delivery in the current financial year. The title will be revealed in the coming months. EXPERT VIEW Analysts at Liberum increased their 2024 revenue forecast by 4% and nudged up adjusted EBITDA into positive territory. For 2025 the upgrades are more muted with a minor revenue upgrade to £87 million, in line with management guidance. Liberum revised its 2025 adjusted EBITDA forecast to a loss of £2.6 million from a loss of £3.7 million. The broker believes its forecasts are conservatively-based and leave room for upgrades given it believes ‘a clear inflection point’ has been reached. You can opt out at any time."},

The US Federal Reserve left interest rates unmoved on Wednesday, as expected, and the central bank signalled just one cut could be in the offing before the end of the year. The central bank maintained the federal funds rate range at 5.25% to 5.50%. The Fed added: ‘The committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.’ Focus was on the Fed’s latest economic projections, which includes the dot-plot of median interest rate expectations. The chart suggests only one cut could be forthcoming before the end of 2024. The previous projection suggested three. The decision followed the Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting that the year-on-year US consumer price inflation rate cooled to 3.3% in May from 3.4% in April. According to FXStreet, markets were expecting the rate of inflation to be steady, however. The pound was quoted at $1.2789 early on Thursday in London, lower compared to $1.2836 at the equities close on Wednesday. The euro stood at $1.0815, down against $1.0848.

In the FTSE 250, Crest Nicholson fell 10%. Revenue in the six months ended April 30 fell to £257.5 million from £282.7 million a year earlier.

Results for the year to 30 March 2024 were broadly in line with consensus market expectations, which explains the muted reaction from investors with the shares edging just 0.6% higher to 720p. Over the past year the stock is up by a third reflecting consistently positive trading over the period. Looking ahead, the company said sales momentum has continued into the new financial year with like-for-like   up 4.4% in the 10-weeks to 8 June. Chief executive Simon Emeny commented: ‘As a company, we are primed for further success and growth. We will continue with our share buyback programme, and we will benefit from the sale of The Mad Hatter in July 2024 for a total consideration of £20 million, and £18.3 million from the sale of 37 non-core pubs to Admiral Taverns’. STRONG SHAREHOLDER RETURNS The business generated strong cash flow with cash from operations jumping 46% to £68.3 million.

The company intends to buy a further 2.5 million ‘A’ shares, taking the total share buyback to 6.5 million, equivalent to the shares issued in the 2021 equity raise at £8.30 per share in response to the pandemic. EXPERT VIEWS Liberum’s Anna Barnfather said receding inflationary pressures and management’s ‘additional confidence’ in the coming year, provided mid-single digit upside to forecasts driven by increasing margins. ‘Consensus FY25E forecasts are for revenue of £353.9 million, EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation) of £63.6 million and pre-tax profit of £23.9 million and our forecasts are broadly in line with this’, added Barnfather. Deutsche Numis commented: ‘The earlier timing of Easter and adverse weather in April impacted across the sector but Fullers has outperformed. We expect the underlying demand recovery in the City and West End to continue in FY25. ‘The message on costs is reassuring: “inflationary pressures – especially in regard to food and energy – have reduced”, which gives us additional confidence in the coming year.’ You can opt out at any time."},

In European equities on Thursday, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 1.2%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was down 1.1%. The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday signalled that there could be just one interest rate cut this year, backpedalled from previous predictions. Back in March, the Fed’s dot plot implied four cuts. Also on Wednesday, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the year-on-year consumer price inflation rate cooled to 3.3% in May from 3.4% in April. According to FXStreet, markets were expecting another 3.4% increase. ‘Fed chair Jerome Powell didn’t give a huge amount away, although it felt telling that he was fairly cautious about the cooler than expected inflation figures from earlier in the day. The central bank is clear that it wants further signs inflation is on the path to the magic 2% level before it is prepared to start cutting rates. One major sticking point being the continued tight labour market conditions,’ said AJ Bell’s Russ Mould. Stocks in New York were called to open mixed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was called down 0.4%, the S&P 500 index flat, and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.5%. The pound was quoted at $1.2780 at midday on Thursday in London, lower compared to $1.2836 at the equities close on Wednesday. The euro stood at $1.0802, down against $1.0848. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥157.17, much higher compared to JP¥155.77. ‘The Japanese yen edged lower against a basket of major currencies in the early session, as the market widely anticipates that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will maintain its current interest rates in its upcoming policy decision on Friday,’ said Daniel Takieddine at BDSwiss. In the FTSE 100, Halma surged 10% to the top of the index. The Buckinghamshire, England-based safety equipment maker said pretax profit jumped 17% to £340.3 million in the financial year ended March 31 from £291.5 million a year prior, as revenue climbed 9.8% to £2.03 billion from £1.85 billion. The company noted sound overall demand for its products and services, with the Environmental & Analysis sector delivering ‘very strong revenue growth’ in the photonics business, and supported by Water Treatment and Analysis. Environmental & Analysis revenue surged 19% to £658.4 million from £552.1 million. Halma recommended a final dividend of 13.20 pence per share, up 7.0% from 12.34p a year prior.

BT Group edged up 2.9% Grupo Financiero Inbursa SAB de CV, the Mexico City-based investment vehicle of multi-billionaire Carlos Slim has bought a 3.2% stake in BT, crossing that ownership threshold on Thursday last week, according to a stock exchange disclosure on Wednesday.

In the FTSE 250, Crest Nicholson lost 8.7%, after it slashed its interim dividend. Crest Nicholson reported a £30.9 million pretax loss for the six months to April 30, swung from a £28.4 million profit a year before. Revenue decreased 8.9% to £257.5 million from £282.7 million, as home completions decreased 12% to 788 from 894. Crest Nicholson declared a 1.00p per share interim dividend, down 82% from the 5.50p it returned for first half of last year.

The Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire-based store payment service provider said that in the financial year that ended March 31, pretax profit rose 13% to £48.2 million from £42.6 million the previous year. Revenue increased by 83% to £306.4 million from £167.7 million reflecting the first full year since the company acquired the Love2shop business. PayPoint said it will launch a three-year share buyback programme that will return a minimum of £20 million to shareholders over the next 12 months with potential increases, it said, depending on performance, market conditions, cash generation, and the general capital needs of the business.

The FTSE 100 index closed down 51.81 points, 0.6%, at 8,163.67. The FTSE 250 fell 301.45 points, 1.5%, at 20,195.95, and the AIM All-Share fell 6.93 points, 0.9%, at 780.43. The Cboe UK 100 ended down 0.9% at 812.42, the Cboe UK 250 closed down 1.6% at 17,682.71, and the Cboe Small Companies fell 0.3% at 16,731.11. In European equities on Thursday, the CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX 40 in Frankfurt both plunged 2.0%. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.6% at the time of the London close. The S&P 500 traded flat, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3%. ‘A topsy-turvy set of events led to divergent fortunes on the US and UK markets. The Nasdaq pushed ahead, helped by strong showings from Tesla and Broadcom. At the same time, the FTSE 100 shuddered as investors voiced disappointment at the Fed’s commentary around interest rates last night,’ AJ Bell analyst Dan Coatsworth commented. ‘The prospect of Tesla investors approving a gargantuan pay deal for Elon Musk is in itself perplexing given the $56 billion amount, but for it to drive up the share price might also leave some people scratching their heads. The logical explanation is that it means Musk is no longer a flight risk, should the deal be approved. Pay him well and he’ll stay to oversee Tesla’s ongoing efforts to be crowned king of the electric vehicle sector. Broadcom has ’done an Nvidia’ with its latest results knocking it out of the park and announcing a 10-for-one stock split. With a share price approaching $1,700, the average person may not have the cash to buy a single share, so doing the stock split would effectively bring the price down in the region of $170 and put it in greater reach of more investors.’ Tesla shares were 3.9% higher, while Broadcom jumped 12%. After being boosted by a softer US inflation reading on Wednesday, beleaguered European stocks were sold off again on Thursday. Stocks on the continent have suffered selling pressure this week in the wake of the weekend’s European elections. Putting pressure on equities on Thursday, the Federal Reserve held rates and signalled just one cut before the end of the year, trimming its projection from three previously and offering a hawkish tilt to Wednesday’s decision. The central bank maintained the federal funds rate range at 5.25% to 5.50%, a 23-year high. The Fed’s latest economic projections, which includes the dot-plot of median interest rate expectations, suggests only one cut could be forthcoming before the end of 2024. The previous projection in March suggested three. Four members of the Federal Open Market Committee said they expected to make no cuts, while seven said they thought they would make one quarter-point cut. Eight of the 19 members backed two cuts. Analysts at Barclays commented: ‘As we had expected, the new summary of economic projections (was somewhat hawkish, showing a median of only one 25bp rate cut this year. This came despite a surprisingly weak May CPI inflation print. FOMC participants also lifted their longer​-​run dot to 2.75%. ‘We continue to think the cut could take place at the earliest in September. Our baseline is predicated on inflation gradually moderating in the coming months on a sequential basis and the economy gradually slowing. However, if inflation is stronger than in our baseline, we would expect the first rate cut to be postponed to December. We view this as almost as likely as our baseline scenario.’ The pound was quoted at $1.2764 latte on Thursday in London, lower compared to $1.2836 at the equities close on Wednesday. The euro stood at $1.0763, down against $1.0848. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥156.88, much higher compared to JP¥155.77. Focus turns to the Bank of Japan which announces an interest rate decision on Friday. Rabobank analysts commented: ‘The soft stance of the JPY suggests the market sees little scope for a hawkish surprise from the BoJ at tomorrow’s policy meeting. The market’s bearish outlook on the JPY is an ongoing problem for Japanese policy makers, though it may present an opportunity for Governor Ueda to attempt to wrongfoot the consensus.’ In London, shares in Halma jumped 13% as the safety equipment maker’s earnings impressed. Pretax profit jumped 17% to £340.3 million in the financial year ended March 31 from £291.5 million a year prior, as revenue climbed 9.8% to £2.03 billion from £1.85 billion. Halma recommended a final dividend of 13.20 pence per share, up 7.0% from 12.34p a year prior. This brings the total payout to 21.61p, up 7.0% from 20.20p. AJ Bell analyst Russ Mould commented: ‘The company’s focus on niche areas and providing technology-enabled health, safety and environmental solutions proved to be a winning formula yet again.’ Stocks exposed to interest rate worries struggled, however. Housebuilder Persimmon lost 3.8% and property investor Land Securities fell 3.2%. The duo were among the worst FTSE 100 performers. Wise plunged 11%. Disappointing guidance took the shine off a year of financial progress and customer gains. In the financial year ended March 31, the London-based money transfer services provider reported that revenue jumped 24% to £1.05 billion from £846.1 million a year earlier. Pretax profit rose to £481.4 million, more than triple £146.5 million a year prior. Underlying pretax profit rose to £241.8 million from £74.3 million. Looking ahead, Wise expects 15% to 20% annual underlying income growth for financial 2025, ‘driven by customer growth.’ Over the medium term, Wise expects to operate to an underlying pretax margin of 13% to 16%. Broker Jefferies said the 2025 guidance for underlying income was, at its mid-point, 2% below the consensus of £1.41 billion. Worse, Jefferies said the underlying pretax margin guidance implies pretax profit of £175 to £225 million, 19% below the consensus of £247 million. Brent oil was quoted at $82.53 a barrel late in London on Thursday, up from $82.07 late Wednesday. Gold was quoted at $2,307.79 an ounce, down against $2,326.83.

QUALITY COMPOUNDER Halma, which is often compared with US conglomerate  Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B:NYSE)  in terms of its diverse portfolio and hands-off management style, posted a 10% increase in revenue to just over £2 billion for the 12 months to March, driven by an 8% increase in underlying constant-currency sales. Adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) rose 12% to £424 million, helped by 7% underlying growth, lifting the margin on sales to 20.8% against 20.4% previously and above the firm’s target of a minimum 19% margin. Cash conversion increased from 78% to 103%, well ahead of Halma’s 90% target, reflecting good working capital control but also a reduction in inventory levels across the group’s companies after the strategic build-up post-Covid. On top of its organic growth, the firm made eight acquisitions last year comprising four standalone businesses and four bolt-ons and has spent more in the last two years than in the previous five years, which will drive even faster growth going forward even allowing for a couple of disposals.

Germany, however, will not follow France and hold a snap election despite the ruling coalition’s dismal performance in the EU election, a spokesman for Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Monday. XTB analyst Kathleen Brooks commented: ‘The outcome of the European elections have caused a ruction in European politics. ‘The question for traders of the euro and European stock markets is just how radical will Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella be if they do well in the French parliamentary elections? Their watchword is sovereignty, so what will this mean for relations with the EU and NATO? If the Rassemblement Party does well in the upcoming parliamentary elections, then it could take them a step closer to winning the Presidential elections in 2027. Combined with Georgia Meloni in Italy, the Far Right are making deep inroads into Europe’s top echelons of power. Brooks continued: ’Support for the German Chancellor has also slumped and Olaf Scholz‘s party has suffered a humiliating defeat... There could be questions asked around his leadership, and we could some political turmoil in Germany on the back of the EU vote, although we don’t think Germany will hold a snap election like France.‘ European banks ended lower on Monday. Societe Generale slumped 7.5%, BNP Paribas dropped 4.8% and Credit Agricole fell 3.6%. Against the euro, the pound rose as high as €1.1847 on Monday, its best level since August 2022. Versus the dollar, sterling was quoted at $1.2722 late on Monday afternoon in London, largely flat from $1.2724 at the equities close on Friday. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥156.89, up compared to JP¥156.82. Focus this week will be on the Federal Reserve decision on Wednesday. Analysts at ING commented: ’The US Fed accepts monetary policy is restrictive, but lingering inflation and strong jobs numbers mean it will indicate it’s prepared to wait longer before seriously considering interest rate cuts. The ’dot plot’ will be key. Having signalled three 25bp cuts in 2024 back in March, it could potentially go to just one; we’re expecting two.‘ Friday’s eagerly awaited US jobs report had showed the pace of hiring picked up by more than expected in May. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nonfarm payroll employment rose by 272,000 in May. This was ahead of a FXStreet consensus of 185,000 and higher than the average monthly gain of 232,000 over the prior 12 months. The March total was revised down by 5,000 to 310,000 from 315,000, while the total for April was revised down by 10,000 to 165,000 from 175,000. With these revisions, employment in April and March combined was 15,000 lower than previously reported. On AIM in London, Arecor Therapeutics dived 20% after it said it now expects to require new funding in the third quarter of this year. Arecor said its working capital requirements have accelerated primarily as a result of the timing of potential pipeline revenue and an increase in costs. The firm now expects funding to be required in the third quarter of 2024. Mkango Resources rose 23% after it launched a collaboration with Envipro Holdings on rare earth magnet recycling in Japan and the UK. The deal with Envipro, a Shizuoka, Japan-based recycling company, is via Mkango’s 79% owned subsidiary, HyProMag. The collaboration includes the joint marketing of HyProMag recycling technology solutions and recycled magnets in Japan and recycling trials to be carried out in UK and Japan on neodymium–iron–boron scrap supplied by Envipro. In addition, there will be analysis of the NdFeB scrap supply market and offtake opportunities in Japan plus collaboration on potential HyProMag recycling technology development in Japan.

Investors responded enthusiastically to the strategy reset, sending the shares up 280p or 11% to a new high for the year of £27.40. MORE FOCUSED APPROACH For the 12 months to the end of March, revenue was up 9.8% to £470 million, although taking into account currency movements the growth rate was just 5.8%, while adjusted operating profit was slightly lower at £80.3 million. That meant the operating margin slipped from 18.1% to 17.1%, while adjusted EPS fell 3.3% from 112.7p to 109p and cash conversion before investments dropped to 64% against 88% the previous year, which was nothing to shout about. However, as chief executive Richard Tyson explained, the firm had to ‘rebalance’ its geographic exposure by refocusing on non-sensitive areas in China following export licence refusals and increasing sales in Europe and other parts of Asia. On the plus side, underlying order growth remained robust, providing good visibility for the year ahead, but the real excitement centred on the firm’s plan to reorganise itself into two distinct businesses targeting fewer markets with a streamlined product portfolio to deliver ‘a step change in operational and service performance’ as Tyson put it. As part of the plan, the firm set out new medium-term   including organic top-line growth of between 5% and 8% per year, an increase in the operating margin to above 20%, cash conversion of over 85% and a ‘strong’ ROCE (return on capital employed), which is already close to 30%, together with a commitment to maintain R&D (research and development) spending at 8% to 9% of revenue. Separately, the company announced a small bolt-on  , buying Swiss precision instrument-maker FemtoTools for CHF 17 million (£14.9 million) plus a potential further payment of CHF 7 million (£6.1 million) dependent on the firm’s performance post-completion. EXPERT VIEW Shore Capital analysts Akhil Patel and Robin Speakman flagged Oxford Instruments’ strong order book for the current financial year, which they expect to underpin their earnings forecasts, as well as its strong cash position which gives it flexibility to make more bolt-on acquisitions to complement organic growth. ‘Oxford is materially more robust and profitable business than two years ago, with a credible strategy to improve EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) margins to an economically sustainable level of around 20% as minimum base over the medium term and a much stronger balance sheet. ‘We continue to believe its current valuation metrics still significantly fails to reflect Oxford as a higher quality business, its strategic progress and the significant operational improvement undertaken’, they concluded.

The ONS said average earnings excluding bonuses rose 6.0% on-year in the period, matching the pace of growth in the three months to April. Including bonuses, wages increased 5.9%, also matching the prior month, which was revised upwards from 5.7%. Market consensus had been anticipating a rise of just 5.7% in the recent period. Nicholas Hyett, investment manager at Wealth Club, commented: ‘Falling employment, rising unemployment and rising economic inactivity do not paint a pretty picture of the UK labour market. Falling vacancies makes those numbers particularly concerning, suggesting there is a genuine lack of demand for staff.’ Focus this week will be on the Federal Reserve decision on Wednesday. At the central bank’s fourth meeting of 2024, the Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged. The decision will be announced after the US May consumer price inflation data is out. Ipek Ozkardeskaya at Swissquote Bank said the Fed ‘is widely expected to trim its rate cutting projections for this year due to sticky inflation and still-tight jobs market.’ In the US on Monday, Wall Street ended higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.2%, the S&P 500 up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.4%.

Rio Tinto, Anglo American, Fresnillo, Glencore and Antofagasta were down 1.6%, 1.5%, 1.3%, 1.2%, and 1.1%. GSK rose 0.8%. GSK said it has taken the first step to seek appeal of the recent Daubert ruling, made by the Delaware Superior Court, which permits plaintiff expert testimony as part of the Zantac litigation in Delaware. ‘GSK strongly disagrees with the Delaware Superior Court’s ruling and has filed an application with the court to appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court for interlocutory review of the decision,’ it said. GSK claims that the court’s ruling is ‘inconsistent with how the Daubert standard has been applied previously in Delaware and federal courts.’ Zantac was a heartburn drug that was pulled off the market in 2020 at the request of the US Food & Drug Administration, after low levels of a ‘probable carcinogen’ were found in samples. In the FTSE 250, Oxford Instruments jumped 7.5%. In the year ended March 31, revenue rose 5.8% to £470.4 million from £444.7 million a year earlier. Pretax profit, however, edged down 3.0% to £71.3 million from £73.5 million. The company upped its dividend by 6.7% to 20.8p from 19.5p. Oxford Instruments also announced plans to acquire FemtoTools. Based in Zurich, Switzerland, and founded in 2007, FemtoTools specialises in the design and manufacture of high-speed, precision nanoindenters. Also in early company news, shares in Raspberry Pi Holdings rose as high as 388.20p. This is well above the 280p initial offering price disclosed by Raspberry Pi earlier Tuesday. At the IPO price, Raspberry Pi would have a market value of around £541.6 million, the company said in a statement. Tuesday’s share price rise implies a market value of around £751 million. CEO Eben Upton said: ‘The quality of the interactions during the marketing process has underlined our belief that London has the right calibre and sophistication of investor to support growing, ambitious technology businesses such as Raspberry Pi.

Shares in the group jumped as much as 68p or 15% to 482p shortly after the open and were still trading up nearly 50p or 12% by mid-morning. LAGGING BEHIND Rentokil has been struggling to improve its performance in the key US market, which makes up the bulk of its revenue. After reporting a strong full-year performance, boosting the shares in March, the firm’s first-quarter trading update in April did little to encourage sentiment. The business is seen falling further behind its US peer  Rollins (ROL:NYSE) , despite the 2022 acquisition of rival Terminix for an EV (enterprise value) of £4.5 billion, a deal which has so far failed to deliver the profit uplift investors were expecting. Now, according to  Bloomberg , activist investor Nelson Peltz has amassed a ‘significant’ stake in the company and has ‘reached out to discuss ideas and initiatives to improve shareholder value’. Without revealing the size of its stake, Peltz’s firm Trian Investors said it was a top 10 shareholder in Rentokil, although there has been no notification to the London Stock Exchange. The largest shareholders in Rentokil as it stands are UK investors Threadneedle,  Schroders  ( ) , Axa and Royal London, along with US institutions Capital, Fidelity, T. Rowe Price and Vanguard. One outlier on the list is Citigroup’s London global markets business which holds a 3.75% stake worth £450 million at today’s price, most likely for an outside investor such as Peltz rather than for its own account. WHAT CAN PELTZ DO? The news an activist is targeting a company means the business is underperforming to begin with, but with a group as big as Rentokil there would seem to be few easy fixes. Although total revenue has doubled in the last five years from £2.7 billion to £5.4 billion, thanks to the pandemic and the Terminix deal, reported earnings per share were  lower  last year than they were in 2019. In contrast, US firm Rollins increased its turnover from $2 billion to $3 billion in the same period and more than doubled its earnings from $0.41 to $0.89 per share. Looking back over more than 20 years, Rollins has compounded earnings at more than 13% per year with very little volatility, whereas Rentokil has barely grown its earnings at all over the same period, so the issues at the UK firm aren’t going to be solved overnight.

The company said it ‘strongly’ disagrees with the Delaware Superior Court ruling and has filed an application with the court of appeal to the Delaware Supreme court for review. GSK stated: ‘While reviews are granted in exceptional circumstances, GSK believes such circumstances are present here and that it is important to raise these matters now to the Delaware Supreme Court.’ Fellow defendants  Sanofi (SAN:EPA) ,  Pfizer (PFE:NYSE)  and Boehringer Ingelheim are all parties to the application, given their involvement in selling Zantac. GSK and Sanofi shares gained 1% on the news, while Pfizer shares ticked up 0.2% in pre-market trading in the US. FTSE 100 drugs giant GSK said a decision on the   would be expected sometime later this year. LITIGATION DISPROPORTIONATELY WEIGHING ON THE SHARES? So far, only one case has made it to trial and GSK was victorious after a Chicago court dismissed the plaintiff’s claim that Zantac had caused her colorectal cancer. Yesterday (10 June), GSK announced that a plaintiff dropped her case shortly before it was due to go to trial in Illinois state. The company said it did not settle with the plaintiff. Shore Capital’s healthcare analyst Sean Conroy argues that litigation has disproportionately weighed on the shares, noting recent settlements by Sanofi and Pfizer were made at the equivalent of $25,000 per claimant which is a ‘far cry’ from the $200,000 he estimates the market initially priced into the shares. ‘We still believe that a worst case, up to circa $30 billion downside scenario for litigation has been priced into the share. ‘We still view the current discount to peers as unwarranted and largely attributable to misguided assumptions around the potential cost of Zantac litigation’, concluded Conroy.

UK tech stories are few and far between in London, so investors will be hoping Raspberry Pi’s success can attract more tech sector peers to the market. Backed by strategic shareholders  Sony (6758:TYO)  and  Arm (ARM:NASDAQ) , Raspberry Pi is already profitable and believes it can sustain its strong growth trajectory in a TAM (total addressable market) worth some $21.2 billion (£16.7 billion). RIPE FOR GROWTH Founded by chief executive Eben Upton in 2012 to make computing more accessible to young people,   designs and develops low-cost SBCs (single board computers) and compute modules for industrial customers, enthusiasts and educators around the world. The Cambridge-headquartered company also entered the semiconductor market in early 2021 with the launch of its first semiconductor product, the RP2040 microcontroller. Raspberry Pi insists its computers are more efficient to manufacture and consume less energy than legacy desktop and embedded PCs. Since the company began trading in 2012, it has sold over 60 million SBCs and compute modules, 7.4 million of which were sold in the year to December 2023, when revenues ripened up 41% to $265.8 million. Pre-tax profit powered 90% higher to $38.2 million last year. However, the company has flagged volatility in customer demand in 2024-to-date, which has led to ‘higher than usual levels of inventory’, although management expects this to normalise over the course of 2024 ‘resulting in stronger results in the second half of the year than in the first half’. WHAT DID THE CEO SAY? Upton said: ‘The quality of the interactions during the marketing process has underlined our belief that London has the right calibre and sophistication of investor to support growing, ambitious technology businesses such as Raspberry Pi. The reaction that we have received is a reflection of the world-class team we have assembled and the strength of the loyal community with whom we have grown.’ He added: ‘Welcoming new shareholders alongside our existing ones brings with it a great responsibility, and one that we accept willingly, as we continue on our mission to make high-performance, low-cost computing accessible to everyone.’ The market newcomer is in fact a subsidiary of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, a UK charity whose goal is to promote interest in computer science among young people. Raspberry Pi has distributed approximately $50 million in dividends to the Foundation since 2013, which has been used to advance its educational mission globally. THE EXPERT’S VIEW Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said Raspberry Pi’s IPO shows the UK is open for business to technology flotations and investors are hungry for companies of any size if they tick the right boxes. ‘There is a widely held view that tech companies only float in the US where they can potentially get a higher valuation,’ explained Coatsworth. ‘Raspberry Pi is proof that the UK can still compete against the likes of the Nasdaq and attract home-grown champions. ‘Raspberry Pi is a profitable, established name and not reliant on the ‘jam tomorrow’ story that often props up a lot of tech IPOs. It has a large community of users; it makes money rather than simply being a bright idea that is not yet commercialised; and there is a strong social angle as Raspberry Pi has education built into its business model. ‘The UK market is woefully under-represented in tech names and hopefully Raspberry Pi’s IPO success will open the flood gates for others in the sector to also float here. If the London Stock Exchange wants a new posterchild for how IPOs should play out and to attract others onto the market, Raspberry Pi is the one to hold up high.’ DISCLAIMER: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in this article owns Shares magazine.

In European equities on Tuesday, the CAC 40 in Paris slumped 1.3%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt shed 0.7%. According to the Office for National Statistics, UK average earnings excluding bonuses rose 6.0% on-year in the period, matching the pace of growth in the three months to April. Including bonuses, wages increased 5.9%, also matching the prior month, which was revised upwards from 5.7%. Market consensus had been anticipating a rise of just 5.7% in the recent period. The report from the ONS showed the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4% in the three months to April from 4.3% in the three months to March. According to FXStreet, markets were expecting the unemployment rate to remain unchanged. The wage growth figure is ‘well above the levels that would make the Bank of England have any real confidence in achieving its 2% inflation target’, Ebury analyst Matthew Ryan commented. ‘The rest of the data was, however, patently consistent with a cooling in labour market conditions. Unemployment is rising, albeit gradually, and is now at its highest level since September 2021. Sterling largely held its own off the back of the data, as while rapidly rising wages could delay the start to Bank of England interest rate cuts, the increase in joblessness bodes ill for the UK’s growth outlook.’ The pound was quoted at $1.2722 in London on Tuesday, unmoved from the equities close on Monday. The euro stood at $1.0727, down against $1.0739. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥157.26, higher compared to JP¥156.89. French banking stocks were lower again. Societe Generale, among the worst of the lot in the CAC 40 in Paris, slumped 4.8%. Ratings agency Moody’s has warned that the snap elections called by President Emmanuel Macron could lower France’s credit score because it raises the risk of ‘political instability’. Macron decided to dissolve the National Assembly and hold legislative elections after the far-right triumphed over his centrist group in Sunday’s European Parliament elections. The first round will take place on June 30 and the run-off on July 7. ‘This snap election increases the risks to fiscal consolidation’ and is ‘credit negative’ for its rating, Moody’s said in a statement late on Monday. Eyes were also on Westminster, as the UK general election campaign continues. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has pledged a tax break for landlords and help for first-time buyers as he prepares to launch the Conservative Party manifesto. The UK prime minister’s offer will include a 100% relief on capital gains tax liability for landlords who sell to their existing tenants, claiming the move will be ‘transformational’. Sunak, who acknowledged during a BBC interview that it has become harder for people to own their first home under the Conservatives, will also pledge to abolish stamp duty up to the value of £425,000 for first-time buyers and launch a ‘new and improved’ Help to Buy scheme. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.6% at the time of the European equities close. The S&P 500 was down 0.2%, though the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%. The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain interest rates at the current level once again, and the focus Wednesday will be on what it reveals in its latest projections, with the prospect of a hat-trick of cuts this year all but over. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, there is a 99% chance the Fed maintains the federal funds rate range at 5.25%-5.50%. It will be the seventh successive hold by the US central bank. Potentially muddying the waters, policymakers will have a US inflation reading to digest just hours before the decision. According to FXStreet, the annual rate of consumer price inflation is expected to have remained unmoved at 3.4% in May, where it stood in April. The annual rate of core inflation is expected to have ebbed to 3.5% from 3.6%. ACY Securities analyst Luca Santos commented: ‘Attention will be on the Fed’s forward guidance and the dot plot, which shows future rate expectations. There is speculation about an upward revision in the 2024 median forecast, suggesting the possibility of two rate cuts by the end of the year, instead of the previously projected three, along with an upward skew in individual rate projections. The CPI report will be pivotal in shaping the Fed’s perspective. Current projections indicate a favourable trend, with inflation expected to decelerate.’ In London, Oxford Instruments rose 7.1%. The Abingdon, England-based company is a provider of technology products and services for industrial companies and research communities. In the year ended March 31, statutory pretax profit decreased 3.0% to £71.3 million from £73.5 million the year prior. Revenue rose 5.8% to £470.4 million from £444.7 million over the same period. Oxford Instruments announced a final dividend of 15.90 pence per share, up 6.7% from 14.90 pence. This brings the total dividend paid in the year to 20.80p, reflecting a 6.7% increase from 19.50p. Capricorn Energy added 8.8%. The oil and gas exploration company confirmed that first production from the Sangomar Field development offshore Senegal has commenced. It said that it has received confirmation from Woodside that the first oil condition under the sale and purchase agreement has been satisfied. On AIM, Deltic Energy slumped 18%. The natural resources investor has withdrawn from the Pensacola discovery in the UK North Sea. Deltic said: ‘Despite an exhaustive process, deteriorating sentiment towards the oil and gas industry as a result of ongoing fiscal volatility and negative political rhetoric in the run-up to the July election have resulted in Deltic being unable to secure a farm-out or an alternative funding solution which would allow the company to commit to its future commitments with respect to the Pensacola appraisal well.’ Deltic said the only appropriate course of action is to withdraw from the licence ‘prior to further liabilities being crystallised’. Brent oil was quoted at $81.74 a barrel at in London late on Tuesday afternoon, higher from $80.81 late Monday. Gold was quoted at $2,312.47 an ounce, up against $2,305.10. Wednesday’s economic calendar has a slew of inflation readings, including China overnight, Germany at 0700 BST and the US at 1330 BST. The economic diary, which also has UK gross domestic product at 0700 BST, culminates with the latest Fed decision at 1900 BST. Copyright 2024 Alliance News Ltd. All Rights Reserved.

However, shareholders appear to be unnerved by some of the detail as the stock price declined 8p or 4.7% to 162.4p taking it to the bottom of the FTSE 250 leader board. CURRENCY HEADWINDS The firm reported positive trading momentum had continued throughout the first half with revenue up 8.6% on a constant-currency basis and pre-tax profit up 13.6% on the same basis. However, adjusted for currency movements, in particular the Japanese yen which dropped 15% against the pound during the period, revenue growth was only 4.6% and profit before tax registered a 10.3% increase. Photobooths showed a steady performance during the half, with revenue up 7.4% (but just 2.3% on an adjusted basis) driven by demand for official photo ID and the integration of more than 3,500 booths previously acquired in Japan. The Wash.Me laundry machine business was once again the fastest-growing area with underlying revenue up 19.6% (17.4% on a currency-adjusted basis) as the number of Revolution machines in operation grew 18% on the previous year. The group   to roll out its machines in high-footfall locations such as supermarkets and petrol forecourts, and its pipeline suggests it will deploy a record number of machines this financial year. EXPERT VIEW Analyst Eleanor Spencer at Berenberg argues investors should focus on the double-digit growth in underlying and adjusted pre-tax earnings and the roll-out of Revolution laundry machines, which is accelerating. While laundry machine revenue grew 17% in the first half, Spencer believes based on a pick-up in second-half instalments sales at the Wash.Me division could increase by 25% or more in the six months to August taking the full-year increase to 21% or thereabouts. Spencer calls the current valuation of the shares ‘appetising’ and says while further currency movements ‘may pose a risk to headline sales growth, ME Group's improving business mix - driven by Wash.ME - and the strong underlying growth rates across both divisions offer confidence it will hit its before-tax profit expectations’.

The FTSE 100 index opened up 55.24 points, 0.7%, at 8,203.05. The FTSE 250 was up 84.20 points, 0.4%, at 20,351.05, and the AIM All-Share was up 2.37 points, 0.3%, at 783.88.

In European equities on Wednesday, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.4%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was up 0.7%. The UK economy stalled in April, in line with market expectations, according to data from the Office for National Statistics on Wednesday. UK gross domestic product was flat in April from March, in line with FXStreet-cited market consensus. In March from February, GDP had increased by 0.4%, according to revised data from the ONS. “The market had low expectations for the UK economy in April, and it duly delivered,‘ said Nicholas Hyett, investment manager at Wealth Club. ‘Economic growth was flat, held back by a third month in a row of contraction in the construction industry and weakness in the manufacturing sector.’ There was also some bad news for the UK industrial sector. The ONS reported that industrial production fell by 0.9% on-month in April, worse than expectations of a 0.1% fall. Production had risen by 0.2% in March from February. On an annual basis, industrial production fell by 0.4% in April, having risen by 0.5% the month earlier. Investors do not have long to dwell on the UK data, though, with attention quickly turning to the latest US Federal Reserve interest rate decision, and inflation data. The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain interest rates at the current level once again, and the focus Wednesday will be on what it reveals in its latest projections, with the prospect of a hat-trick of cuts this year all but over.

According to FXStreet, the annual rate of consumer price inflation is expected to have remained unmoved at 3.4% in May, where it stood in April. The annual rate of core inflation is expected to have ebbed to 3.5% from 3.6%. ‘These numbers are nowhere near the Fed‘s 2% target and are not trending sufficiently fast toward that level, but a surprise to the downside could fuel the Fed cut bets for later this year,’ said Ipek Ozkardeskaya at Swissquote Bank. The pound was quoted at $1.2748 early on Wednesday in London, higher compared to $1.2722 at the equities close on Tuesday. The euro stood at $1.0745, higher against $1.0727.

Bloomberg reported that Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management has amassed a significant stake in the pest control and hygiene firm. The investor is now a top 10 stakeholder in Rentokil. On the other hand, Legal & General lost 3.3%. Legal & General announced a £200 million share buyback, in its ‘first step of plan to increase returns to shareholders.’ It explained that it plans to return more to shareholders over 2024 to 2027, through a combination of dividends and buybacks. The company eyes 2% dividend per share growth each year and ‘further similar buybacks.’ In the FTSE 250, Molten Ventures jumped 11%. The venture capital firm reported that its pretax loss narrowed to £49.8 million in the year ended March 31 from £246.7 million a year earlier. ‘This has been a productive year for Molten. We’ve continued to enhance our innovative platform to capture the exceptional investment opportunities available in backing high growth, disruptive, UK and European technology firms. The underlying performance of our portfolio companies remain strong, with valuations continuing to stabilise as the macroeconomic environment shows signs of improvement,’ said CEO Martin Davis. Safestore lost 2.4%. The Hertfordshire, England-based self-storage provider reported that in the six months ended April 30, revenue fell 0.8% to £109.2 million from £110.1 million a year earlier. Pretax profit climbed 68% to £173.7 million from £103.4 million. Safestore upped its interim dividend by 1.0% to 10.0p from 9.9p. In other company news, Special Opportunities REIT said it had to cancel its planned initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange. The real estate investment trust said that despite ‘strong’ investor demand, it failed to meet the £250 million minimum fundraise required for the IPO to proceed. On May 29, the company had said it targeted a fundraise of £500 million, which would have been London’s biggest IPO so far in 2024. ‘The management team will now acquire assets from the pipeline using private capital in line with the company’s proposed strategy,’ Special Opportunities said.

The FTSE 100 index was down 23.67 points, 0.3%, at 8,221.70. The FTSE 250 was down 66.99 points, 0.3%, at 20,488.38, and the AIM All-Share was down 4.26 points, 0.5%, at 789.27.

In European equities on Monday, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 2.0%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was down 0.8%. Over the week, the EU election has shaken up politics. It has seen French President Macron calling a snap election, amid the rise of right wing parties in Europe. The election will be held in the next 30 days. ‘This injects a big dose of the uncertainty which markets hate – with the euro dropping sharply in response to the developments,’ said AJ Bell’s Russ Mould. The euro stood at $1.0736 at midday on Monday, down against $1.0812 at the equities close on Friday.

The Fed will announce its latest interest rate decision on Wednesday this week. At the central bank’s fourth meeting of 2024, the Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged. The decision will be announced after the US May consumer price inflation data is out. According to FXStreet CPI is expected to stick at 3.4% in May, the same level recorded in April. It remains above the Fed’s 2% target.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was called down 0.3%, the S&P 500 index down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.1%. With the political turmoil in Europe and nerves ahead of the Fed’s interest rate decision, only a handful of companies were in the green on the FTSE 100. Notably, M&G rose 2.3% to the top of the index. M&G said it will take a series of actions to reduce debt by up to £450 million, including buying back bonds and not replacing them. The London-based investment manager said the action plan was part of its commitment to reduce its Solvency II leverage ratio to 30% or less by 2025. M&G said it will redeem its £300 million in 3.875% resettable dated Tier 2 notes in full next month and not replace these. It also will make tender offers for up to £150 million in its four other Tier 2 notes. Ashtead Group lost 0.7%. On Saturday, the Telegraph reported that Ashtead is eyeing a move across the pond, in what would be a fresh blow to the London Stock Exchange.

Amongst London’s small-caps, Gulf Marine Services rose 4.5%. Gulf Marine said it has signed the second phase of four-year contract announced in March. The contract with an unnamed customer is for one of GMS’s vessels operating in the Middle East. On AIM, Arecor Therapeutics dived 22%, after it said it now expects to require new funding in the third quarter of this year.

The shares gained 2% in pre-market trading and have more than doubled since the middle of December 2023 driven by a string of positive news from its pipeline of new drugs. It is the first time final phase-three data has been released by a company developing a combined vaccine. Other companies in the race include French pharmaceutical firm  Sanofi (SAN:EPA)  and US biotechnology company  Novavax (NVAX)  which announced (10 May) a co-exclusive marketing agreement to develop novel combined vaccines. Should Moderna’s drug gain approval it could be available in the UK as it is rolled-out to the NHS. Moderna’s  Spikevax  vaccine for Covid-19 is being used as part of the NHS booster programmes alongside  Pfizer’s (PFE:NYSE)   Comirnaty. IMPROVED CONVENIENCE AND COMPLIANCE Moderna chief executive Stephane Bancel said: ‘Combination vaccines have the potential to reduce the burden of respiratory viruses on health systems and pharmacies, as well as offer people more convenient vaccination options that could improve compliance and provide stronger protection from seasonal illnesses. ‘Moderna is the only company with a positive phase three flu and Covid combination vaccine.’ Data from the trial comprising around 4,000 patients showed m-RNA 1083 met its goals and led to higher immune responses against flu and Covid-19 than two other single vaccines including  Spikevax . The trial targeted a group over the age of 65 for the flu vaccine and a group aged between 50 and 64 for the Covid-19 vaccine. Moderna has been building out a portfolio of vaccines based on the mRNA technology behind its successful Covid-19 vaccine to combat falling sales as the disease becomes a seasonal affliction. In May, Moderna received US approval for its RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) to protect adults aged 60 and over. The virus causes cold-like symptoms and is a leading cause of pneumonia in babies and older adults, leading to 177,000 hospitalisations and 14,000 deaths in the US annually. In February, the company’s m-RNA skin cancer vaccine being developed in collaboration with  Merck (MRK:NYSE)  was given breakthrough therapy designation  by the regulator. This approval is designed to accelerate the development and review of potential new medicines for serious conditions that address an unmet need. You can opt out at any time."}
