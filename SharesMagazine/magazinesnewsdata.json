The FTSE 100 index closed up 3.94 points at 8,424.20. The FTSE 250 ended up 123.43 points, 0.6%, at 20,873.33, and the AIM All-Share closed up 15.92 points, 2.0%, at 809.94. The Cboe UK 100 ended up 0.1% at 840.87, the Cboe UK 250 closed up 0.6% at 18,250.48, and the Cboe Small Companies ended up 0.8% at 16,532.02. In European equities on Monday, the CAC 40 in Paris ended up 0.4%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt ended up 0.3%. Investors this week are eyeing Wednesday’s inflation reading for the UK. It is expected to show that the rate of consumer price inflation moderated markedly to 2.1% in April, from 3.2% in March, according to FXStreet cited consensus. If the reading comes in line with expectations, hopes for an interest rate cut from the Bank of England will climb. Last week there was some good news from the US in terms of cooling inflation. Swissquote Bank analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya commented: ‘Equity bulls around the globe celebrated in style the softer-than-expected US CPI data last week. The global equity rally was further juiced by the expectation that a softer inflation in the US would not only allow the Federal Reserve to start cutting the rates this year, but also allow the other major central banks, like the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, to carry on with their plans to cut their own rates and – maybe – cut more than people think they could.’ Hopes of an interest rate cut have prompted the price of gold higher, with the precious metal hitting a record high above $2,450 an ounce earlier Monday. Gold was quoted at $2,423.50 an ounce at the London equities close Monday, up against $2,407.63 at the close on Friday. Higher gold prices pushed gold miner Fresnillo up 4.0% to the top of the FTSE 100 index. The pound was quoted at $1.2702 at the London equities close Monday, higher compared to $1.2696 at the close on Friday. The euro stood at $1.0862 at the European equities close Monday, lower against $1.0866 at the same time on Friday. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥156.14, higher compared to JP¥155.53 late Friday. In the FTSE 100, Airtel Africa rose 2.2%. The Africa-focused telecommunications firm confirmed that its subsidiary Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) BV has fully repaid a $550 million bond in 5.35% guaranteed senior notes maturing on Monday. In the FTSE 250 index, Kainos rose 17%. The London-based IT service company said in the year ended March 31, statutory pretax profit rose 19% to £64.8 million from £54.3 million the year prior. Revenue increased 2.0% to £382.4 million from £374.8 million. Kainos declared a final dividend of 19.1 pence per share, up 19% from 16.1p. Therefore, the total dividend paid for the year stands at 27.3p, up 14% from 23.9p. Chief Executive Officer Russell Sloan commented: ‘Our latest results, record our 14th consecutive year of growth with disciplined execution in the current macro-economic climate. On London’s AIM, ValiRx shot up 23%. ValiRx noted that the peptide nanoparticle formation Cytolytix received a Knowledge Transfer Voucher grant in conjunction with The Open University. Cytolytix Ltd is a partially-owned ValiRx subsidiary established to progress CLX001. The life sciences company focused on early-stage cancer therapeutics and women’s health highlighted that the assessment of formulation options for the triple negative breast cancer project CLX001 has progressed during the first quarter of 2024. On the other hand, Haydale Graphene Industries closed down 11%. The Carmarthenshire, Wales-based technology solutions company warned sales and earnings would miss City forecasts as an upturn in orders in the US was taking longer than hoped to materialise. In a trading update for the year ending June, Haydale said it expects full-year sales of £4.7 million behind current market forecasts of £5.8 million. This would still be above last year’s £4.3 million, Haydale said. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation is expected to only be ’marginally behind‘ market expectations, at a £3.2 million compared to forecasts for a £3.0 million loss. Stocks in New York were higher at the London equities close, with the DJIA up 0.2%, the S&P 500 index up 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.7%. Brent oil was quoted at $83.65 a barrel at the London equities close Monday, up from $83.61 late Friday.

The reason for the modest upwards price pressure was due to the spring selling season, said Rightmove, adding ‘May is typically a strong month for price growth, with new price records having been set in May in 12 of the previous 22 years.’ TOP OF THE LADDER The top-of-the-ladder sector is still leading price growth, with average prices up by 1.3% compared with last year. The number of sales being agreed during the first four months of the year is 17% higher than last year, outstripping the 12% increase in the number of new sellers coming to the market. The news sent shares in selected house builders higher in morning trading including  Bellway  ( ) , with  Barratt Developments  ( )   up nearly 1% to 528p, and  Persimmon  ( )  up over 1% to £14.88. EXPERT VIEW Daniel Austin, CEO at specialist property lender ASK Partners, said: ‘The property sector is recovering. Rent values have seen sustained growth, positioning real estate as reasonably valued in comparison to gilts and presenting growth potential. ‘In the realm of commercial real estate, factors like physical condition, location, and age significantly influence a property's value. Well-maintained properties boasting modern amenities tend to command higher prices, while neglected ones may struggle to attract tenants or investors. ‘In the current market, the emphasis has shifted towards the importance of location and quality over the yield on debt or cost. We anticipate opportunistic acquisitions of prime properties in prime locations.’ ‘A (Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors) RICS survey uncovered that non-traditional market segments, such as aged care facilities, student housing, data centres and life sciences real estate are yielding the most robust returns.’ You can opt out at any time."},
{"source_name": "SharesMagazine", "title": "Cooling inflation, record breaking markets and short-lived meme 2.0 | Wall Street Week", "published_date": "17 May 2024, 10:30", "title_link": "https://www.sharesmagazine.co.uk/news/shares/cooling-inflation-record-breaking-markets-and-short-lived-meme-20-wall-street-week", "Description": "Wall Street spirits have been higher over the past week than a couple of college dropouts, with all three major indexes ripping up the record books, including the S&P 500 closing above 5,300 (15 May) for the first time. Cooler-than-expected inflation in April sets the scene for a potential Fed rate cut soon despite a string of hot inflation reports from the first three months of the year. Like a toddler on a carpet, the economy may still be capable of a soft landing, markets seem to think. Core CPI, which tracks the price of goods and services excluding volatile food and energy prices and is closely watched as an inflation indicator, rose 3.6% from the same period last year. That’s the smallest annual increase since April 2021. You can judge the relative euphoria levels by Meme stock 2.0 emerging over the past week, albeit a seemingly short-lived one. Popular names like  AMC Entertainment (AMC:NYSE) ,  GameStop (GME:NYSE)  and  Blackberry (BB:NYSE)  jumped anywhere from 12% to 60% in pre-market trading this week, although they held on to almost none of those gains as the dust settled. It seems that block trades were light and small share orders dominated, which tells us that this was a retail investor frenzy largely ignored by big institutions, although it has presumably led to some embarrassing short covering by some hedge funds. There was also some interesting earnings from IT kit bellwether  Cisco Systems (CSCO:NASDAQ)  for investors to chew over, and  Shares  take can be read here. CHUBB We got a great example of Warren Buffett’s power to drive share prices over the past week after the ‘Sage of Omaha’ revealed that US insurer  Chubb (CB:NYSE)  was the new stock his  Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)  firm has been stakebuilding in recently. Chubb shares jumped to a new $264.88 all-time high after regulatory filings showed Buffett has amassed a $6.7 billion stake. Berkshire started purchasing shares in Chubb in the third quarter of 2023 and received permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission to temporarily keep the purchases under its hat until it had finished buying to prevent other investors piggybacking off the idea. The purchase comes shortly after the Berkshire annual shareholder meeting (4 May) where chairman Buffett told investors he had trimmed its stake in  Apple (APPL:NASDAQ)  to around $135 billion triggering an $11.2 billion after tax gain. Buffett also revealed the company’s cash pile reached a record $190 billion at the end of the first quarter reflecting a dearth of worthwhile investment opportunities. In that context the Chubb purchase is noteworthy, and it becomes one of Berkshire’s top 10 holdings adding to its burgeoning insurance interests. Last month (23 April) Chubb reported a 14% rise in first quarter net written premiums and a 22% increase in core operating income. [MG] WALMART Also breaking share price records was  Walmart (WMT:NYSE) , closing at $64.01 after first quarter figures from the world’s biggest retailer beat on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue of $161.5 billion for the quarter ended 30 April was up 6% year-on-year and exceeded the $159.5 billion Wall Street scribes were looking for, while adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 came in above the $0.52 consensus estimate. The Arkanas-based chain called out gains with high-income shoppers, who are flocking to Walmart for its convenience, as well as same-store sales growth of 3.8% for its US business, which also generated e-commerce growth of 22%, where it is neatly using its spread of stores to meet quick delivery targets. The big-box retailer and US economic bellwether also highlighted progress with newer revenue streams, such as advertising and its subscription-based membership programme. Walmart said now expects to deliver full-year results at the high end or slightly above previous guidance of 3% to 4% sales growth with 4% to 6% operating income growth. [JC] SUPER MICRO COMPUTER Ever popular AI (artificial intelligence) play  Super Micro Computer (SMCI:NASDAQ)  scorched 15% higher during the past week, a massive jump considering there was no company-specific news. Analysts reckon positive backcloth sounds being made by the likes of  Dell Technologies (DELL:NYSE)  plus the buzz created by back-to-back AI product events from OpenAI and  Alphabet (GOOG:NASDAQ)  led to levels barely short of euphoric, and sentiment is a great driver of share prices. It shows that when investors feel in a good mood, share prices can run higher for longer than you might otherwise expect. Remember, this just a couple of weeks after Super Micro’s stock tanked after missing quarterly revenue forecasts. Since then (30 Apr), Super Micro stock has surged more than 22%.

The FTSE 100 index opened up 21.60 points, 0.3%, at 8,441.86. The FTSE 250 was up 84.15 points, 0.4%, at 20,834.05. The AIM All-Share surged 13.56 points, 1.7%, at 807.58, getting a boost from possible M&A at Keywords Studios, one of the junior market’s largest constituents. The Cboe UK 100 was up 0.3% at 842.52, the Cboe UK 250 was also up 0.3%, trading at 18,202.10, and the Cboe Small Companies was up 0.2% at 16,439.74. In European equities on Monday, the CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX 40 in Frankfurt were each up 0.2%. The pound was quoted at $1.2697 early Monday in London, barely budging from $1.2696 at the time of the local equities close on Friday. The euro stood at $1.0874, up from $1.0866. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥155.61, up from JP¥155.53. ‘USD is starting the week on the backfoot against most major currencies on narrower bond yield spreads between the US and other major economies. Fed funds future pricing for a first rate cut in September (80% discounted) is also curtailing USD strength and supporting risk assets. Stocks in Asia and US equity futures are up,’ Brown Brothers Harriman analysts commented. ‘There are no major US economic data releases this week can could trigger a delay in expectations for Fed easing. Instead, the global May PMI readings Thursday will help determine if economic growth momentum is indeed shifting from the US towards other major economies.’ Lloyds Bank said that while US data ‘dominated’ last week, this week it is the turn of UK economic reports. ‘The highlight will probably be Wednesday’s inflation report. That is set to show a big fall in annual headline CPI inflation, but we do expect it to remain slightly above the 2.0% target. Core inflation is also expected to be down but still well above the headline rate,’ Lloyds analysts commented. ‘It is also a big week for UK activity numbers including PMI data, retail sales and the GfK consumer confidence numbers. In contrast to the US, recent UK data have surprised on the upside, including a stronger than expected Q1 GDP outturn. A big question is whether the pace of growth will moderate in Q2.’ The latest UK consumer price index reading is released Wednesday. It is expected to show that the rate of consumer price inflation moderated markedly to 2.1% in April, from 3.2% in March, according to FXStreet cited consensus. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 closed up 0.7%, while the S&P/ASX 200 in Sydney added 0.6%. In China, the Shanghai Composite was up 0.5% in afternoon dealings, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was up 0.2%. China’s central bank left key interest rates unchanged at its May meeting, as expected. The People’s Bank of China left the one-year loan prime rate - which serves as the benchmark for corporate loans - unchanged at 3.45%. The five-year LPR - which is used to price mortgages - was left at 3.95%. It had been cut from 4.20% in February, in an effort to stimulate the country’s flagging housing market. A top Chinese economic official had said Friday the state could buy up commercial real estate in a bid to boost the country’s ailing housing market, currently battling an unprecedented debt crisis. Property and construction accounts for more than a quarter of gross domestic product, but the sector has been under unprecedented strain since 2020, when authorities tightened developers’ access to credit in a bid to reduce mounting debt. And in a bid to boost the ailing market and ensure millions of unused homes go to those in need of housing, Beijing’s State Council met Friday, state news agency Xinhua said. ‘Great efforts should be made to promote the handling of commercial housing projects classified as under construction that have been sold and are facing difficulties to deliver,’ Vice Premier He Lifeng told the meeting, according to state media. Gold was quoted at $2,437.44 an ounce early Monday, rising from $2,407.63 late Friday. The precious metal hit a record high above $2,450 an ounce earlier Monday, on hope that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates this year. Gold’s price surge helped Fresnillo surge 3.7%. The gold miner was the best large-cap performer early Monday. Keywords Studios was the star performer in the wider London market, however, jumping 62%. It said it would be ‘minded to recommend’ a possible offer from EQT Group, following a series of bids from the private equity firm. The AIM-listed provider of technical and creative services for video game production said the latest cash approach of 2,550p per share is a ‘significant increase from the initial proposal’. It values all of Dublin-based Keywords at around £2.03 billion. The proposed bid price is a chunky 73% premium to the firm’s closing price of 1,470p on Friday. Keywords said the latest approach follows ‘four previous unsolicited proposals from EQT in recent months’. Kainos also climbed, adding 10%. It reported annual earnings growth and lifted its dividend, and also announced a new chair. Independent Non-Executive Director Rosaleen Blair will replace outgoing Tom Burnet as chair. Burnet steps down following the IT provider’s annual general meeting on September 24. Kainos, a partner of enterprise software provider Workday, said revenue in the year to March 31 rose 2.0% to £382.4 million from £374.8 million. Pretax profit climbed 19% to £64.8 million from £54.3 million. Kainos upped its final dividend by 19% to 19.1 pence per share from 16.1p a year prior. Its total dividend amounted to 27.3p, a rise from 23.9p. ‘Our latest results, record our 14th consecutive year of growth with disciplined execution in the current macro-economic climate,’ Chief Executive Officer Russell Sloan said. ‘Despite the ongoing global economic uncertainty, we believe that our largest business areas, Workday Products, Workday Services and the public sector segment of Digital Services, will continue to be resilient and will offer substantial growth opportunities in both the near term and medium term. We are well positioned within these markets, both locally and, increasingly, internationally, and we remain confident in our strategy.’ Brent oil was quoted at $84.20 a barrel on Monday morning in London, rising from $83.61 late Friday afternoon.

Shares in Victorian Plumbing rose 5.6% to 90.2p on news of the deal, funded from the company’s existing cash reserves and representing ‘another exciting strategic milestone’ for the online baths-to-basins seller according to chief executive Mark Radcliffe. TAPPING INTO GROWTH Skelmersdale-headquartered Victorian Plumbing, whose earnings upgrade potential and income credentials  Shares  highlighted in February, has snapped up   for £22.5 million. The purchase price represents 0.5 times Victoria Plum’s estimated annual sales and reflects the ‘significant strategic value’ of the Victoria Plum brand and intellectual property to the acquirer. Liberum Capital said the acquisition highlights ‘the strength of the Victorian Plumbing business, its brand and further entrenchment of its competitive advantages’. The broker believes the acquisition should be ‘materially earnings enhancing’ for the online bathroom specialist, once Victorian Plumbing captures synergies from a deal that should drive future upgrades. IN REPAIR MODE Doncaster-based Victoria Plum was once Victorian Plumbing’s closest online competitor, generating sales of roughly £150 million at peak. But revenues have fallen away to around £40 million and the business is only six months out of administration. Since Victoria Plum remains in repair mode, it will continue to be traded separately pending finalisation of an integration plan. But with a cost-cutting programme in progress, Victorian Plumbing expects the acquired etailer to ‘broadly break even’ in the second half of 2024 and stressed the brand continues to boast high awareness. WHAT DID THE CEO SAY? Radcliffe commented: ‘I am delighted to announce the acquisition of Victoria Plum, a well-established brand with a solid base of customers, suppliers and product ranges. The acquisition aligns with our ambitions to accelerate our growth.’ He added: ‘This acquisition represents another exciting strategic milestone for the company and, together with the investment in our new distribution centre, provides a unique opportunity to deliver increased shareholder return.’ The opening of its new automated distribution centre in Lancashire is a key upcoming catalyst for Victorian Plumbing which should accelerate growth and boost margins. This state-of-the-art warehouse will provide capacity to double sales to around £600 million, take on more stock within the core bathroom category and allow Victorian Plumbing to scale in the growth categories of lighting, flooring, tiles and trade, which could more than double its UK total addressable market to over £3.5 billion.

Amongst individual stocks, gold miner Fresnillo was the top performer of the morning on the FTSE 100 index, climbing with hopes of interest rate cuts. In the FTSE 250 index, Kainos jumped thanks to an increase in its dividend and a strong set of results. The FTSE 100 index was up 22.82 points, 0.3%, at 8,443.08. The FTSE 250 was up 146.76 points, 0.7%, at 20,896.66, and the AIM All-Share was up 15.69 points, 2.0%, at 809.71.

That gave a lift to mining stocks in London, though the FTSE 100 still ended lower, making a weekly loss. The FTSE 100 index ended down 18.39 points, 0.2%, at 8,420.26. The FTSE 250 closed down 72.94 points, 0.4%, at 20,749.90, and the AIM All-Share rose 1.52 points, 0.2%, at 794.02.

In European equities on Friday, the CAC 40 in Paris closed down 0.3%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt ended down 0.2%. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were all marginally lower. ‘After notching up new record intraday highs yesterday, US markets ran out of steam towards the end of the session and left Wall Street limping towards the finish line,’ AJ Bell analyst Russ Mould commented. ‘A sea of red at the market close left US markets below where they started and that negativity set the tone for European markets on Friday.’ The pound was quoted at $1.2696 late on Friday afternoon in London, higher compared to $1.2671 at the equities close on Thursday. The euro stood at $1.0866, down slightly against $1.0870. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥155.53, higher compared to JP¥155.26. Analysts at ING commented: ‘In the two weeks leading to the 31 May US core [personal consumption expenditures] release, markets may experience reduced volatility. This is not necessarily bad news for the high-yielding USD.’ ING believes the pound may struggle, seeing ‘risks skewed to the dovish side for the Bank of England’. ‘We continue to like the chances of a move higher in EUR/GBP as markets may increase their bets on a June rate cut,’ ING analysts said. Megan Greene, who joined the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee last July, said Thursday she has noticed that ‘inflation persistence has waned’ since her arrival. ‘This is no mere coincidence - it has faded in part because of our restrictive stance of policy,’ Greene said. ‘I think there remains more uncertainty about how much inflation persistence indeed persists than there is about how our monetary policy stance is weighing on growth. In considering for how long we must retain our restrictive stance before policy should be eased, I think the burden of proof therefore needs to lie in inflation persistence continuing to wane.’ In London, shares in gold miners ended in the green, tracking bullion prices higher. Fresnillo rose 3.4%, while Hochschild Mining climbed 5.7%. Gold was quoted at $2,407.63 an ounce late Friday, higher against $2,381.33 on Thursday. Antofagasta added 3.6%, as copper also climbed. Rio Tinto rose 2.4% and Glencore grew 0.7% in what was a strong day for miners. Brent oil was quoted at $83.61 a barrel late in London on Friday, up from $83.05 late Thursday. ‘The biggest question mark for oil traders, and potentially the main price driver in the medium term, rests on demand forecasts. US inventories came up shorter than predicted, raising hopes of greater crude demand, but the upside created by this news was capped by uncertainty over the Chinese economy. Such doubts grew after the imposition of fresh US import tariffs on Chinese goods, feeding apprehension over demand from the world’s leading crude importer. Against this background, the price of Brent looks set to remain firmly supported above the $80 per barrel level and face resistance at $84,’ ActivTrades analyst Ricardo Evangelista commented. Back in London, Land Securities fell 2.6%. The London-based company suggested commercial property prices have begun to stabilise as investor interest picks up, given the more ‘balanced’ outlook for interest rates. Chief Executive Mark Allan said: ‘Following a reset of values over the past two years driven by rising interest rates, the stabilisation in rates and evidence of continued rental growth is starting to attract increased investor interest for the best assets.’ ‘Around 60% of our portfolio already showed stable values in the second half and overall yields were largely stable in the final quarter, pointing to a positive outlook for our overall return on equity.’ The comments came alongside results for the financial year ended March. Pretax loss in the year narrowed to £341 million from £622 million a year prior. EPRA earnings fell 5.6% to £371 million from £393 million a year prior, with EPRA earnings per share also down 5.6% to 50.1 pence from 53.1p. EPRA net tangible assets per share decreased 8.2% to 859p on March 31 from 936p a year prior. The total dividend was increased by 2.6% to 39.6p from 38.6p a year ago, in line with guidance of low single digit percentage growth. FRP Advisory jumped 12%. In the year that ended April 30, the London-based business advisory firm said it had delivered an ‘excellent trading performance’, adding that it was ‘confident for the year ahead’. FRP expects to report £128 million in revenue for the year, up 23% from £104 million a year prior. Underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation are expected to rise 37% to £37 million from £27 million in financial 2023. Both figures are ahead of current market consensus, FRP said, which forecast £123 million in revenue and £32 million in Ebitda.

However, shares in the Cartier-to-Montblanc owner rose 5% to 144 Swiss francs as record annual sales highlighted Richemont’s resilience and investors welcomed the appointment of Nicolas Bos, CEO of Van Cleef & Arpels, to the re-established role of group CEO. This role has been vacant for over a decade, so investors are clearly hoping Bos can introduce some extra growth sparkle at Richemont despite a stiff headwind from slowing sales across the luxury industry. Q4 SLOWDOWN Annual sales ticked up 3% at actual exchange rates to €20.6 billion (£17.7 billion) at  , an all-time high for the jewellery, watches and leather goods giant despite the well-documented slowdown in spending on luxury goods. But fourth quarter sales slipped 1% to €4.8 billion at reported rates amid a slowdown in Asia Pacific, while full year operating profit declined by 5% to €4.8 billion after adverse currency swings. JEWELLERY BRANDS SHINE Once again, Richemont’s growth was driven by its jewellery maisons, which include Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, with divisional sales up 6% to €14.2 billion euros reflecting growth across all regions and in both the retail and wholesale channels. Chairman Johann Rupert described Richemont’s results as ‘solid’, probably a fair characterisation in the context of unfavourable foreign exchange movements and ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. ‘We experienced a softening of sales in the fourth quarter in Asia Pacific against challenging comparatives, which was more than offset by higher growth in all the other regions,’ explained Rupert. ‘As we predicted, a sustainable rebound in Chinese demand would take some time.’ MEET THE BOS Alongside the numbers, Richemont named Nicolas Bos, who currently heads up its French luxury jewellery brand Van Cleef & Arpels, to the re-established group CEO role, effective 1 June. , who knows the business inside out, having joined Richemont back in 1992, will continue to report to Rupert.

The potential offer equates to a 73% premium to Friday’s (17 May) closing price and comes after the board rejected four previous unsolicited proposals in recent months. The board said the current potential offer represents a ‘significant’ increase on the initial proposal by EQT. After careful consideration, the board said it would be minded to recommend the   to shareholders should a firm offer be made which, under stock exchange rules must be made by close of play on the 15 June. ‘In the meantime, Keywords Studios shareholders are strongly advised to take no action’, the company said. The board said it remains confident in the company’s growth strategy of ‘building the only truly global platform providing solutions to the video games and entertainment industries, both organically and through acquisitions, and EQT is supportive of this strategy’. Shares in Keywords Studios jumped as much as 70% to £24.98 in early trading before settling down to £23.64, a new 12-month high. They remain around 25% below their all-time high of £33 reached in September 2021. Since listing on AIM in July 2013, the shares have increased 19-fold, equivalent to a compound annualised growth rate of 30% a year, making them one of the most successful shares to list on the UK stock market. EXPERT VIEW Noting post-pandemic share price weakness, Shore Capital’s Katie Cousins said she believes Keywords is well positioned to benefit from continued outsourcing trends in the video gaming industry. ‘That being said, whilst still growing, the organic growth has slowed over the past few years and profit margins appear fairly fixed over the medium term’, added Cousins. The analyst has reduced her recommendation to hold from buy given the latest share price move takes them above her £18 price target. You can opt out at any time."},

Quinn’s move could be seen as ‘cashing in’ on good news after Balfour Beatty shares have gained over 9% year-to-date.  The FTSE 250 company recently said it continued to expect an increase in earnings after trading had been in-line so far in 2024. Balfour Beatty also expects further ‘major orders’ and it has made progress with three projects.

Today’s gain lifts the shares back into positive territory for the year to date and means they are up 27% over the last 12-months compared with a 2% fall in the FTSE AIM All-Share index over the same period. Subject to audit, the company expects to report full-year   of £128 million and adjusted underlying EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation) of £37 million. Consensus expectations currently sit at £123 million and £32 million respectively, in line with guidance the company provided at the half-year results. INCREASE IN ADMINISTRATIONS The company highlighted a ‘challenging’ year for UK businesses which caused the number of company administrations to increase by 22% with the construction and retail sectors bearing the brunt of the pain. This tailwind has kept FRP’s restructuring team busy with some high-profile appointments including the Body Shop, WiggleCRC and Readers Digest. FRP Advisory said it has strengthened its market leading position, where it has remained the most active administration appointment taker by volume and increased its market share to 16% from 14% in 2023. Growth was achieved across the different business lines with all five service pillars making positive contributions. Strong trading resulted in net cash on the balance sheet increasing to £29.7 million from £22.9 million in 2023. Looking ahead, chief executive Geoff Rowley said activity levels across all locations and business lines are encouraging, adding, ‘as a result, we start our new financial year with confidence of making further positive progress.’ ANALYST UPGRADES Berenberg analysts James Bayliss and Adam Chantry described the results as ‘highly impressive’. They increased their EBITDA forecast for 2024 by 16% and pushed through similarly-sized upgrades for 2025 and 2026. ‘With a net cash balance sheet, and a history of starting the year cautiously before reducing conservatism over the period, we think there is potential for upside risk to numbers on both an organic and inorganic basis,’ said the analysts.

There will be one more CPI release before the ECB announces its latest interest rate decision on June 6. Across the pond, Wall Street saw a mixed performance on Thursday, closing lower but hitting record levels across the day. Before closing lower, the Dow had set a fresh all-time high of 40,051.05.

The shares are priced at 324 pence each, raising £1.25 billion in total proceeds in the placing to institutional investors. In the FTSE 250, Tritax Big Box rose 0.2%. Tritax reported increased rental income from development activity in the three months ended March 31, amid its merger with UK Commerical Property REIT. The London-based real estate investment trust invests in large logistics warehouses. It completed the merger with its fellow FTSE 250 constituent on Thursday, following an agreement finalised in March for an all-share takeover. Prior to the merger, during the first quarter, Tritax Big Box added £1.3 million to annual contracted rent from 0.1 million square feet of development lettings, it said, and a further £7.4 million was added to passing rent from 0.8 million sq ft of practical completions in the period.

In China on Friday, the Shanghai Composite was up 1.0%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was up 1.1%.

Industrial output rose 6.7% on-year last month, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, building on a 4.5% increase in March. The figure was higher than the 5.5% tipped in a Bloomberg forecast of economists. However, retail sales growth – China’s key gauge of consumer spending – continued to slow, expanding just 2.3% – down from 3.1% in March and lower than forecasts. ‘The story of this month‘s data is that of prevailing caution by households and the private sector, as retail sales and fixed asset investment came in weaker than expected,’ said ING economist Lynn Song.

The mood in New York was supported by retailer Walmart’s first-quarter earnings beat and outlook raise. The FTSE 100 index edged down 7.15 points, 0.1%, at 8,438.65. The FTSE 250 added 47.21 points, 0.2%, at 20,822.84, and the AIM All-Share closed up 0.89 of a point, 0.1%, at 792.50. The Cboe UK 100 lost 0.2% at 841.48, the Cboe UK 250 ended up 0.2% at 18,140.27, and the Cboe Small Companies shot up 0.6% at 16,301.31. In European equities on Thursday, the CAC 40 in Paris fell 0.6%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt ended down 0.7%. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were each up 0.3% at the time of the London close. Walmart helped lift sentiment on Thursday on a first-quarter earnings beat and a guidance hike. The retailer traded 5.8% higher at the time of the closing bell in Europe, the best performer on the Dow, helping propel the index to a record high. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also traded at their best-ever level. ‘Notably, after a two-month period of FTSE outperformance, May has started to see that pattern reverse as US markets start to regain their foothold as the go to place for investors,’ Scope Markets analyst Joshua Mahony commented. ‘While US markets may have pushed into record highs, yesterday’s inflation data did little to encourage the view that above-target inflation is going away. Headline CPI remains in the mud, stuck above 3% for 37 consecutive months now. With markets pricing a whopping 75% chance of a September rate cut, that decision looks likely to take place against a backdrop of a CPI figure that is not too far removed from the current 3.4% announced yesterday. With market pricing looking out of kilter with reality, the weakness we have seen the in dollar looks likely to reverse if we see the Fed push back against those September rate cut expectations over the coming months.’ The pound was quoted at $1.2671 late on Thursday in London, up slightly compared to $1.2668 at the equities close on Wednesday. The euro stood at $1.0870, down a touch against $1.0872. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥155.26, higher compared to JP¥154.85. Numbers on Thursday showed US initial jobless claims were higher than expected for a second successive week. According to the Department of Labor, initial claims for unemployment benefits in the week to May 11 totalled 222,000, topping the FXStreet cited consensus of 220,000. New claims were lower than the 232,000 registered in the week to May 4. The prior week’s level was upwardly revised from 231,000. The reading for last week was the highest since August, and it topped the consensus of 210,000. Pantheon Macroeconomics analyst Ian Shepherdson commented: ‘Last week’s spike in claims always looked unsustainable; about half the increase appears to have been due to short-term benefit claims from NYC schools employees over spring break. That increase duly reversed almost in full, but claims elsewhere remain higher than two weeks ago. This is much too short a run of data to be definitive but it is consistent, at least, with signals of a rising trend in layoffs from the Challenger survey, [worker adjustment & retraining notification] notices, the NY Fed’s consumer survey of job loss fears, and Google searches for ’claim benefits’. We have long been expecting claims to trend higher in the spring, though we need to see a few more weeks’ data before we can be sure this upturn is real.’ In London, share price falls for a number of index heavyweights kept a lid on the FTSE 100. Oil majors Shell and BP each lost 1.4%, pharmaceutical firm GSK gave back 1.6% and consumer goods company Unilever lost 0.5%. The stocks all went ex-dividend on Thursday, meaning new buyers will not qualify for the latest payout. The index’s biggest faller, meanwhile, was Sage. The enterprise software firm slumped 9.4%. In the six months ended March, Sage said pretax profit rose 47% to £203 million from £139 million a year prior. Revenue climbed 5.5% to £1.15 billion from £1.09 billion. Underlying annualised recurring revenue rose 11% to £2.25 billion from £2.03 billion, reflecting growth across all regions balanced between new and existing customers. Its guidance disappointed, however. It expects the rate of organic total revenue growth for the full year ‘be broadly in line’ with the 9% seen in the first-half. It had previously predicted growth in line with financial 2023, when it grew 10%. The firm’s boss handed a vote of confidence to the London market, meanwhile. Steve Hare told the PA news agency the group was ‘very proud of its UK roots’ and was not considering switching its listing away from London. The domestic market has struggled to attract new listings and has seen a number of constituents in recent years either leave the London Stock Exchange altogether, or pursue primary listings elsewhere. Helping add a chink of light on what had been a dark outlook for initial public offerings in the City, Raspberry Pi said it plans to list on the London Main Market. Raspberry Pi makes low-cost single board computers and compute modules for industrial ’internet-of-things’ uses, as well as for enthusiasts and educators. The announcement from the firm followed a Reuters report that Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein will list in London and a Bloomberg report that Walgreens Boots Alliance will sell or spin-off UK pharmacy chain Boots, with a London listing one of the possibilities. On Thursday, Sky News reported that wound care technology firm Advanced Oxygen Therapy, or AOTI, is planning a float on AIM. The listing would value the company at £160 million. BT shares jumped 17% after a set of results that helped ease some pressure on the stock. It lifted its dividend as it forecast significantly improved cash flow in the coming years now that peak investment in its full-fibre roll-out has passed. Looking ahead, BT said it would focus on the UK and ‘explore all options to optimise our global business’. ‘When a share price is trading no higher than it did in 1984, it is fair to say that expectations are very low, and BT’s new boss Allison Kirkby is doing a fine job of skipping over a low bar with her first set of full-year results in charge,’ AJ Bell analyst Russ Mould commented. Revenue for the year to March 31 rose 0.6% to £20.80 billion. Pretax profit, however, fell 31% to £1.19 billion. BT increased its full-year dividend by 3.9% to 8.0 pence per share from 7.70p a year. Watches of Switzerland Group surged 20% after hailed a strong finish to its financial year, calming some concern about the tricky outlook for the luxury goods sector. Chief Executive Officer Brian Duffy said: ‘We finished the year strongly, with Q4 sales in line with guidance and ahead of consensus. Particularly pleasing was the performance in the US, with sales up 14% in the period.’ Fourth-quarter revenue climbed 3% on-year to £380 million, as it noted ‘strong’ demand for key brands. It said its pre-owned Rolex watch offering is ‘performing ahead of expectations’. Costain rose 3.3%. It said trading in the year to date is in line with expectations, underpinned by a number of contract wins. The Maidenhead, England-based construction and engineering company said that, while it is ‘mindful of the macro-economic backdrop, it remains confident in the group’s strategy and medium to long-term prospects.’ Costain said it continues to have a high-quality forward work position that ‘aligns with its strategic plans’ for both the Transportation and Natural Resources divisions. The company said it is in line to deliver its margin targets of an adjusted operating margin run-rate of 3.5% during the course of 2024 and 4.5% during the course of 2025. Brent oil was quoted at $83.05 a barrel late Thursday afternoon in London, up from $82.42 late Wednesday. Gold was quoted at $2,381.33 an ounce, largely unmoved from $2,381.08.

The FTSE 100 index was down 23.84 points, 0.3%, at 8,421.96. The FTSE 250 was down 13.91 points, 0.1%, at 20,761.72, and the AIM All-Share was up 0.98 of a point, 0.1%, at 792.59. The Cboe UK 100 was down 0.2% at 841.60, the Cboe UK 250 was up slightly at 18,110.83, and the Cboe Small Companies was up 0.3% at 16,249.49. In European equities on Thursday, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 0.5%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was down 0.2%. ‘After a sparkling session on Wall Street last night amid hopes that the latest inflation data raises the chances of a US interest rate cut, European markets didn’t share the joy,’ said AJ Bell’s Russ Mould. Stocks on Wall Street got a boost thanks to inflation data. The year-on-year US consumer price inflation rate cooled to 3.4% in April, from 3.5% in March, as expected, data from Bureau of Labor Statistics showed on Wednesday. Stocks in New York were called higher on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index are both called up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite called up 0.2%. On Wednesday, all three indices notched recorded closing highs. The Dow and S&P 500 surpassed previous highs recorded on March 28, while the Nasdaq moved past Tuesday’s previous record. The pound was quoted at $1.2670 at midday on Thursday in London, up slightly compared to $1.2668 at the equities close on Wednesday. The euro stood at $1.0869, down against $1.0872. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥154.74, lower compared to JP¥154.85. In the FTSE 100, BT shot up 11%. The telecommunications provider lifted its dividend, as it forecasts significantly improved cash flow in the coming years now that peak investment in its full-fibre roll-out has passed. Commenting as BT unveiled results for the financial year ending March, recently installed Chief Executive Allison Kirkby said: ‘Having passed peak capex on our full-fibre broadband rollout and achieved our £3 billion cost and service transformation programme a year ahead of schedule, we’ve now reached the inflection point on our long-term strategy.’ On the other hand, Sage Group lost 10%. The Newcastle upon Tyne-based accountancy software provider fell after it predicted slightly slower than expected full-year revenue growth despite making progress in the first half of the financial year. In the six months ending March, Sage said pretax profit rose 47% to £203 million from £139 million a year prior. Revenue climbed 5.5% to £1.15 billion from £1.09 billion. easyJet lost 5.7%. easyJet said it will promote its chief financial officer to chief executive next year, as the Luton Airport-based budget airline reported half-year results in line with its earlier guidance. easyJet said Kenton Jarvis, who has been CFO since 2021, will replace Johan Lundgren as CEO early in 2025. Lundgren has been in charge since the end of 2017, guiding the airline through the Covid-19 pandemic, which all but halted travel. Separately, easyJet said its pretax loss narrowed to £347 million in the six months that ended March 31 from £415 million a year before, as revenue rose by 21% to £3.27 billion from £2.69 billion. In the FTSE 250, Auction Technology rose 12%. In the six months ended March 31, revenue rose to $86.0 million from $80.8 million a year earlier. Pretax profit surged to £3.1 million from £600,000. Auction Technology noted that trading in the first six weeks of the second half has been in line with guidance. Amongst London’s small caps, Secure Trust Bank rose 6.0%. The provider of savings accounts and lending services said in the first quarter of 2024, the net loan book grew by 1.7% from the previous quarter and 11.9% compared to the first quarter of 2023. CEO David McCreadie said: ‘The group continued to grow net lending in the quarter and is trading in line with management expectations. I am pleased that the positive momentum from last year has continued and that we have taken another step towards our £4 billion net lending ambition.’ Brent oil was quoted at $82.28 a barrel at midday in London on Thursday, down from $82.42 late Wednesday. Gold was quoted at $2,381.70 an ounce, up against $2,381.08.

This followed a strong finish to the year to 28 April 2024, with fourth-quarter sales proving more resilient than feared in both the UK and US amid robust demand for key brands and an improving jewellery performance. Previous news flow from   around a slowdown in luxury retail spending had hammered the share price. This left many fund managers with red faces since the stock had been a favourite among professional investors running mid-cap portfolios, so the fact life isn’t getting worse was enough to trigger a substantial relief rally. AHEAD OF CONSENSUS Fourth-quarter sales ticked up 4% year-on-year to £380 million, ahead of the £375 million analysts were calling for, with the  Rolex ,  Breitling  and  Audemars Piguet  purveyor delivering continued market share gains on both sides of the pond. ‘We finished the year strongly, with Q4 sales in line with guidance and ahead of consensus,’ explained the no-nonsense Duffy. ‘Particularly pleasing was the performance in the US, with sales up 14% in the period.’ Luxury watch revenue rose 5% in the final quarter with demand for key brands remaining ‘strong’. The FTSE 250 firm also flagged a significant improvement in its jewellery performance. Jewellery sales were flat at constant currency, but this represented a sequential improvement on the 16% dip seen in the third quarter. Watches of Switzerland, which recently announced the acquisition of Italian luxury jewellery brand  , also confirmed its ambition to more than double sales and adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) by the end of full year 2028. CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM ‘We enter full-year 2025 with cautious optimism,’ stressed Duffy, with his charge guiding to full-year 2025 revenue of £1.67 billion to £1.73 billion, implying constant currency growth of 9% to 12%. ‘We have a terrific programme of showroom developments on both sides of the Atlantic with the Rolex flagship boutique on Old Bond Street, London; a 3,000 square foot Rolex boutique replacing the Mayors multi-brand in Atlanta, Georgia; and our first Rolex showroom in Texas in Plano. We are also looking forward to the Audemars Piguet Town House and the Mappin & Webb luxury jewellery showroom both in Manchester, and the expanded Patek Philippe space in Greenwich, Connecticut.’ Duffy added: ‘The inherent strength of the categories we operate in, coupled with our superior business model and retail expertise continues to set us apart.’ You can opt out at any time."},

Kenton Jarvis, board member and chief financial officer will takeover from Lundgren as CEO. Jarvis joined EasyJet in February 2021 and will continue in his current role during the succession period. The company said the search for his successor will commence shortly. Separately EasyJet reported a positive set results with a 22% increase in total revenue to £3.26 billion and a 17% increase in passenger revenue to £2.04 billion for the six months ending 31 March 2024. STRONG EARNINGS GROWTH The low-budget airline believes it is well positioned to deliver strong earnings growth year-on-year due to positive summer demand, strong EasyJet holidays profit growth and the £61 million reduction in winter losses. EasyJet saw a 12% increase in capacity to 42.3 million seats for the first half of 2024 compared to 37.9 million seats in the same year ago period. The number of passengers increased 11% to 36.7 million for the first half of 2024 compared to 33.1 million in the same year ago period. EasyJet said it was ‘on track’ to deliver their ambitious medium-term target of over £1 billion pre-tax profit.  The company continues to expand its network in the UK  and Europe with the launch of bases in Birmingham, Southend – its 10th UK base in 2025 and Alicante. EasyJet holidays has benefited from the Birmingham base launch with 15% of all departing airline seats being EasyJet holidays’ customers. EXPERT VIEW Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell said: ‘EasyJet cannot win over the market despite bouncing back from the pandemic and riding the boom in the travel sector. ‘The airline’s shares have taken another lurch downwards on the latest results and news that chief executive Johan Lundgren is stepping down next year. He is being replaced by finance boss Kenton Jarvis, which suggests a smooth passing of the baton and no change to corporate strategy. ‘The negative share price reaction implies that the market doesn’t approve of the appointment and that investors wanted an outsider to come in and shake things up. ‘One of the key goals for airlines is to make sure planes are as full as possible each flight. EasyJet expects its planes to be fuller this summer and says it is on track to hit a medium-term target of more than £1 billion pre-tax profit. Normally such news would be reassuring, but it’s just not enough to please the market.’ DISCLAIMER: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in this article owns Shares magazine.

Adjusted EPS (earnings per share) was down from $1.00 a year ago to $0.88 on a 13% fall in $12.7 billion revenue, the firm’s biggest annual decline in 15 years, according to CNBC. So, as pre-market data sees the stock rallying nearly 5% when US markets reopen later today (to $51.94), it tells us a lot about how far expectations have fallen. Wall Street Q3 estimates were pitched at $0.83 adjusted EPS on revenue of $12.48 billion and while Cisco raised full year 2024 (to end Jul) guidance – the company is now forecasting EPS of $3.69 to $3.71 on a revenue range of $53.6 billion to $53.8 billion – investors can still only hope for slightly narrower declines on 2023 figures than before. INDUSTRY WIDE EFFECTS The core trading theme for the networking company remains the continued impact of ‘customer and channel digestion’, or in other words, they bought lots of kit through and in the immediate aftermath of Covid when budgets were strong but are now managing through kit oversupply that has disrupted the normal tech refresh cycle. The focus for Cisco is to use its vast scale to push through this period of indigestion and leverage its broad portfolio. This can be seen in flexing its software muscle in things like networks security and now, following the rough $28 billion acquisition of data cruncher Splunk, in data monitoring, or what Cisco calls ‘observability’. In theory, this will help cap the impact of declines elsewhere. Yet the key question for the market is if we’ll see an end to this indigestion soon, and that’s depends on who you talk to. ‘It doesn’t seem like it, with macroeconomic uncertainty still a key factor behind customers choosing to sweat assets for longer’, says Megabuyte analyst Sumitha Pillay.

The FTSE 100 index opened down 31.09 points, 0.4%, at 8,414.71. The FTSE 250 was up 34.30 points, 0.2%, at 20,809.93, and the AIM All-Share was up 0.2 of a point at 791.81.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices increased 0.3% in April, easing from a 0.4% rise in March from February. Prices had been expected to register another 0.4% rise last month, according to FXStreet cited consensus. ‘Markets will continue to digest yesterday’s US CPI inflation and retail sales reports, and to what extent they have shifted monetary policy expectations. The data have dampened risks that the Fed may have to resume interest rate hikes and will likely reinforce the current policy stance to keep them on hold at current restrictive levels for now while rate-setters wait for more data,’ said analysts at Lloyds Bank.

Pretax profit fell to £1.19 billion from £1.73 billion. BT explained that pretax profit fell due to impairment of goodwill and increased depreciation. BT increased its dividend by 3.9% annually to 8.0p. On the other hand, Sage Group lost 10%. The Newcastle upon Tyne, England-based enterprise software company reported that revenue in the six months ended March 31 rose to £1.15 billion from £1.09 billion a year ago.

Separately, easyJet said that Johan Lundgren will step down as chief executive and leave the company in 2025 having then served seven years as CEO. At that time, Kenton Jarvis will succeed Johan and become CEO. Jarvis joined easyJet in February 2021 as chief financial officer. In the FTSE 250, Watches of Switzerland jumped 16%. The Leicester, England-based watch retailer said that in its final quarter of financial 2024 sales were line with guidance and ahead of consensus. Watches of Switzerland financial year runs to April 28. Looking ahead, the company said it is ‘cautiously optimistic’ about trading in financial 2025. Future rose 15%.

Investors may have been cheered by the firm's ability to raise tobacco prices and the increase in NGP (next-generation product) revenue for the six months to March. GROWING MARKET SHARE Three out of five of Imperial Brands’ markets are growing – the US by 5 basis points (0.05%), Spain by 50 basis points (0.5%) and Australia by 10 basis points (0.1%) – offsetting declines in the UK and Germany. Over the past six months the tobacco firm has launched new products in all categories, including entry ‘into the US oral nicotine market with the new zone brand' and three ‘Sense Hubs’ in Liverpool, Hamburg, and Shenzhen. INTERIM DIVIDEND INCREASE It was good news for shareholders as the tobacco firm confirmed its ongoing £1.1 billion share buyback programme for this year and its ambition to deliver three-year cumulative returns of £6 billion. The company also announced an increased interim dividend up 4%. EXPERT VIEWS Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett said today's update would do nothing to help sentiment as the investment case has ‘little to do with fundamentals and is more about cash returns’, where despite leverage being at the low end of the company's range there was no new news. Also, on the fundamentals, which can't be completely ignored, there were ‘areas of possible concern’, said Bennett, the main ones being the company is no longer taking combustible share across its top five markets and US volumes are now looking pressured, although European volumes were ‘somewhat encouraging’. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell said: ‘The harm caused by smoking means the sector is likely to remain under regulatory pressure – particularly in the West – and like its peers, Imperial Brands is aiming to mitigate this risk by diversifying into sales of so-called NGPs such as vaping and e-cigarettes. ‘These are growing rapidly but they still represent a minimal proportion of group revenue and remain loss making. Traditional tobacco products are doing the heavy lifting when it comes generating the cash to underpin generous dividends and share buybacks. ‘For now, these are about keeping shareholders on board but eventually there may be impatience over a share price which has barely budged in five years.’ DISCLAIMER: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in this article owns Shares magazine.

In European equities on Wednesday, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 0.2%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was up 0.5%. ‘The market’s optimism is starting to look rather heroic. Despite higher than anticipated factory gate prices, US stocks made progress overnight and the FTSE 100 has followed this cue to reach a new record high,’ says AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. The next test for markets is the US consumer price reading this afternoon. The data is out at 1330 BST. According to FXStreet-cited consensus, consumer prices are expected to have risen 3.4% annually in April, cooling slightly from 3.5% in March. Analysts at ING said the data will be ‘pivotal’. US producer prices rose as expected in April on-year, quickening from March and swinging to inflation on a monthly basis, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday. The US producer price index for final demand rose by 0.5% in April from March, swinging from slight deflation of 0.1% in March from February and beating expectations of a 0.3% rise. Annually, US producer prices rose by 2.2% in April, in line with expectations, while the BLS noted it marked the largest increase since rising 2.3% for the 12 months ended April 2023. In March, prices had risen by 1.8% on-year. Stocks in New York were called to open mixed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index are called up marginally, however the Nasdaq Composite is called down slightly.

In an upbeat statement alongside results for the year to March, the Dublin-based consumer credit checker said full-year growth was ‘was at the top end of our expectations.’ Experian said pretax profit in the year ended March 31 jumped 32% to $1.55 billion from $1.17 billion a year prior. Revenue rose 7.3% to $7.10 billion from $6.62 billion. Reflecting the strong performance, Experian upped its full year dividend by 7% to 58.50 cents from 54.75 cents. Imperial Brands rose 4.6%. The London-based tobacco and nicotine product company, whose brands include Gauloises and L&B, reported £1.49 billion in operating profit for the six months ended March 31, down 2.6% from £1.53 billion a year prior. Revenue for the half was down 2.3% to £15.06 billion from £15.41 billion. Imperial raised its interim dividend 4.0% to 44.90p from 43.18p. In the FTSE 250, Hunting shot up 22%, after it announced a record order from Kuwait Oil Co. The London-based manufacturer of equipment for the energy industry said it has secured a record $145 million order from the Kuwaiti firm for oil country tubular goods. Management now anticipates earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation at the top end of its $125 million to $135 million guidance. Keller rose 16%. The London-based geotechnical engineering firm said that in the first fourth months of 2024, its ‘strong momentum’ continued. It noted that overall performance was materially ahead of prior year. Britvic shot up 11%. The Hemel Hempstead, England-based soft drinks maker, behind brands such as Robinsons squash and R White’s lemonade, said pretax profit rose 13% to £78.2 million in the six months ended March from £69.3 million a year prior. This came as revenue climbed 11% to £880.3 million from £794.0 million. Chief Executive Simon Litherland described the results as ‘excellent’. Amongst London’s small-caps, Zotefoams rose 13%. The cellular material technology provider reported ‘good progress’ towards commercialisation of ReZorce beverage cartons. Chief Executive David Stirling commented: ‘The announcements we are making today are indicative of the gathering momentum on this project. We are proud that Refresco, a world leader in its field, has recognised the potential of ReZorce and has chosen to partner with us to accelerate its commercial launch.’ Brent oil was quoted at $82.37 a barrel at midday in London on Wednesday, up from $82.25 late Tuesday.

The shares jumped 7% to £37.75 taking gains over the last 12-months to 35%, handsomely outperforming the blue-chip FTSE 100 return of 9%. Interestingly, chief executive Brian Cassin talked up rising margins and flagged the $1.9 billion of operating cash flow. For full year 2025, Cassin anticipates further strategic progress and expects to deliver organic revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8%. ‘We also expect good margin expansion, in the range of 30-50 basis points, at constant currency.’ GROWTH AHEAD OF MARKET FORECASTS For the year ended 31 March   increased 7% to $7.1 billion and operating earnings were 7% higher at $1.93 billion representing a margin on sales 27.2% compared with 27.1% in 2023. Organic revenue growth of 6% was ahead of consensus analyst forecasts calling for 5.5%. All regions contributed to growth with Latin America the standout performer achieving double-digit growth. Adjusted EPS (earnings per share) increased 8% to $1.45, and the business converted 97% of profit into operating cash flow.  Experian ended the period with net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation) of 1.7 times. The full year dividend was increased by 7% to $0.585 per share which is covered 2.5 times by earnings per share. WHAT ARE THE EXPERTS SAYING? ‘There was a lot to like in Experian’s latest full-year results both from a short- and medium-term perspective’, said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. ‘The credit rating group expects a boost from a modest improvement in economic conditions but is also proving a master of its own destiny through innovation. ‘Inevitably, this involves the use of AI but also a full transition towards the cloud which will increase productivity and enable the company to offer customers a greater breadth and depth of insights.’ With spending on the cloud expected to peak over the next couple of years, financial results should benefit thereafter as capital expenditure comes down. Analyst Robin Speakman at Shore Capital commented: ‘We retain the view that Experian is a strategically valuable business.’ The analyst said that high sustained margins drive strong cash generation and strategic flexibility in delivering shareholder value.

The FTSE 250 ended up 157.11 points, 0.8%, at 20,775.63, and the AIM All-Share rose 1.88 points, 0.2%, at 791.61. The Cboe UK 100 rose 0.1% at 843.15, the Cboe UK 250 climbed 1.1% at 18,105.05, and the Cboe Small Companies added 0.5% at 16,207.89. In European equities on Wednesday, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.2%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt ended up 0.8%. Both achieved record closes, though unlike the DAX, the CAC did not hit a record intraday level on Wednesday. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7% at the time of the closing bell in Europe. The S&P 500 surged 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.0%. The S&P and Nasdaq traded at record highs. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics, the year-on-year consumer price inflation rate cooled to 3.4% in April, from 3.5% in March, as expected. On a monthly basis, consumer prices increased 0.3% in April, easing from a 0.4% rise in March from February. Prices had been expected to register another 0.4% rise last month, according to FXStreet cited consensus. The data follows comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday, who cautioned on robust inflation. Recent hot US inflation data has lowered his level of confidence that price rises will slow back down towards the bank’s long-term target, the central banker said. ‘The first quarter in the US was notable for its lack of further progress on inflation,’ Powell commented during an event in the Netherlands that was streamed online. ‘We did not expect this to be a smooth road, but these were higher than I think anybody expected,’ he continued. ‘And so what that has told us is we’ll need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work.’ Powell said that, while he still expected inflation to move back down towards the levels seen last year, ‘my confidence in that is not as high as it was having seen these readings in these first three months of the year.’ XTB analyst Kathleen Brooks commented: ‘The market is now pricing in two full rate cuts from the Fed this year, which was not the case on Tuesday. Thus, today’s economic data has moved the dial on Fed rate cut expectations. This is a market-friendly report, which supports the Fed’s view that rates will be cut once there is evidence that inflation is falling back to the target rate. If we see another couple of CPI reports that continues in this trend, then a late summer rate cut could be in the cards.’ US retail sales were weaker than expected last month, numbers on Wednesday showed. According to the Census Bureau, retail sales were flat in April from March, well below an FXStreet cited forecast which predicted a 0.4% rise. In March from February, retail sales had risen 0.6%, downwardly revised from an initially reported 0.7% climb. The pound was quoted at $1.2668 at the time of the London equities close on Wednesday, higher compared to $1.2582 on Tuesday. The euro stood at $1.0872, up against $1.0818. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥154.85, lower compared to JP¥156.41. In London, there were a series of M&A developments to grab investor focus. Royal Mail owner International Distributions Services jumped 18% as it announced it would be minded to accept a revised non-binding proposal for a potential takeover offer from EP Corporate. The new revised offer posted on Wednesday represents a total value of 370 pence per IDS share, 16% higher than the old offer of around 320p. It values IDS’s share capital at around £3.5 billion. ‘The proposal follows significant negotiation including a number of earlier proposals from EP Group,’ IDS said. Prague-based EP Corporate is majority owned by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky. Kretinsky’s other investments include stakes in UK supermarket chain Sainsbury’s, French newspaper Le Monde and London football club West Ham United. After rejecting a takeover tilt, meanwhile, John Wood Group fell 7.2%. It shrugged off a new takeover proposal from planning, design, engineering and project management firm Sidara. Consulting and engineering firm Wood Group said the new offer of 212 pence per share, around £1.46 billion in total, continued to ‘fundamentally undervalue’ the company and its future prospects. The offer was 3.4% higher than Sidara’s initial offer of 205p. Elsewhere, housebuilder Redrow said shareholders backed its acquisition by larger peer Barratt Developments. Both Redrow and Barratt climbed 0.8%. Interest rate optimism following the US data lifted the housebuilding sector. Accrol Group said its shareholders approved its takeover by Portuguese integrated pulp, paper, tissue and packaging Navigator. Accrol shares ended the day 0.8% higher. Elsewhere in London, Experian added 8.4%. The Dublin-based consumer credit checker said full-year growth was ‘was at the top end of our expectations.’ Experian said pretax profit in the year ended March 31 jumped 32% to $1.55 billion from $1.17 billion a year prior. Revenue rose 7.3% to $7.10 billion from $6.62 billion. Reflecting the strong performance, Experian upped its full year dividend by 6.8% to 58.50 cents from 54.75 cents. On the decline, Burberry slumped 7.3%. It said pretax profit plummeted 40% to £383 million in the financial year that ended March 30 from £634 million the year prior. Adjusted operating profit fell 34% to £418 million from £634 million. This was at the bottom end of the range of £410 million to £460 million given by Burberry in January when it lowered guidance. Revenue fell at a less severe 3.9% to £2.97 billion from £3.09 billion a year earlier. Looking ahead, Burberry said it expects trade in the first half of financial 2025 to ‘remain challenging’. Brent oil was quoted at $82.42 a barrel in London late on Wednesday afternoon, up from $82.25 late Tuesday. Gold was quoted at $2,381.08 an ounce, up against $2,351.24.

The news took the shine off a strong start to the year with first-quarter organic revenue up 6.5% which was slightly ahead of market forecasts. SHORT-TERM UNCERTAINTY Convatec reduced the growth outlook for Advanced Wound Care to mid to high single digit from high single digit following a proposed draft local insurance coverage determination in the US released on 25 April. Convatec said while its chronic wound care products trading under the InnovaMatrix brand technically met the requirements of the draft proposal, its recent entry to the market and timeline needed to publish clinical evidence meant InnovaMatrix was not currently on the draft proposed covered list. Launched in early 2022, InnovaMatrix products generated revenue of $74 million in 2023 equating to just over 3% of group revenue. The company is actively engaging with all relevant parties as part of the 45-day consulting process currently underway. ‘We are seeking an outcome that preserves choice for clinicians treating chronic wounds, ensures access to innovative, effective products which are in the best interest of patients and maintains the benefits of the well-proven 510(k) pathway for fostering innovation of new products for the benefit of patients.’ GUIDANCE MAINTAINED First-quarter growth was broad-based across the company’s four divisions including a better-than-expected contribution from Continence Care where   growth was in the high single digits. The company said it remained confident of delivering on its full year-guidance which calls for organic revenue growth of 5% to 7%, an adjusted operating margin of at least 21% and double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share. The group's medium-term guidance was also unchanged - the company is targeting 5% to 7% organic revenue growth and an expansion in adjusted operating margin to a mid-twenty’s percentage by 2026 or 2027, with double-digit compound annual growth in adjusted earnings per share.

And with the share price having more than halved over the past 12 months, Burberry is now ‘a screaming takeover target for someone who is able to look beyond current problems and recognise the true value of the brand over the long term’, according to AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. The British luxury brand’s operating profit declined by more than a third in the year to March 2024 with margins under pressure and sales slumping in the fourth quarter in its key market of China. The trench coat-to-tote bag seller warned the first half of the new financial year is likely to ‘remain challenging’ and also expects a full year currency headwind of around £20 million to adjusted operating profit. BAD NEWS ACROSS THE BOARD  reported a 4% drop in revenue to £2.97 billion for the year to March, with adjusted operating profit plunging 34% to £418 million, at the lower end of the £410 million to £460 million guidance range but 3% above the £406.8 million consensus estimate. Last year proved a game of two halves for Burberry, which generated 10% comparable store sales growth in the first half before suffering an 8% decline in the second amid a wider luxury industry slowdown. Burberry is among the fashion giants that have been badly affected with high-end customers becoming more discerning about the brands they buy. 20% CHINA SALES SLUMP Comparable store sales fell 12% in the fourth quarter, pulled lower by a 19% slump in mainland China, while the Americas region remained soft with comparable store sales down 12% for both Q4 and the year as a whole. While rainwear-to-leather goods purveyor Burberry expects to see the benefit of cost savings and other turnaround actions from the second half of full year 2025, wholesale revenue is estimated to fall by ‘around 25%’ in the first half. As  Shares  outlined in February, the   behind the iconic Burberry check and Equestrian Knight Device is pulling self-help levers including elevation of the brand to raise margins closer to those of rivals including  LVMH (MC:EPA)  whilst pushing ahead with store refurbishments. Julie Palmer, partner at  Begbies Traynor  ( ) , said the tough picture for luxury fashion ‘cannot be ignored, with customers in key markets such as China and the US scaling back on discretionary spending as inflation remains at heightened levels, while UK sales haven’t been helped by the removal of tax free shopping. However, Burberry is clearly struggling to cut through the gloom more than most, with today’s estimates that revenues will fall by around a quarter in H1, suggesting the company is now truly on the defensive.’ Palmer added that CEO Jonathan Akeroyd will ‘really need to call on Burberry’s stable of talent to ensure this tricky period is navigated and, certainly for now, annual sales targets of £5 billion look far from being in the bag.’ DISCLAIMER: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in this article owns Shares magazine.

The stock price leapt 178p or 15.7% to a new all-time high of £13.14, surpassing the previous high struck more than a decade ago, with more shares traded by mid-morning than in a normal day. STRONG MOMENTUM When it published its full-year results in March the firm remarked on the strong start to the year, and today it confirmed that positive momentum had continued into the second quarter ‘with overall performance materially ahead of the prior year’. ‘This momentum, combined with a strong order book and recent contract wins, gives us good visibility and enhanced confidence in performance for the remainder of the year. Accordingly, we now anticipate full year performance to be materially ahead of the board's original expectations’, the company added. Trading in the US continues to be supported by the ongoing infrastructure spend under the Inflation Reduction Act, while the foundations business has seen a ‘sustained improvement in operational improvement’ and the Suncoast business is up on the same period last year despite a softer residential construction market. In Europe and the Middle East, infrastructure is again the bright spot with residential and commercial construction remaining weak, while in the Asia-Pacific region Austral traded profitably and Keller Australia had a strong start to the year albeit with lower volumes than 2023. Cash generation was strong, and the group expects its net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) ratio to be at the low end of its target range of 0.5 times to 1.5 times at the half-year stage. ANALYSTS BEHIND THE CURVE Before today’s  , analysts were forecasting 2024 revenue of £2.88 billion, a 3%  decrease  on last year, while operating profits were seen at just £162 million against £181 million, implying a decline of more than 10% on 2023. In fact, analysts didn’t expect Keller to equal or beat 2023’s results until 2026 when they forecast the firm would make £3.1 billion of revenue and £180 million of operating profit, so there needs to be a radical rethink and we would expect to see a raft of upgrades in the coming weeks.

If customers don’t have a compelling reason to buy a product, they won’t.” While the outlook for this year’s ISA season is less grim than it was 12 months ago, there are still headwinds for markets in the year ahead. The UK slipped into recession at the end of 2023 , while growth across Europe is anaemic . Only the US is bucking the trend, but interest rates are starting to dampen growth expectations there as well. Capital at risk.  The value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise and are not guaranteed. Investors may not get back the amount originally invested. In this environment, finding resilient companies is particularly important. While struggling businesses might be able to limp on in more robust economic conditions, their weaknesses will be exposed by a tougher climate. This will be reflected in sliding share prices. But there are plenty of companies that can, and do, transcend the economic environment – and may even get stronger. They tend to share a number of characteristics. On the right side of interest rates Interest rates have been a key factor in the economic slowdown experienced over the last 18 months. If interest rates are low, it allows companies with high debt to stay in business because the cost of repaying that debt is lower. As interest rates rise, that debt becomes more expensive and takes up a larger share of a company’s costs. This is often one of the biggest risks factors for companies. Their profits drop, they cannot pay their debts and eventually, they go bankrupt. As Warren Buffett said: “only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked” . Official government figures in the UK showed the number of companies going bust hit a 30-year high in January 2024 . This is why across all the BlackRock investment trust portfolios, we are looking for companies with low debt and strong balance sheets. We want to ensure companies aren’t vulnerable to every central bank move. Pricing power is another priority for our fund managers. Pricing power is the ability for companies to raise the prices of their products and services. They may be able to do this because they have a strong brand, or their products are in high demand, or, as in the case of areas such as healthcare, their product is unique. While inflation has been easing, input costs of all kinds continue to rise. If companies can’t pass those additional costs onto their customers, it will hurt their profitability. Equally, during tough economic conditions, the pie gets smaller. If customers don’t have a compelling reason to buy a product, they won’t. We want companies whose revenues are defensive and enduring. Companies that go into a tough climate in a strong financial position can capitalise. Their indebted, weaker competitors may go bust, allowing agile companies to occupy the space they have left behind, buy their competitors or take over the strategic assets they leave behind, all at a cheaper price. Good companies will often emerge from difficult conditions in a stronger position than they went in. This is also where a strong management team can be vitally important. A good, experienced management team will understand how to adapt the business to changing conditions, to make strategic acquisitions or sales. They will know which areas to prioritise and where to cut back. They will understand how to put the company in prime position for the recovery when it arrives. Fund managers with a depth of resources can look at a company from all sides, talk to its competitors, its suppliers and its management team. The fund managers across BlackRock’s range of investment trusts can call on a skilled global analyst team, with specialists across every sector and in every region. We believe this gives us a real edge in tougher conditions. We run high conviction portfolios and the portfolio will always reflect the fund managers’ best ideas. Holding in an ISA can super-charge your investment, meaning your investment can compound faster. The recent changes to the UK ISA regime mean that investors will be able to get an additional £5,000 by investing in UK assets, allowing £25,000 a year to be sheltered from tax. At BlackRock, we have a breadth of investment trusts covering the UK, including growth and income options, but also a range of international markets. Our view is that good companies can thrive in all conditions. The key is finding them. At BlackRock, we have built the infrastructure to find those opportunities wherever they may lie.

The value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise and are not guaranteed. Investors may not get back the amount originally invested. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results and should not be the sole factor of consideration when selecting a product or strategy. Changes in the rates of exchange between currencies may cause the value of investments to diminish or increase. Fluctuation may be particularly marked in the case of a higher volatility fund and the value of an investment may fall suddenly and substantially.

Chief executive Margherita Della Valle, appointed to the top Job at  Vodafone  ( )  just over a year ago, has now laid out the script of her final act; rebasing the dividend. The shareholder payout for full year 2024 (to 31 Mar) was left untouched at €0.09, but investors will get only half that in the current year, targeting a more sustainable dividend of €0.045 per share ‘with an ambition to grow it over time.’ PAYOUT THREAT FLAGGED IN OCTOBER Regular  Shares  readers may recall a feature from October 2023 when we pointed out how at risk the previous dividend had become long before any cut was being pencilled in to forecasts by analysts. Shares in Vodafone managed to nudge a couple of percentage points higher on the results, to 71.64p, but this is scant reward for a share price that has been in a dismal decline for more than a decade. The rebased forward yield now stands at 5.4%. At least Della Valle accepts that ‘much more still needs to be done’, promising a step-up in investment in customer experience, improvements to the performance in Germany and further streamlining of operations following the sale of operations in Italy and Spain. Vodafone has tried to sweeten the dividend  pill with a €2 billion share buyback funded from the proceeds from the Spain sale, with the possibility of an extra €2 billion buyback once the Italy deal is completed, probably in the first half of 2025. WATCHDOG STOPS THE THREE MERGER CLOCK But for the time being, Vodafone seems likely to remain in a sort of suspended animation while its proposed merger with Three UK drags on. The deal, which would give the enlarged Vodafone roughly 25% revenue share in the UK, recently got UK government approval on security grounds but the regulatory clock was stopped by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority after documents were apparently filed late. In a statement on 10 May, the CMA said it decided to extend the inquiry period, which currently has a statutory deadline of 18 September 2024, because Three UK’s parent company CK Hutchison failed to provide certain documents and information by 9 May.

The FTSE 100 index was up 5.85 points, 0.1%, at 8,420.89. The FTSE 250 was up 14.46 points, 0.1%, at 20,574.80, and the AIM All-Share was little changed at 786.60. The Cboe UK 100 was up 0.1% at 841.04, the Cboe UK 250 was up slightly at 17,884.26, and the Cboe Small Companies was up 0.3% at 16,081.01. In European equities on Tuesday, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 0.1% while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was down 0.2%. The Bank of England’s top economist has boosted hopes of lower borrowing costs after saying it is ‘not unreasonable’ to expect the bank to consider cutting interest rates over the summer. Huw Pill, the BoE’s chief economist, told an online event organised by the accountancy body ICAEW that the bank could consider cutting rates if inflation continues to ease off. Pill said: ‘I think it’s not unreasonable to believe that through the summer we will begin to see enough confidence in the decline in persistence that bank rate will come into consideration.’ BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said last week that a rate cut in June could not be ‘ruled out’, although he stressed it was not a ‘fait accompli’. His comments came as the Bank held rates at 5.25%, keeping them at the highest level since 2008, but were widely seen as strengthening the case for a cut. Pill said the UK jobs market was still tight by historical standards, even though latest official data also out Tuesday showed the unemployment rate rising to its highest for nearly a year, at 4.3% in the three months to March. According to the Office for National Statistics, the UK unemployment rate in the three months to March ticked up to 4.3% from 4.2% in the three months to February. The reading landed in line with FXStreet-cited market consensus. The ONS said average earnings excluding bonuses rose 6.0% on-year in the period, matching the pace of growth in the three months to February. Including bonuses, wages increased 5.7%, also matching the prior month, which was revised upwards from 5.6%. Market consensus had been anticipating a rise of just 5.3%. ING’s James Smith said the main takeaway from the figures was that the UK jobs market ‘is cooling and that’s gradually translating into lower wage growth.’ Sterling was quoted at $1.2553 at midday on Tuesday, little changed from $1.2552 at the London equities close on Monday. The euro traded at $1.0795 at midday on Tuesday, up from $1.0791 late Monday. Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at JP¥156.41, up from JP¥156.21. In London’s FTSE 100, luxury goods retailer Burberry was in demand, up 2.8% ahead of its full year results on Wednesday. Vodafone was also in the green, up 3.4%, after reporting a return to growth in Germany, as it delivered full-year results slightly ahead of its expectations. The Newbury, Berkshire-based telecommunications provider said pretax profit fell 88% to €1.62 billion in the financial year that ended March 31 from €13.07 billion the year prior. Vodafone said this primarily reflects business disposals in the prior financial year, in particular the €8.6 billion gain on the disposal of Vantage Towers. Revenue declined by 2.5% to €36.72 billion from €37.67 billion a year prior. Chief Executive Margherita Della Valle said Vodafone was ‘delivering growth in all of our markets across Europe and Africa.’ She said the performance was ‘slightly ahead of expectations’ but stressed ‘much more still needs to be done.’ Leading the fallers, DCC fell 3.5%, after reporting a drop in annual pretax profit and revenue. Dublin-based DCC is a provider of sales, marketing and support services. It said pretax profit declined by 1.8% to £423.7 million in the financial year that ended March 31 from £431.6 million the year before, as revenue fell by 11% to £19.86 billion from £22.21 billion. Anglo American fell 1.4% after it unveiled a new ‘radical’ strategy that will see it keep copper and iron ore assets, while getting rid of platinum and diamond businesses. The move, which follows a ‘comprehensive asset review’, comes a day after the London-based mining company rebuffed a sweetened takeover offer from BHP Group, its major peer. To unlock shareholder value and to simplify its portfolio, Anglo American said it intends to ‘demerge’ Anglo American Platinum and also ‘divest’ or ‘demerge’ De Beers as part of its new strategy. The diversified miner also wants to divest its steelmaking coal business, saying it is already responding to ‘strong’ buyer interest. It is also exploring options for care and maintenance and divestment of its nickel operations. ‘Bid or no bid, it looks as if we‘re getting a break-up of Anglo American whatever the outcome,’ said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell. ‘However, there are major consequences if Anglo American demerges or sells certain interests including diamond, platinum and coal assets.’ ‘Doing so would effectively make Anglo American even more attractive to potential bidders as it would have slimmed down and got rid of a lot of the fat that someone like BHP wouldn’t want,’ Coatsworth felt. In the FTSE 250, Currys soared 9.1%. The electricals retailer raised full-year profit guidance after a reporting like-for-like sales returned to growth in the 16 weeks to April 27. As a result, Currys expects full-year adjusted pretax profit will be £115 million to £120 million, up from guidance of at least £105 million before. Chief Executive Alex Baldock said: ‘Our performance is strengthening, with good momentum in the UK&I, and with the Nordics getting back on track. Sales are now growing again, margins are benefiting from higher customer adoption of solutions and services, and cost discipline is good. All this means improved profits and, with our strong cash position, we’re well set up for the year ahead.’ Analysts at Liberum noted this was the ‘third consecutive upgrade year-to-date and means cumulative upgrades of around 24%.’ ‘The current valuation remains far too cheap, giving no credit for any further earnings upside even as momentum now turns positive and ahead of macro signs improving,’ Liberum added. Elsewhere, Treatt rose 4.4% after predicting full-year profit in line with its expectations. It said that it has built strong momentum going into the second half, with a ‘solid order book and healthy sales pipeline’. But Headlam plunged 12% after it said it would report a ‘significant’ pretax loss in the first half on a double-digit revenue decline. The Birmingham-based floor coverings company said revenue in the four months to April 30 was down by slightly more than 12% from a year before, with the UK down 12% and continental Europe down 17%. The expected spring seasonal uplift did not occur, Headlam said. On AIM in London, Sondrel leapt 55% after raising £5.6 million from a subscription priced at 10 pence each by ROX Equity Partners Ltd. Stocks in New York were little changed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite were all expected to open flat. The main focal point for investors this week will be Wednesday’s US inflation figures, which will likely inform market expectations of potential US interest rate cuts. According to FXStreet-cited consensus, consumer prices are expected to have risen 3.4% annually in April, cooling slightly from 3.5% in March.

It was not all ‘doom and gloom’ however, as the beach holiday retailer reported an 11% increase in group revenue to £80.8 million for the six months to 31 March 2024. Today’s share price performance was in stark contrast to yesterday’s rally which saw On The Beach shares close (13 May) at the 168p mark ahead of reporting its first half results. Shares in the company have also rallied 18% over the past year. (Total Transaction Value)   for the period was £597.8 million, up 22% year-on-year, while total cash increased by £32 million year-on-year. On The Beach also rewarded shareholders with an interim dividend of 0.9p per share, its first distribution since February 2020 reflecting management’s continued confidence in the company’s prospects. PREMIUM MARKET CONTINUES TO GROW CEO Shaun Morton told  Shares  that the premium market continues to grow strongly ‘with customers booking 4-star and 5-star holiday packages to Turkey, Greece and Portugal’. The company also said its long-haul market continues to outperform as it continues to add new destinations. The beach holiday specialist also prides itself on an enhanced customer experience and offers its customers benefits like, fast-track through airport security, access to premium airport lounges and free mobile data. RYANAIR PARTNERSHIP On The Beach’s partnership with Michael O’ Leary’s low-budget airline  Ryanair (RYA)  is also well underway. Back in February, the beach holiday retailer signed a long-term distribution agreement with Ryanair which allows it to freely access Ryanair’s seat supply with ‘increased price transparency’. On The Beach will still be able to offer its customers flexible payment plans, perks and ATOL protection under the terms of the agreement. Analysts at  Peel Hunt  ( )   were positive overall about the latest set of figures but expressed caution regarding the take up of the beach holiday retailer’s value offering. ‘Trading is strong and operating leverage is clearly coming through. The B2B channel is to be restructured to improve efficiency. The Ryanair partnership creates new opportunities,’ said the broker. ‘However, there is clearly some pressure on the consumer of value holidays and management’s guidance that the business is trading in line with consensus is clearly based on line of sight to the year-end. With that in mind we have lowered our full year 2022 estimated adjusted (earnings before interest taxation depreciation and amortisation) forecast to the mid-point range.’ You can opt out at any time."},

Amongst individual stocks, Experian jumped as shareholders celebrated higher revenue and profit. Burberry fell, however, as it warned of a tough start to its new financial year. The FTSE 100 index opened up 40.31 points, 0.5%, at 8,468.44. The FTSE 250 was up 83.64 points, 0.4%, at 20,702.16, and the AIM All-Share was up 0.75 of a point, 0.1%, at 790.48. The Cboe UK 100 was up 0.4% at 845.66, the Cboe UK 250 was up 0.6% at 18,012.17, and the Cboe Small Companies was up marginally at 16,127.40. In European equities on Wednesday, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.1%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was up 0.2%. Stocks in Europe were in the green on Wednesday morning, a sign of cautious optimism ahead of a key US inflation print. In the US on Tuesday, Wall Street ended higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.3%, the S&P 500 up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.8%. Eyes are firmly on Wednesday’s consumer price index data at 1330 BST. This is the main focal point for investors this week. According to FXStreet-cited consensus, consumer prices are expected to have risen 3.4% annually in April, cooling slightly from 3.5% in March. ‘All eyes are on the US CPI update today. Both headline and core inflation are expected to have moderated last month. If that’s the case, the risk rally will likely continue,’ said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. On Tuesday, data showed that US producer price inflation picked up in April, as expected. US producer prices rose by 2.2% on-year in April, in line with expectations, after a 1.8% climb in March. On a monthly basis, prices rose by 0.5% in April from March, following a 0.1% fall in March from February and beating expectations of a 0.3% rise. The pound was quoted at $1.2596 early on Wednesday in London, higher compared to $1.2582 at the equities close on Tuesday. The euro stood at $1.0828, up against $1.0818. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥156.07, lower compared to JP¥156.41. In the FTSE 100, Experian grabbed the spotlight, jumping 6.3%. Experian reported that revenue rose to $7.10 billion in the year ended March 31, from $6.62 billion a year earlier. Pretax profit jumped to $1.55 billion from $1.17 billion. On the back of the results, Experian upped its full year dividend to 58.50 US cents from 54.75 cents. On the other hand, Burberry lost 3.8%, with financial results underperforming original expectations. The luxury retailer reported that revenue fell to £2.97 billion in the year ended March 30 from £3.09 billion a year earlier. Pretax profit plummeted to £383 million from £634 million. Burberry left its dividend unchanged at 61.0p. Looking ahead, Burberry said it expects trade in the first half of financial 2025 to ‘remain challenging’. In the FTSE 250, Hunting rose 14%. The London-based maker of parts and technology systems for the oil and gas sector said it has secured a ‘record’ $145 million oil country tubular goods order with the Kuwait Oil Co. It noted that revenue is expected to be recognised late into the fourth quarter of 2024 and into 2025. Given the timing of this order, Hunting now expects earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to be towards the top end of its current guidance of $125 to $135 million for 2024. Keller jumped 8.6%. The London-based geotechnical engineering firm said that in the first fourth months of 2024, its ‘strong momentum’ continued. It noted that overall performance was materially ahead of prior year. ‘This momentum, combined with a strong order book and recent contract wins, gives us good visibility and enhanced confidence in performance for the remainder of the year. Accordingly, we now anticipate full year performance to be materially ahead of the board’s original expectations,’ Keller added. In Asia on Wednesday, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo was up 0.1%. In China, the Shanghai Composite was down 0.8%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was down 0.2%. The S&P/ASX 200 in Sydney closed up 0.4%. Brent oil was quoted at $82.71 a barrel early in London on Wednesday, up from $82.25 late Tuesday. Gold was quoted at $2,362.40 an ounce, higher against USDD2,351.24.

The shares have performed strongly over the last week ahead of the results, inviting some profit taking today with a fall of 4% to 32.1p, but that still leaves them around 13% higher over the period. DEMAND REMAINS RESILIENT  for the 26 weeks to the end of March increased by 5.2% to £428 million with good momentum seen across food and drink sales while continued progress on cost efficiency saw a 1.7% improvement in the underlying operating margin to 12.3%. The business appears to be benefiting from the positioning of its estate with over 90% of pubs situated within local communities and surrounding suburbs. Cash generation was strong, with operating cashflow up 30% to £90.9 million. After deducting interest and capital expenditures and receiving £9.6 million in disposal proceeds, net cash flow in the half increased to £30.5 million from £11.5 million in 2023. This allowed further progress against the company’s debt reduction strategy with net debt falling by £24.5 million to £1.16 billion which is encouraging given the seasonally-weaker first half. WHAT DID THE CEO SAY? Chief executive Justin Platt commented: ‘Reflecting on my first few months with Marston's, I am very excited by the potential that lies ahead. The UK pub market offers significant value-driving opportunities for those who can engage and deliver for their guests. ‘With our high-quality estate and guest-obsessed team we are well-placed to capitalise and deliver consistent, reliable cashflows that will drive value for our shareholders.’ Momentum has continued into the second half with like-for-like sales excluding the impact of the additional May bank holiday in 2023 up 5.3% over the last six weeks. Platt told  Shares  the business is well positioned to capitalise on the major sporting events scheduled this summer including the Euro football championships with both England and Scotland in action. Shore Capital’s Greg Johnson maintained his 2024 earnings forecasts but conceded there was scope for upgrades. ‘Were current trends to continue and the sun to shine, we see scope to nudge our numbers up later in the year’, said Johnson. Liberum analysts also maintained their full year forecasts, noting: ‘These H1 results put the business on track to meet our FY24E forecasts for operating profit (excluding joint ventures) of £139.2m and pre-tax profit (including joint ventures) of £55.2m with a usual one third, two thirds split between to two halves.’ You can opt out at any time."},

Shares in the washing machines-to-smartphones seller sparked up 9.5% to 71.5p after Currys bumped up guidance for the third time this year following a ‘strong finish’ to the year ended 27 April 2024. Self-help measures under CEO Alex Baldock’s stewardship are paying off for Currys and significantly, the shares are now trading above recent suitor Elliott’s top bid of 67p and the 60.1p at which  Shares  highlighted the retailer’s recovery   in March. LIKE-FOR-LIKES BACK IN GROWTH In a short update which charged up the share price, the FTSE 250 tech products purveyor said group like-for-like sales returned to growth in the 16 weeks to 27 April. As a result, adjusted pre-tax profit for the year to April 2024, stripping out the recently-sold Greece business, is expected to come in between £115 million and £120 million, ahead of previous guidance of ‘at least £105 million’. The upgrade was driven by improving trading momentum with like-for-like sales in positive territory in the UK & Ireland and also the Nordics, where   trades as Elkjøp and adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) more than doubled year-on-year to come in ahead of the £51 million consensus estimate. Currys’ balance sheet is also in better shape than expected, with management now guiding to year-end net cash (excluding leases and pension) of around £95 million. WELL SET UP FOR YEAR AHEAD ‘Our performance is strengthening,’ insisted Baldock, ‘with good momentum in the UK & Ireland, and with the Nordics getting back on track. Sales are now growing again, margins are benefiting from higher customer adoption of solutions and services, and cost discipline is good. All this means improved profits and, with our strong cash position, we’re well set up for the year ahead.’ Liberum Capital, which is bullish on Currys with a 135p price target, upgraded its full-year 2024 pre-tax profit forecast by 11%, from £106 million to £117 million. The broker said the move into positive like-for-like territory in both the UK & Ireland and Nordics in recent weeks is ‘good news. While this admittedly comes against weaker comparatives in full-year 2023, there are signs that the macro pictures in the group’s core territories are turning a corner.’ AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould observed that Currys is showing ‘real signs’ of recovery, with the recent momentum in its UK and Ireland business finally being matched by a Nordics arm being turned around by a new leadership team. ‘After benefiting from the pull-forward of spend on TVs, laptops, printers and household appliances engendered by the pandemic, the post-Covid backdrop has been tougher for Currys,’ explained Mould. ‘Persistent inflation and rising rates have put the squeeze on consumers’ discretionary spending, and the Scandinavian business, a previously reliable contributor, going wrong only compounded matters.’ Mould continued: ‘Currys deserves some credit for digging itself out of this hole and is really playing into its role as a provider of accompanying services alongside the sale of consumer electronics. This is logical as many people are not hugely tech savvy and if Currys can make itself a trusted provider of expertise and support it could drive customer loyalty and useful ancillary revenue. ‘The company still remains at the whim of consumer demand but with the sale of its Greek operations helping to put it in a net cash position, Currys is well positioned for anything the economy might throw at it.’ DISCLAIMER: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in this article owns Shares magazine.

Investors also had a trade war worries to contend with, as the US slapped tariffs on billions worth of Chinese imports, including in the electric vehicle and chip spaces. The FTSE 100 index rose 13.14 points, 0.2%, at 8,428.13. The FTSE 250 added 58.18 points, 0.3%, at 20,618.52, and the AIM All-Share rose 3.07 points, 0.4%, at 789.73. The Cboe UK 100 rose 0.2% to 841.96, the Cboe UK 250 also added 0.2% at 17,913.43, and the Cboe Small Companies climbed 0.6% to 16,125.75. In European equities on Tuesday, the CAC 40 in Paris ended up 0.2% while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt fell 0.1%. Sterling was quoted at $1.2582 at the time of the London equities close Tuesday, up from $1.2552 on Monday. The euro traded at $1.0818, up from $1.0791 late Monday. Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at JP¥156.41, up from JP¥156.21. Lifting sentiment in London, the Bank of England’s top economist has boosted hopes of lower borrowing costs after saying it is ‘not unreasonable’ to expect the bank to consider cutting interest rates over the summer. Huw Pill, the BoE’s chief economist, told an online event organised by the accountancy body ICAEW that the bank could consider cutting rates if inflation continues to ease off. Pill said: ‘I think it’s not unreasonable to believe that through the summer we will begin to see enough confidence in the decline in persistence that bank rate will come into consideration.’ BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said last week that a rate cut in June could not be ‘ruled out’, although he stressed it was not a ‘fait accompli’. His comments came as the bank held rates at 5.25%, keeping them at the highest level since 2008, but were widely seen as strengthening the case for a cut. Pill said the UK jobs market was still tight by historical standards, even though latest official data also out Tuesday showed the unemployment rate rising to its highest for nearly a year, at 4.3% in the three months to March. According to the Office for National Statistics, the UK unemployment rate in the three months to March ticked up to 4.3% from 4.2% in the three months to February. The reading landed in line with FXStreet-cited market consensus. The ONS said average earnings excluding bonuses rose 6.0% on-year in the period, matching the pace of growth in the three months to February. Including bonuses, wages increased 5.7%, also matching the prior month, which was revised upwards from 5.6%. Market consensus had been anticipating a rise of just 5.3%. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at the time of the London equities close. The S&P 500 was up 0.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.4%. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that hot US inflation data has lowered his level of confidence that price rises will slow back down towards the bank’s long-term target. ‘The first quarter in the US was notable for its lack of further progress on inflation,’ the head of the US central bank said during an event in the Netherlands that was streamed online. ‘We did not expect this to be a smooth road, but these were higher than I think anybody expected,’ he continued. ‘And so what that has told us is we’ll need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work.’ US producer price inflation picked up in April, as expected. US producer prices rose by 2.2% on-year in April, in line with expectations, after a 1.8% climb in March. On a monthly basis, prices rose by 0.5% in April from March, following a 0.1% fall in March from February and beating expectations of a 0.3% rise. Eyes now turn to Wednesday’s consumer price index data at 1330 BST. Pepperstone analyst Michael Brown commented: ‘’Inflation week’ as some have dubbed it, has so far seen 2 out of 2 hotter than expected prints, likely leaving the market positioned in a hawkish manner ahead of the all-important US CPI report tomorrow. Firstly, on Monday, the latest survey of consumer expectations from the New York Fed pointed to a noticeable uptick in both short-, and longer-run metrics... Secondly, PPI, which came in hotter. ‘Risks to the April CPI figure appear to be relatively evenly balanced. While energy prices, driven primarily by gasoline, continued to rise on the month, food inflation was a touch soft, and used car prices also notched a relatively significant decline. Nonetheless, with the year-on-year headline CPI metric having surprised to the upside of consensus expectations for three straight months, plenty will be expecting another such beat of the 3.4% median expectation.’ The US is hiking tariffs on $18 billion worth of Chinese imports, targeting strategic sectors like electric vehicles, batteries, steel and critical minerals, the White House said. The decision – which drew a fiery response from Beijing – comes as President Joe Biden gears up for a re-run of his 2020 contest with Republican rival Donald Trump in November’s election, with officials criticizing Trump’s record on trade as they made the announcement. The tariff rate on EVs is set to quadruple to 100% this year, while the tariff for semiconductors will surge from 25% to 50% by next year, the White House said. The action is aimed at encouraging China to ‘eliminate its unfair trade practices regarding technology transfer, intellectual property and innovation,’ it added. In London, Vodafone rose 4.7% after reporting a return to growth in Germany, as it delivered full-year results slightly ahead of its expectations. The Newbury, Berkshire-based telecommunications provider said pretax profit fell 88% to €1.62 billion in the financial year that ended March 31 from €13.07 billion the year prior. Vodafone said this primarily reflects business disposals in the prior financial year, in particular the €8.6 billion gain on the disposal of Vantage Towers. Revenue declined by 2.5% to €36.72 billion from €37.67 billion a year prior. Chief Executive Margherita Della Valle said Vodafone was ‘delivering growth in all of our markets across Europe and Africa.’ She said the performance was ‘slightly ahead of expectations’ but stressed ‘much more still needs to be done.’ Currys surged 7.9%. The electricals retailer raised full-year profit guidance after a reporting like-for-like sales returned to growth in the 16 weeks to April 27. As a result, Currys expects full-year adjusted pretax profit will be £115 million to £120 million, up from guidance of at least £105 million before. Chief Executive Alex Baldock said: ‘Our performance is strengthening, with good momentum in the UK&I, and with the Nordics getting back on track. Sales are now growing again, margins are benefiting from higher customer adoption of solutions and services, and cost discipline is good. All this means improved profits and, with our strong cash position, we’re well set up for the year ahead.’ On the Beach Group fell 14%. It said it expects to deliver ‘another record summer’, despite slower growth in the ‘value’ end of the travel market. The Manchester, England-based beach holidays retailer also declared its first dividend since the Covid-19 pandemic, as it had guided back in December. On The Beach reported pretax profit of £600,000 for the six months that ended March 31, swinging from a £5.9 million loss a year prior. Revenue rose 11% to £80.8 million from £72.9 million, with booked total transaction value up 22% to £597.8 million from £491.7 million. It said the premium market continues to perform strongly with total transaction value growth in 5 star holidays within the business-to-consumer segment of 41% on-year. But the value market remains ‘more challenging’, reflecting cost of living pressures in the UK, with 1% TTV growth on-year. The company declared an interim dividend of 0.90 pence after making no interim payout a year ago. It last paid a dividend before the Covid-19 pandemic, paying out 1.3 pence for the first half of financial 2019. Gold was quoted at $2,351.24 an ounce at late on Tuesday afternoon, higher than $2,333.92 on Monday. Brent oil was trading at $82.25 a barrel, down from $83.07.

{"source_name": "SharesMagazine", "title": "Finding magnificent businesses in the UK", "published_date": "14 May 2024, 11:04", "title_link": "https://www.sharesmagazine.co.uk/news/shares/finding-magnificent-businesses-in-the-uk", "Description": "I was appointed portfolio manager of Edinburgh Investment Trust earlier this year but I have been managing UK equity portfolios for over two decades and there have been a multitude of major market, economic and political cycles over this period. These have included the internet boom and then bust, Global Financial Crisis, Brexit, Covid and many mini-cycles in between. This is one of the reasons why we believe it is important to have a pragmatic investment style. This leads us to spending the vast majority of our time on bottom-up stock picking –  it is where we believe we have an edge. In practice, this means searching for companies with an advantage, an economic moat as we like to call it, ideally operating in industries where there is a structural growth tailwind. What gets us excited are companies with high returns on capital and the ability to sustain those returns. The headwinds for the UK stock market over the last few years have been well documented: But there are now reasons to be more optimistic about the UK economy. First, the gap with Europe has narrowed for GDP growth forecasts. While the US is still a little ahead of the UK, we are no longer an obvious outlier versus the G7 economies like we were 18 months ago. Second, political risks appear to be receding and again we are no longer an outlier against other countries. Third, the UK is in line with other countries in terms of the rate of inflation. Fourth, corporate balance sheets are in good health and UK consumers have saved relatively more of their Covid tailwind than in other countries. These factors combined mean the valuation gap between UK stocks in aggregate and other leading equity markets looks stark and unwarranted. Over time, this valuation gap is likely to close. There is also a perception that the UK market is essentially made up of low growth and lower quality businesses; we strongly disagree with this. There are many world class businesses trading on attractive valuations listed in the UK. The UK stock market is global in nature; in fact, it is more global than most markets. The returns for businesses across the market are comparable with other stock markets, certainly against Europe. While we may not have the Magnificent Seven stocks (Meta, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Tesla), there are magnificent businesses listed in the UK. It is possible to build a well-diversified portfolio of advantaged businesses with high returns and good growth prospects at a discounted valuation. These include: Compass  – a global catering business, highly regarded, well known to be the best run catering business. It is a market share winner. Ashtead   – one of the market leaders in equipment hire in the US, a great business with high returns. Again, it is a market share winner on a very reasonable valuation. Autotrader   – while this business is not global, it has the best in class business model for car internet platforms. If you talk to any competitor, they will say they aspire to becoming an Autotrader. The company has great margins, pricing power and a moat to protect returns. Dunelm  – again not a global company but it is a brilliantly run domestic retailer with a model that is not easy to replicate and is differentiated through its supply chain. It is a market share winner on a very reasonable valuation and with an attractive dividend yield. 3i  – this is a home grown private equity business that owns Action, the largest European discount retailer, which has been a big winner for 3i and is well set to continue to drive great returns. There are some key themes within the Edinburgh Investment Trust portfolio. One is data analytics. The value of data when you add analytics and AI (artificial intelligence) is increasingly important for businesses, consumers and the government. We have been increasing exposure to this theme; the holdings include: LSEG   – owner of much more than just the London Stock Exchange. It is a global business, well diversified, has mostly recurring revenue and 50% + margins. Verisk  – a US-listed data business for insurance, with high margins and return on capital. This is a good example of a company where we are using our 20% allocation to non-UK listed shares. Admiral   – a very well run insurance business that is a second order beneficiary of data. The company is using data and analytics to make better decisions in pricing insurance risk. As always, the focus for us remains on the bottom up and constructing a high conviction portfolio of advantaged businesses that can perform whatever the economic weather. From a macroeconomic perspective we are mindful of changing expectations for the path of interest rate normalisation as inflation has remained more entrenched than expected. This period of heightened monetary policy uncertainty coincides with a period of elevated geopolitical risks we have seen materialise more recently – making a flexible, pragmatic approach to investing important, in our view. Looking forward we expect risks to remain high, with 2024 seeing a significant number of elections globally – in countries accounting for >50% global GDP and >50% population – mostly notably the US, India, and the UK; and China continues to face growth headwinds as the economy seeks to transition from an investment led to a more balanced model with consumption led growth. With consumer confidence in China intimately tied to the property market, this transition is unlikely to be smooth. With the elevated uncertainty across a range of factors, our focus remains on owning businesses with structural growth tailwinds, those that are market share winners or where there is an element of self-help to drive profit growth. Our confidence in the portfolio comes from owning strong businesses, run by smart management teams executing on their business plans to drive total shareholder returns.

The FTSE 100 index opened up 9.70 points, 0.1%, at 8,425.78. The FTSE 250 was up 20.22 points, 0.1%, at 20,580.56, and the AIM All-Share was down 1.15 points, 0.2%, at 785.11. The Cboe UK 100 was up 0.2% at 841.67, the Cboe UK 250 was up 0.1% at 17897.03, and the Cboe Small Companies little changed at 16035.29. In European equities on Tuesday, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 0.1%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was down 0.2%. The UK unemployment rate edged up slightly in the three months to March, official data showed on Tuesday, while wage growth came in hotter than expected. According to the Office for National Statistics, the nation’s unemployment rate in the three months to March ticked up to 4.3% from 4.2% in the three months to February. The reading landed in line with FXStreet-cited market consensus. The ONS said average earnings excluding bonuses rose 6.0% on-year in the period, matching the pace of growth in the three months to February. Including bonuses, wages increased 5.7%, also matching the prior month, which was revised upwards from 5.6%. Market consensus had been anticipating a rise of just 5.3%. ING’s James Smith said the main takeaway from the figures was that the UK jobs market ‘is cooling and that’s gradually translating into lower wage growth.’ He said the softer jobs data appears to be resulting in some gradual decline in wage growth even though the headline regular pay measure came in a tad above consensus. Smith explained this appears to be accounted for by the public sector, which the Bank of England has signalled is of ‘lesser significance to monetary policy decisions right now.’ He believes next week’s services inflation figures are going to be the ‘single most important determinant’ of whether the BoE cuts rates in June. He thinks while services CPI will fall back on-year the risk is that this fall will be ‘slightly less dramatic’ than the BoE expects. ‘If we’re right, then that slightly favours August over June as the start date for rate cuts. But in all honesty, we think it’s looking pretty 50-50 right now.’ The pound was quoted at $1.2519 early on Tuesday in London, down from $1.2552 at the equities close on Monday. The euro stood at $1.0777, down against $1.0791. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥156.44, up compared to JP¥155.87. In the FTSE 100, Vodafone was the best performing stock, up 3.4%. In the year to March, the telco said revenue edged down 2.5% year-on-year to €36.72 billion from €37.67 billion. Pretax profit plunged to €3.67 billion from €14.45 billion, primarily reflecting gains on disposals seen in the prior year, in particular the €8.6 billion from the sale of Vantage Towers. But Vodafone highlighted a return to growth in Germany as it said it was ‘delivering growth in all of our markets across Europe and Africa.’ Chief Executive Margherita Della Valle said: ‘We performed slightly ahead of expectations in the financial year,’ but added that ‘much more still needs to be done in the year ahead.’ Leading the fallers was DCC, down 4.3%. The distribution group reported a 9.6% drop in revenue while pretax profit edged 1.8% lower in the year ending March. Revenue in DCC Energy was £14.2 billion, a decrease of 12% on-year, reflecting the lower wholesale cost of energy commodities during the year. DCC Healthcare recorded revenue of £859.4 million, up 4.6% on-year driven by the acquisition of Medi-Globe completed in September 2023. Anglo American eased 1.3% as it unveiled a new ‘radical’ strategy that will see it keep copper and iron ore assets, while getting rid of platinum and diamond businesses. The move, which follows a ‘comprehensive asset review’, comes a day after the London-based mining company rebuffed a sweetened offer from BHP Group, its major peer. To unlock shareholder value and to simplify its portfolio, Anglo American said on Tuesday said it intends to ‘demerge’ Anglo American Platinum Ltd and also ‘divest’ or ‘demerge’ De Beers as part of its new strategy. The diversified miner also wants to divest its steelmaking coal business, saying it is already responding to ‘strong’ buyer interest. It is also exploring options for care and maintenance and divestment of its nickel operations. In the FTSE 250, Currys soared 9.0%, helping pull AO World 5.6% higher. The electricals retailer raised full-year profit guidance after a reporting like-for-like sales returned to growth in the 16 weeks to April 27. As a result, Currys expects full-year adjusted pretax profit will be £115 million to £120 million, up from guidance of at least £105 million before. Chief Executive Alex Baldock said: ‘Our performance is strengthening, with good momentum in the UK&I, and with the Nordics getting back on track. Sales are now growing again, margins are benefiting from higher customer adoption of solutions and services, and cost discipline is good. All this means improved profits and, with our strong cash position, we’re well set up for the year ahead.’ But bakery chain Greggs, famous for its sausage rolls, fell 1.0% despite stating its expectations for its full year remain unchanged after seeing good progress in 2024. In the first 19 weeks of the year, Greggs said like-for-like sales in company-managed shops were up 7.4% on the prior year, seeing growth across all channels. Sales totalled £693 million, up from £609 million a year before. It remains confident in 140 to 160 net shop openings for the full year. Elsewhere, Headlam dropped 9.1% after warning it expects to report a ‘significant’ pre-tax loss in the first half. Headlam said revenue in the four months to April was down 12% and that sales in April did not show the expected seasonal uplift usually seen. In Asia on Tuesday, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo closed up 0.5%. In China, the Shanghai Composite was down 0.1%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was down 0.2%. The S&P/ASX 200 in Sydney closed down 0.3%. In the US on Monday, Wall Street ended mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.2%, the S&P 500 flat and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.3%. The main focal point for investors this week will be Wednesday’s US inflation figures, which will likely inform market expectations of potential US interest rate cuts. According to FXStreet-cited consensus, consumer prices are expected to have risen 3.4% annually in April, cooling slightly from 3.5% in March. Markets will also hear from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday. Brent oil was quoted at $83.16 a barrel early in London on Tuesday, down from $83.66 late Monday.

It must therefore be rather pleasing when events conspire to allow a profitable early partial exit. That seems to be the case for Elliott Investment Management after the investor revealed it has roughly halved its position in  Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust  ( )  to under 5% of total outstanding shares after the market close on 10 May only months after building up its stake. The Baillie Gifford-managed trust, known for taking long-term bets on what its managers believe are exceptional growth companies, announced a £1 billion share buyback (15 March) to address the trust’s deep discount to NAV (net asset value). As part of the programme the trust conducted a 35 million share   at 895p (8 May). Analysts at Stifel believe the vast majority or perhaps all of the shares were bought from Elliott. LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK Stifel said Elliott started accumulating a position in the summer of 2023 when the shares traded at between 640p and 700p, representing a discount to NAV in excess of 20%. At the middle of the range, this implies Elliott has locked-in a 34% profit as the discount to NAV has shrunk to approximately 6% based on the most recent NAV of 950p. Stifel analyst Iain Scouller commented: ‘This appears to be Elliott realising some sizeable profits, but at the same time they remain one of the largest shareholders and they are likely to continue to give the board clear views as to how shareholder value could be enhanced in the future and keep their ‘feet to the fire’. ‘We assume that if any other shareholders also want to exit a large or small position in Scottish Mortgage’s shares in the market into the buyback, the board will be quite happy to facilitate this in the same way that they have accommodated Elliott’s realisation.’ AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould asks: ‘Is this the shortest activist investor campaign in history? Less than two months after declaring a 5% stake in Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, Elliott has started to sell down its holding. ‘Whereas some previous activist campaigns against investment trusts have had a long list of demands, such as the ones around Alliance Trust, it’s fair to say that Scottish Mortgage was a much simpler one to comprehend. Do something to narrow the discount to net asset value and sell some of its private holdings as it might get a better price than was attributed by the market.’ Disclaimer: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in the article owns Shares magazine.

The FTSE 100 index ended down 18.77 points, 0.2%, at 8,414.99. It ends a six-day win streak for the large-cap index. The FTSE 250 closed down 85.04 points, 0.3%, at 20,560.34, and the AIM All-Share ended down 3.21 points, 0.4%, at 786.66. The Cboe UK 100 lost 0.4% at 840.35, the Cboe UK 250 fell 0.3% to 17,879.69, and the Cboe Small Companies gave back 0.6% at 16,036.69. In European equities on Monday, the CAC 40 in Paris fell 0.1% and the DAX 40 in Frankfurt ended down 0.2%. Sterling was quoted at $1.2552 late Monday afternoon, higher than $1.2513 at the London equities close on Friday. The euro traded at $1.0791, up from $1.0769 late Friday. Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at JP¥156.21 up from JP¥155.87. According to FXStreet cited consensus, the US inflation rate is expected to have ebbed to 3.4% in April, from 3.5% in March. A hotter-than-expected reading, however, could support the dollar. ‘The BoE and ECB seem on course to ease in June but another firm inflation print in the US looks set to keep the Fed higher for longer,’ analysts at Barclays commented. ‘We expect a firm print, with core CPI decelerating only slightly to 0.34% month-on-month. We retain our baseline of a single rate cut from the Fed this year, no sooner than September, with December almost as likely. The final euro-area inflation print for April (Friday) should strengthen the case for a June cut from the ECB.’ The US central bank should keep interest rates at their current ‘restrictive’ levels until it sees real progress in the fight to lower inflation, a senior Fed official said Monday. ‘In light of the attenuation in progress in terms of getting inflation down to our target, it is appropriate that we maintain the policy rates in restrictive territory, which it is right now,’ Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson said at an event in Cleveland, Ohio. ‘We continue to look for additional evidence that inflation is going to return to our 2% target,’ he said, adding that ‘until we have that, I think it is appropriate to keep the policy rate in restrictive territory.’ Jefferson’s comments on Monday echo those of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who told reporters in early May that ‘it is likely that gaining such greater confidence will take longer than previously expected.’ In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded a touch lower at the time of the European equities close. The S&P 500 was down 0.1%, though the Nasdaq Composite was 0.2% higher. In the FTSE 100, Anglo American lost 2.4%. It said the latest bid proposal from mining peer BHP Group continues to ‘significantly undervalue’ it and its ‘future prospects.’ Anglo American Chair Stuart Chambers said: ‘The latest proposal from BHP again fails to recognise the value inherent in Anglo American.’ He said Anglo American shareholders are ‘well positioned’ to benefit from increasing demand from future enabling products while the increasing capital intensity to bring greenfield supply online makes proven assets with world class resource endowments ever more attractive. He said the BHP proposal also continues to have a ‘highly unattractive structure.’ Earlier Monday, BHP confirmed it made an improved offer to buy Anglo American last week, but said the offer was rejected by the Anglo board on Monday. The new all-share offer from Melbourne-based BHP values London-based Anglo at £34 billion, up from £31.1 billion under its previous offer. BHP is offering 0.813 of a BHP share for each Anglo share, giving a current value to Anglo shares of £27.53 each, based on BHP’s own price. The revised proposal represents a 15% improvement in the merger exchange ratio, BHP noted. It increases the holding that Anglo shareholders would have in the combined entity to 16.6% from 14.8% previously. BHP also offered Anglo two positions of the board of the combined company. BHP shares closed down 0.5%. Diploma shares climbed 4.1%. The London-based supplier of specialised technical products impressed analysts with better-than-expected half-year results, which prompted an increase to annual guidance. Diploma now expects constant-currency revenue growth of 16% for all of financial 2024, which ends on September 30, up 0.5% from the company’s previous guidance. Diploma also anticipates an improved operating margin of 20.5%, an increase of 0.8 percentage points from its previous forecast, as well as EPS growth of 15%. The improved outlook came as Diploma reported pretax profit of £77.8 million for the six months that ended March 31, down 1.1% from £78.7 million a year before. Revenue was £638.3 million, up 9.5% from £582.8 million. Elsewhere in London, tracking and monitoring systems provider t42 IoT Tracking Solutions jumped 54%. It secured a $4.5 million deal to provide 30,000 monitoring systems to a ‘leading company in Brazil within the transportation and logistics security tracking sector’. The deal is three years long. t42 added: ‘Under the agreement, following acceptance by the client of the system development, the client is due to place an initial order with t42 for 10,000 tracking units, with a non-refundable deposit payment having been received by the company. Revenues from the initial order, once placed, are expected to be received commencing in FY 2024.’ Gold was quoted at $2,333.92 an ounce at the time of the London equities close Monday, lower than $2,362.94 at the same time on Friday. Brent oil was trading at $83.07 a barrel, lower than $83.66 late Friday. Tuesday’s economic calendar has a UK unemployment reading at 0700 BST, before US producer price index data at 1330 BST.

The FTSE 100 index was up 7.05 points, 0.1%, at 8,440.61. The FTSE 250 was down 33.65 points, 0.2%, at 20,611.59, and the AIM All-Share was down 0.45 points, 0.1%, at 789.42. The Cboe UK 100 was down 0.1% at 843.51, the Cboe UK 250 was down 0.2% at 17,896.72, and the Cboe Small Companies was up 0.1% at 16,124.94. In European equities on Monday, the CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX 40 in Frankfurt were down 0.2%. Reuters reported Shein will press ahead with a London float, dodging regulatory hurdles that stemmed from a possible New York listing. The fast fashion retailer plans to tell China’s securities watchdog of its intention to change its initial public offering venue to the London Stock Exchange, Reuters reported, citing a person with knowledge of the matter. It can file with the LSE as soon as this month. Reports have suggested Shein could be valued at as much as $66 billion, around £53 billion. It would be a welcome tonic for the London market which has seen the IPO market stall and witnessed a number of high profile departures. Meanwhile, the Times reported UK computer company Raspberry Pi is also finalising a plan to list in London. The float may take place in the next ten days, though could be delayed if market conditions weaken. It could value Raspberry Pi at about £500 million. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell said: ‘Shein is such a big name in the world of retail that its mere presence on the London market could encourage others to look hard at the UK as a listing venue.’ ‘It is now a household name in many parts of the world and that‘s what many investors love to see when picking stocks.’ Coatsworth noted while Raspberry Pi would be a ‘much smaller float’ it would still be ‘significant’ as it brings a well-known name in the technology sector to the UK market. ‘The UK is woefully under-represented in technology companies despite the country brimming with tech talent. We need a few more tech firms to list in the UK and give investors more domestic choice rather than them simply having to fish around the US market for tech opportunities.’ The main focal point for investors this week will be Wednesday’s US inflation figures, which will likely inform market expectations of potential US interest rate cuts. According to FXStreet-cited consensus, consumer prices are expected to have risen 3.4% annually in April, cooling slightly from 3.5% in March. US producer prices data on Tuesday and retail sales numbers on Wednesday add to an important week of economic releases across the pond. Stocks in New York were called modestly higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was called up 0.1%, the S&P 500 index up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.2%. Sterling was quoted at $1.2523 at midday on Monday, higher than $1.2513 at the London equities close on Friday. The euro traded at $1.0781 at midday on Monday, up from $1.0769 late Friday.

The improved outlook came as Diploma reported pretax profit of £77.8 million for the six months that ended March 31, down 1.1% from £78.7 million a year before. Revenue was £638.3 million, up 9.5% from £582.8 million. Stifel said the results were ‘good,’ with revenue and adjusted operating profit around 1% ahead of consensus. The broker noted all divisions delivered organic growth, with Controls ‘the standout’. ‘We are buyers at the current valuation and see upside from further compound growth and strong delivery against financial targets. The group’s clear strategy and trading resilience provide confidence in the growth trajectory,’ Stifel said. British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group rose 2.1%, extending Friday’s gains which followed well received first quarter results. But BAE Systems fell 2.7%, after Bank of America downgraded the stock to ’neutral’ from ’buy’. It is, however, up 21% in the year-to-date. Phoenix Group fell 2.5% after announcing Chief Financial Officer, Rakesh Thakrar will step down during 2024. Phoenix said former Non-Executive Director Stephanie Bruce will return in June as interim chief financial officer, while it begins the formal process to find Thakrar’s permanent successor. In the FTSE 250, John Wood rose 3.7%. Last week, the Aberdeen, Scotland-based consulting and engineering company, rejected a 205 pence per share offer from Sidara. Sidara is the trading name of Dar Al-Handasah Consultants Shair and Partners Holdings, a planning, design, engineering and project management firm, founded in Beirut, with more than 300 offices in 60 countries. On AIM in London, MediaZest soared 67% after reporting trading for the six months ended March 31 has been encouraging, with momentum continuing into the second half of the financial year. The Surrey, England-based audiovisual solutions provider also said it had won a series of new orders in recent weeks from a wide range of customers worth in excess of £350,000. Mission Group rose 5.2% after confirming receipt of an unsolicited conditional takeover proposal from digital advertising and technology company Brave Bison Group. Mission said Brave Bison’s potential offer was for an all-share offer at an exchange ratio of 11.5 Brave Bison shares for each share in Mission. Mission said its board unanimously rejected the possible offer last week, terming it ‘opportunistic’ and as significantly undervaluing the company. Brave Bison, which fell 1.1%, said it believes an enlarged company would ‘present a more attractive investment opportunity to institutional shareholders than either standalone company.’ Gold was quoted at $2,342.47 an ounce at midday on Monday, lower than $2,362.94 on Friday.

POSITIVE FIRST-HALF PERFORMANCE Diploma operates three divisions: Controls, which supplies components including specialised wiring, Seals and Life Sciences, which includes consumables and instrumentation. In the six months to the end of March, the firm grew its revenue by 10% to £638 million, with organic growth contributing 5% and acquisitions contributing 8% while foreign exchange moves produced a 3% headwind. Like-for-like sales in Controls rose 7% thanks to market share gains and ‘structural tailwinds’, with the Windy City Wire subsidiary showing strong volume-led growth, while Life Sciences sales were up 5%. Seals sales were up just 1% although the firm expects a stronger second half now the destocking process is past and customers have gone back to their normal patterns of ordering. Diploma made six acquisitions during the period for a total of £284 million, the largest of which – US-based Peerless Aerospace Fastener – cost £236 million but is expected to deliver an 8% increase in group earnings in its first year.

Despite positive news on users and advertisers, the shares have been knocked to the bottom of the FTSE 100 performance table with a loss of 32p or 5.5%. WHAT DID THE COMPANY SAY? Ahead of its AGM (annual general meeting), Rightmove provided an update on trading for the four months to the end of April and confirmed its full-year outlook for revenue and profits. Housing market activity has picked up markedly, with agreed sales in the first four months of 2024 up 17% on the same period last year and prices resuming their upward trend. While higher mortgage rates are impacting first-time buyers, other parts of the market are moving ahead and with buyers and sellers ‘increasingly looking to transact’ the firm sees total UK house sales reaching 1.1 million this year. Meanwhile, the rental market remains extremely busy with average rents rising 7.6% on the same period last year as the firm estimates there is a shortfall of some 50,000 properties compared with 2019. Against this backdrop, consumers are spending over 80% of their time on Rightmove when searching on property portals and are increasingly engaging with the site resulting in a 40% uplift in email leads through the Rightmove app. The number of estate agents using the site has increased by around 250 due to ‘strong agent retention and particular strength in the lettings market’ while independent agent subscriptions to the firm’s Optimiser Edge product are ahead of expectations. However, while the increase in membership numbers is good for revenue and earnings, lettings-only agents have a lower ARPA (average revenue per advertiser) so the firm has   its estimate of  average  growth in ad revenues this year from over £100 to between £75 and £85, and it is this change which traders and analysts have picked up on rather than the positive overall trend and the increase in customer numbers. EXPERT VIEWS AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould observed: ‘Being the market leader creates a virtuous circle for Rightmove. Its site has the most listings and is therefore the one which prospective property buyers will go to when looking for their next home. This reinforces its position as a must-have product for estate agencies and housebuilders. It also gives Rightmove significant pricing power when it comes to securing subscriptions from these customers. ‘However, a shift in the mix of business, with strong growth in the number of lettings agents subscribing to the platform, is affecting the key average revenue per advertiser metric and could imply Rightmove is finding it harder to secure new customers or upsell existing users in the new-build and traditional estate agent markets’, added Mould. ‘While the increase in agency numbers is a clear positive for the group, the statement notes the dilutive ARPA impact of new lettings only agents, particularly those with lower stock’, said Numis analyst Gareth Davies. ‘Although mix shifts a little, reflecting the higher customer numbers at lower ARPA, we make no change to our headline estimates,’ continued Davies. ‘At a free cash flow yield of almost 5% we see Rightmove’s valuation as attractive and continue to believe the market is overstating the risk to the group as a result of CoStar’s acquisition of OnTheMarket. We reiterate our BUY and 695p target.’ Disclaimer: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in this article owns Shares magazine.

The FTSE 100 index opened up 9.34 points, 0.1%, at 8,441.86. The FTSE 250 was up 14.63 points, 0.1%, at 20,660.01, and the AIM All-Share was up 4.37 points, 0.1%, at 4,590.66. The Cboe UK 100 was flat at 843.82, the Cboe UK 250 was up marginally at 17941.39, and the Cboe Small Companies was up 0.2% at 16146.68. In European equities on Monday, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 0.1%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was up 0.1%. The main focal point for investors this week will be Wednesday’s US inflation figures, which will likely inform market expectations of potential US interest rate cuts. According to FXStreet-cited consensus, consumer prices are expected to have risen 3.4% annually in April, cooling slightly from 3.5% in March. Markets will also hear from from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday and Vice Chair Philip Jefferson on Monday. The pound was quoted at $1.2525 early on Monday in London, compared to $1.2513 at the equities close on Friday. The euro stood at $1.0771, against $1.0769. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥155.87, down compared to JP¥155.87. In the FTSE 100, Diploma soared 7.1% after upgrading its annual guidance as it reported a strong set of half-year results. The specialised technical products and services provider said revenue grew 9.5% annually to £638.3 million in the six months to March 31, from £582.8 million a year before. Pretax profit edged lower to £77.8 million from £78.7 million. For its full financial year, Diploma now expects constant currency revenue growth of 16% or so, with 6% organic growth and 10% to come from acquisitions. It also expects its operating margin to improve to 20.5%, having previously guided for it to be in line with financial 2023 at 19.7%. ‘We’ve delivered another strong first half with good volume-led organic growth in a more challenging market environment. Our momentum is encouraging going into the second half, underpinning our upgrade to full year guidance,’ said Chief Executive Johnny Thomson. Leading the fallers was BAE Systems, down 2.1%, after Bank of America downgraded the stock to ’neutral’ from ’buy’. Anglo American rose 0.1%. Bloomberg reported shareholders are pushing the company to speed up the release of its turnaround plan as the 107-year-old miner seeks to present an alternative to BHP Group Ltd‘s takeover bid. Anglo has been reviewing its business since mid-2023, looking at every mine in its portfolio to help reshape a company that’s fallen behind competitors in recent years, the report noted. Anglo may unveil the strategy as soon as the coming week, Bloomberg suggested, when the world‘s top mining bosses attend Bank of America’s annual conference in Miami. In the FTSE 250, Victrex fell 3.0% after reporting a weaker performance in its interim period to March 31. The high-performance polymer supplier said revenue fell 14% year-on-year to £139.3 million from £162.2 million, as sales volumes dropped 11% to 1,737 tonnes. Pretax profit plunged 92% to £3.3 million from £39.1 million, as margins took a hit from high inventory levels and recent industry destocking amongst medical device customers, and lower asset utilisation. On London’s AIM market, Mission Group rose 5.6% after confirming receipt of an unsolicited conditional takeover proposal from digital advertising and technology company and fellow AIM-listing Brave Bison Group. Brave Bison fell 2.4%. Mission said Brave Bison’s potential offer was for an all-share offer at an exchange ratio of 11.5 Brave Bison shares for each share in Mission. Mission said its board unanimously rejected the possible offer last week, terming it ‘opportunistic’ and as significantly undervaluing the company. In Asia on Monday, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo was down 0.1%. In China, the Shanghai Composite was down 0.2%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was up 0.7%. The S&P/ASX 200 in Sydney closed marginally higher. In the US on Friday, Wall Street ended mostly higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.3%, the S&P 500 up 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite slightly lower. Brent oil was quoted at $82.85 a barrel early in London on Monday, down from $83.66 late Friday. Gold was quoted at $2,350.03 an ounce against $2,362.94. Copyright 2024 Alliance News Ltd.

The FTSE 100 index was up 66.70 points, 0.8%, at 8,448.05, after hitting a record high 8,455.77 earlier. The FTSE 250 was up 163.86 points, 0.8%, at 20,695.16, and the AIM All-Share was up 5.05 points, 0.6%, at 788.75. The Cboe UK 100 was up 0.9% at 844.75, the Cboe UK 250 was up 0.9% at 17,973.70, and the Cboe Small Companies was up 0.3% at 16,089.25. In European equities on Friday, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.9%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was 0.7%. ‘The FTSE 100 is again in the ascendancy as the market hit new all-time highs on Friday. Given its international horizons, this has little to do with the UK’s better-than-expected GDP growth and is largely being driven by strength in the resources space where higher metals prices and the promise of M&A are helping to stoke share prices,’ said AJ Bell analyst Russ Mould. ‘The next key test of the index’s new-found vim and vigour will likely come next week in the form of US inflation figures. Investors have broadly accepted rate cuts won’t be as deep or come as soon as would have been anticipated at the start of the year. However, any signs inflation is proving much more stubborn than predicted would still represent a shock to the system for financial markets.’ US producer price inflation figures come out on Tuesday next week at 1330 BST, followed by consumer price inflation data at the same time on Wednesday next week. Stocks in New York were called higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was called up 0.3%, the S&P 500 index up 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.4%. At its May meeting, the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee voted by a majority of 7 to 2 to maintain bank rate at 5.25%. Two members preferred to reduce the bank rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5.00%. Seven members, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Ben Broadbent, Megan Greene, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine Mann and Huw Pill, voted in favour of the status quo. Swati Dhingra and BoE Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden voted for a cut. The UK economy grew ahead of expectations in March and in the first quarter of 2024, according to numbers on Friday. According to the Office for National Statistics, UK gross domestic product rose by 0.4% in March from February, ahead of FXStreet cited consensus of 0.1% growth. UK GDP had expanded 0.2% on-month in February, according to revised data. In the first quarter of 2024, GDP is estimated to have risen 0.6%, beating expectations of a 0.4% rise and following a 0.3% decline in the fourth quarter of 2023 and a 0.1% decline in the third quarter. Compared with the same quarter a year ago, GDP rose 0.2%. ‘The UK has charged out of what will go down in the history books as the shortest, shallowest recession on record. After months of floundering around a flatline, growth of 0.6% will give the UK economy a real confidence boost. Services and manufacturing have helped offset ongoing challenges being faced by the construction sector,’ said AJ Bell analyst Danni Hewson. ‘Falling inflation and rising wages have given households a bit more in the tank and they’ve upped their spend, something that will need to continue if the trajectory is to be maintained. Andrew Bailey painted a bucolic picture of a recovering economy which will be further boosted by any rate cut tailwinds. But the resilience being demonstrated by most sectors could be seen as a reason for MPC members to keep their finger on the pause button for a little while longer.’ Sterling was quoted at $1.2532 at midday on Friday, higher than $1.2511 at the London equities close on Thursday. The euro traded at $1.0780 at midday on Friday, up from $1.0775 late Thursday. Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at JP¥155.74 versus JP¥155.61. In the FTSE 100, miners were among the best performing stocks, with Glencore up 3.3%, Anglo American up 2.0% and Antofagasta up 1.9%. Gold was quoted at $2,376.77 an ounce at midday on Friday, higher than $2,332.88 on Thursday. British Airways owner IAG rose 0.6%, after it said revenue in the first quarter of 2024 rose to €6.43 billion from €5.89 billion a year earlier. Operating profit multiplied to €68 million from €9 million, while pretax loss narrowed to €87 million from €121 million. ‘Our group benefits from the strength of our core markets - North Atlantic, South Atlantic and intra-Europe - and the performance of our brands. Investment across the group in transformation is delivering encouraging improvements in punctuality and customer experience at our airlines,’ said Chief Executive Officer Luis Gallego. ‘We are well-positioned for the summer. The high demand for travel is a continuing trend. IAG expects non-fuel costs to increase slightly in 2024, reflecting investment. Net debt on March 31 stood at €7.44 billion, down from €9.25 billion a year earlier.’ In the FTSE 250, TBC Bank rose 4.2%. The Tbilisi, Georgia-based lender announced a share buyback programme of up to ₾75 million or £22.4 million, after it reported pretax profit in the first quarter of 2024 rose to ₾343.2 million, or £102.3 million, from ₾296.3 million a year earlier. Total operating income rose to ₾618.0 million from ₾532.2 million, with net interest income up to ₾442.8 million from ₾366.8 million, net fee and commission income up to ₾104.3 million from ₾92.4 million, while other non-interest income ticked down to ₾70.8 million from ₾73.0 million. TBC Bank’s total customer base at March 31 rose to 17.9 million from 13.3 million a year earlier. Looking ahead, Chief Executive Officer Vakhtang Butskhrikidze commented: ‘I believe that the group is well positioned to build further on this strong start to the year and deliver excellent results for our shareholders in 2024, as well as ensuring we are on track to meet our strategic targets for next year. Among London’s small-caps, TT Electronics lost 7.7%. In the four months ended April 30, the electronic component manufacturer said revenue falls 2% on an organic basis from a year earlier, but up 1% excluding the impact of pass-through revenues, which it said continue to reduce. Looking ahead, Chief Executive Officer Peter France commented: ’Whilst there is continuing global macro-economic uncertainty, the outlook for our markets remains good. The significant orderbook coverage and our prompt actions across the business underpin the board’s confidence in an unchanged outlook for the year and the delivery of the 10% operating margin target.‘ On AIM in London, Polarean Imaging gained 36%. The medical imaging technology developer said it received its second de novo order for a new Xenon MRI system from the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital. It expects to install the new system later this year and will collaborate ’closely‘ with the hospital team, as it does with its existing clinical sites, to develop a ’strong‘ Xenon MRI programme. Polarean Imaging said this programme will support clinical imaging, NIH-funded research, and pharmaceutical-sponsored trials, aligning with Polarean’s commitment to advancing medical research and patient care.

A dovish tone from Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey at this week’s (9 May) interest rate policy meeting and today’s (10 May) stronger than expected first quarter GDP reading are creating the UK’s own Goldilocks conditions. Add in the extra spice that UK stocks are unloved and under-owned by global equity managers and the scene is set for further positive performance. BEST PERFORMERS OVER ONE YEAR What a difference a year can make. Twelve months ago, it would have been almost impossible to believe UK stocks would be making new all-time highs today, but how many of the best performers did the average investor pick out? Self-elevating support vessels operator  Gulf Marine Services  ( )  is the best performer in the FTSE All Share over the last year, gaining 345% as the company continues to see ‘robust’ demand for its fleet of vessels and services. Investors love turnaround stories and the transformation at  Rolls-Royce  ( )  has certainly captured investor’s attention with the shares gaining 178% over the last year. Chief executive Tufan Erginbilgiç has engineered a big improvement in how the business operates and taken some bold moves to refocus the group, although not without some pain including 2,500 job cuts. The aircraft engine maker has set itself an ambitious target to double profits by 2027. Another turnaround story which has not garnered anywhere near as much attention but has handsomely rewarded patient investors is private-label cleaning products company  McBride  ( )  which has seen its shares gain 242%. The budget laundry-detergent-to-surface-cleaner manufacturer has been a beneficiary of the cost-of-living crisis which has stocked demand for its affordable products. In the six months to 31 December revenue increased by a tenth driven by price increases as well as volume growth as the company continued to take market share in the private-label market. Software-as-a-service provider to automotive retailers  Pinewood Technologies  ( )  is the former Pendragon group, which sold its motor and leasing operations to North American dealership  Lithia (LAD:NYSE)  for £397 million. The radically transformed group is now a pure-play software-as-a-service business with gross margins approaching 90%, high recurring revenues and much-improved growth prospects on a global scale. In April, the company confirmed its plan to reward shareholders by returning £358 million of capital, equivalent to more than half of its market capitalisation. You can opt out at any time."},

The FTSE 100 index closed up 52.41 points, 0.6%, at 8,433.76, after hitting a record high 8,455.77 earlier. The FTSE 250 ended up 114.08 points, 0.6%, at 20,645.38, and the AIM All-Share ended up 6.17 points, 0.8%, at 789.87. For the week, the FTSE 100 added 2.7%, the FTSE 250 rose 2.4%, while the AIM All-Share also climbed 2.4%. The Cboe UK 100 was up 0.9% at 844.75, the Cboe UK 250 was up 0.9% at 17,973.70, and the Cboe Small Companies was up 0.3% at 16,089.25. In European equities on Friday, the CAC 40 in Paris closed up 0.4%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt added 0.5%. Both the CAC and DAX hit their best levels too. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2% higher, the S&P 500 was flat, though the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1%. SPI Asset Management analyst Stephen Innes commented: ‘For a Federal Reserve already short on justifications for implementing rate cuts, the emergence of ’negative’ news may paradoxically provide some relief. In such a context, a slight downturn in economic indicators could be seen as offering the Fed a more legitimate rationale for adjusting its monetary policy stance.’ Sterling was quoted at $1.2513 late on Friday afternoon, largely flat from $1.2511 at the London equities close on Thursday. The euro traded at $1.0769, down from $1.0775. Against the yen, the dollar rose to JP¥155.87 versus JP¥155.61. Rate cut hope in the UK also lifted equities, following a doveish tinge to the latest Bank of England bank rate hold. The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee on Thursday voted by a majority of 7 to 2 to maintain bank rate at 5.25%. Two members preferred to reduce the bank rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5.00%. Swissquote analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya commented: ‘None of the nine MPC members voted to hike the policy rate yesterday, seven of them voted to maintain it, and two of them voted to cut – as Dave Ramsden opted for an immediate rate cut. And because the committee members has a track record of having followed his view in the past, Mr Ramsden’s vote to cut has been taken as a very strong signal that the BoE will be cutting its rates soon. ‘How soon? Governor Bailey said that the June meeting ’is neither ruled out nor a fait accompli’. We have two sets of inflation and labour data before the next decision, so the expectations will likely swing but in the wake of the BoE meeting, the market gives a 50% for a June cut, and an August cut is seen as a sure thing.’ In London, housebuilders ended higher on the expectation that UK interest rates could soon be cut. Persimmon rose 1.3%, while Taylor Wimpey added 1.1%. Rightmove fell 4.3%. It left its top and bottom line outlook for 2024 unchanged, but lowered its guidance for the average revenue per advertiser metric, amid a ‘recent change in customer mix’. It said its estate agency net memberships have risen by around 250 in the first four months of the year. Rightmove said the rise in memberships is ‘positive for revenue and profit’, though it noted that lettings-only agents usually have a lower average revenue per advertiser. Its new homes offering has seen 90 new developments added to the Access, entry-level package, tailored for housing associations. Similar to the increase in memberships, this is positive for revenue and profit, but has a lower ARPA. Rightmove said that its ARPA growth for the first four months of the year would have been in line with guidance, were it not for a ‘recent change in customer mix’. As a result, ARPA for 2024 is expected to grow in the £75 to £85 range, its guidance lowered from £100 to £110. Mothercare tumbled 19% after it said it was pursuing refinancing options with its senior lender, following a tough financial year in which franchise partner sales were dragged down by weak trading in the Middle East. In a trading update for the 53 weeks to March 30, Mothercare said that retail sales by its franchise partners fell 13% to £281 million from £323 million a year prior. The company specialises in clothes, prams and other children’s essentials. Mothercare added that adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for the year were ‘marginally’ above the £6.7 million delivered in financial 2023. The company said that the Middle Eastern markets, representing around 41% of total retail sales, continued to be challenging over the year. ‘In addition to the global economic uncertainties which are impacting our retail sales, in many of our territories our partners are still clearing inventory due to the suppressed demand during Covid-19,’ Mothercare said. Brent oil was trading at $83.66 a barrel at the time of the London equities close on Friday, slightly higher than $83.62 late Thursday. Gold was quoted at $2,362.94 an ounce late on Friday afternoon, higher than $2,332.88 on Thursday. Monday’s economic calendar is quiet, though there is a Chinese inflation reading due on Saturday.

But the path to a late spring rate cut will have to go through two rounds of inflation and wage data. Big beats in the forthcoming inflation data could further delay the start of a gradual easing cycle, but we think the bar for large hawkish surprises is very high given the tweaks to the bank’s near-term projections. Overall, we continue to expect the MPC to deliver three quarter-point rate cuts this year (75bps) – in line with our long-held view,’ Deutsche Bank analyst Sanjay Raja commented. The Bank of England on Thursday moved a step nearer to a summer interest rate cut, but would not commit on whether this would come as soon as June. ‘The progress we are seeing in the key economic data is encouraging, but we are not yet at the point of cutting interest rates. We need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can do that,’ the BoE said. At a press conference following the decision, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said ‘we are not yet at a point where we can cut bank rate’. Sterling was quoted at $1.2511 late on Thursday afternoon, recovering from some of the weakness it showed immediately after the BoE decision, higher than $1.2495 at the London equities close on Wednesday. Also rising were interest rate sensitive stocks in London. Property portal Rightmove added 1.8%, housebuilder Taylor Wimpey climbed 1.7% and estate agent Foxtons shot up 5.8%. In European equities on Thursday, the CAC 40 in Paris added 0.7%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt surged 1.0%, hitting a record high.

Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at JP¥155.61, up slightly versus JP¥155.55. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5%, the S&P 500 was 0.3% higher and the Nasdaq Composite also added 0.3%. US initial jobless claims increased in the week just gone, coming in ahead of a market forecast, according to numbers on Thursday, suggesting the labour market is cooling. The US Department of Labor said initial unemployment insurance claims totalled 231,000 in the week to May 4, rising from 209,000 a week prior. The prior reading was upwardly revised from 208,000. The latest reading topped the FXStreet-cited market consensus of 210,000. It was also the highest number of initial jobless claims since the week to August 26, when they totalled 234,000. Oxford Economics analyst Nancy Vanden Houten commented: ‘One week’s rise in initial jobless claims doesn’t change our forecast for the Fed to keep policy steady until September. The Fed likely welcomes evidence of a further loosening in labour market conditions, which will contribute to slowing in wage growth and inflation. ‘Unless the labour market weakens substantially, which we don’t expect, changes in Fed policy will be determined almost exclusively by readings on inflation. We think the Fed needs to see a string of reports showing inflation is heading back to a sustainable path toward 2% before lowering interest rates.’ In the FTSE 250, Harbour Energy rose 7.7%. The oil and gas company said first quarter production averaged 172,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down from 202,000 barrels a year earlier. It proposed a final dividend of 13 US cents, up from 12 cents a year earlier, in line with its $200 million annual dividend policy and representing around 9% growth year-on-year. Harbour Energy Chief Executive Officer Linda Cook commented: ‘During the first quarter, we continued to deliver safe and responsible operations, maximise the value of our UK production base and advance our organic growth projects. At the same time, we made significant progress towards completion of the Wintershall Dea acquisition which will transform our portfolio and capital structure and support enhanced and sustainable shareholder returns.’ Among London’s small-caps, Avon Protection rose 4.2%. The personal protection equipment company said it won a contract from the UK Ministry of Defence worth up to £38 million for the continued supply of general service respirator and associated in service support. The contract runs for four years with five further 12-month option periods. Brent oil was trading at $83.62 a barrel late on Thursday, higher than $83.48 late Wednesday.

The FTSE 100 index opened up 43.05 points, 0.5%, at 8,424.40. The FTSE 250 was up 68.41 points, 0.3%, at 20,599.71, and the AIM All-Share was up 2.06 points, 0.3%, at 785.76. The Cboe UK 100 was up 0.6% at 842.48, the Cboe UK 250 was up 0.4% at 17,883.51, and the Cboe Small Companies was down 0.5% at 15,965.01. In European equities on Friday, the CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX 40 in Frankfurt were both up 0.5%. At its May meeting, the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee voted by a majority of 7 to 2 to maintain bank rate at 5.25%. Two members preferred to reduce the bank rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5.00%. Seven members, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Ben Broadbent, Megan Greene, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine Mann and Huw Pill, voted in favour of the status quo. Swati Dhingra and BoE Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden voted for a cut. The UK economy grew ahead of expectations in March and in the first quarter of 2024, according to numbers on Friday. According to the Office for National Statistics, UK GDP rose by 0.4% in March from February, ahead of FXStreet cited consensus of 0.1% growth. UK GDP had expanded 0.2% on-month in February, according to revised data. In the first quarter of 2024, GDP is estimated to have risen 0.6%, beating expectations of a 0.4% rise and following a 0.3% decline in the fourth quarter of 2023 and a 0.1% decline in the third quarter. Compared with the same quarter a year ago, GDP rose 0.2%. ‘The UK economy powered out of its technical recession in the first quarter, judging by the initial GDP figures released today. The economy expanded by a whapping 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. Admittedly the data underlying that number has been pretty volatile. Some of that bounce – and the 0.3% contraction that came before it in the fourth quarter – is linked to a suspiciously large fall in retail activity at the end of last year which was fully recouped in January,’ said ING analyst James Smith. ‘Likewise, GDP increased by 0.4% in March alone, and some of the drivers of that (like hospitality and administration) look more like noise than signal. Some caution should therefore be taken when interpreting these figures, just like the weaker numbers at the end of last year. Still, it tallies with other economic indicators which suggest the economy is entering a period of stronger growth.’ Sterling was quoted at $1.2528 early Friday, higher than $1.2511 at the London equities close on Thursday. The euro traded at $1.0781 early Friday, up from $1.0775 late Thursday. Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at JP¥155.73 versus JP¥155.61. In London’s FTSE 100, miners led the way, with Antofagasta up 2.4%, Glencore up 2.2% and Anglo American up 1.6%. Gold was quoted at $2,366.02 an ounce early Friday, higher than $2,332.88 on Thursday. British Airways owner IAG rose 1.3%, after it said revenue in the first quarter of 2024 rose to €6.43 billion from €5.89 billion a year earlier. Operating profit multiplied to €68 million from €9 million, while pretax loss narrowed to €87 million from €121 million. ‘Our group benefits from the strength of our core markets - North Atlantic, South Atlantic and intra-Europe - and the performance of our brands. Investment across the group in transformation is delivering encouraging improvements in punctuality and customer experience at our airlines,’ said Chief Executive Officer Luis Gallego. ‘We are well-positioned for the summer. The high demand for travel is a continuing trend. IAG expects non-fuel costs to increase slightly in 2024, reflecting investment. Net debt on March 31 stood at €7.44 billion, down from €9.25 billion a year earlier.’ In the FTSE 250, TBC Bank rose 1.2%. The Tbilisi, Georgia-based lender announced a share buyback programme of up to ₾75 million or £22.4 million, after it reported pretax profit in the first quarter of 2024 rose to ₾343.2 million, or £102.3 million, from ₾296.3 million a year earlier. Total operating income rose to ₾618.0 million from ₾532.2 million, with net interest income up to ₾442.8 million from ₾366.8 million, net fee and commission income up to ₾104.3 million from ₾92.4 million, while other non-interest income ticked down to ₾70.8 million from ₾73.0 million. TBC Bank’s total customer base at March 31 rose to 17.9 million from 13.3 million a year earlier. Looking ahead, Chief Executive Officer Vakhtang Butskhrikidze commented: ‘I believe that the group is well positioned to build further on this strong start to the year and deliver excellent results for our shareholders in 2024, as well as ensuring we are on track to meet our strategic targets for next year. Elsewhere in London, Ultimate Products lost 17%, despite launching a share buyback programme of up to £1 million to run until the end of July. This was because the owner of homeware brands, including Salter and Beldray, said revenue fell by 7% in the three months ended April 30, its third quarter. Ultimate Products said trading was hit by a slowdown in near-term sales from landed stocks, typically at higher gross margin, reflecting the broader slowdown seen in retail sales to consumers. It expects these trading conditions will continue throughout its fourth quarter. Brent oil was trading at $84.25 a barrel early Friday, higher than $83.62 late Thursday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will defend itself ’alone‘ if necessary, after Washington threatened to withhold further arms should Israeli troops begin a large-scale push into the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah. He said Israel would fight ’with our fingernails‘ to win, in his first public statement after the White House said it would restrict arms supplies in the case of a broader attack on Rafah. Israeli operations in Rafah are so far mainly limited to the east of city, where an evacuation order was issued at the start of the week. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his Egyptian counterpart that the US opposes forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza, after Israel seized the border crossing at Rafah. In a telephone call with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, Blinken reaffirmed President Joe Biden’s ’clear position that the US does not support a major military operation in Rafah and the US’ rejection of any forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza,‘ State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said. Blinken ’also expressed the US’ support for the reopening of Rafah crossing and the continued flow of urgently needed humanitarian assistance,‘ Miller said.

The FTSE 100 index opened down just 2.68 points at 8,351.37. The FTSE 250 was down 10.32 points, 0.1%, at 20,481.67, while the AIM All-Share was up 1.41 points, 0.2%, at 781.24. The Cboe UK 100 was marginally up at 833.97, the Cboe UK 250 was up 0.1% at 17,770.89, and the Cboe Small Companies was marginally up at 16,004.35. In European equities on Thursday, the CAC 40 in Paris was marginally up, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was up 0.2%. The BoE is expected to leave the benchmark bank rate unchanged again on Thursday, but focus will be on whether the central bank lays the groundwork for a June cut. The central bank announces its latest rate decision at 1200 BST, alongside the monetary policy report of economic projections. A press conference with Governor Andrew Bailey follows at 1230 BST. The BoE’s 25 basis points hike in August meant it has lifted rates by 5.15% during the current hiking cycle. Threadneedle Street has left rates unmoved in each of the five meetings since, however. ‘Today’s Bank of England update is expected to keep policy interest rates on hold at 5.25% for a sixth meeting in a row. However, the key issue is what signals will be given on future policy changes, including the timing of a first rate cut and the number of cuts,’ said Lloyds Bank. ‘As is the case elsewhere, financial markets have pared back their expectations for a UK rate reduction. A June reduction is now seen as having a 50% probability, and while a first cut by August is pretty much fully discounted, the number of cuts expected in total this year is around two, down from six at the start of the year. That change is partly a response to the recalibration of expectations for US interest rates but it also reflects domestic uncertainties. ‘In particular, several Monetary Policy Committee members still seem concerned about the persistence of domestic inflationary pressures, including wage growth and service prices. Nevertheless, with headline inflation set to fall close to the 2% target in April and interest rates in restrictive territory, there is scope for a signal that current market pricing on rates may be too pessimistic.’ Sterling was quoted at $1.2474 early Thursday, lower than $1.2495 at the London equities close on Wednesday. The euro traded at $1.0732 early Thursday, lower than $1.0749 late Wednesday. Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at JP¥155.82 versus JP¥155.55. In the FTSE 100, 3i lost 4.1%. The infrastructure investment trust said net asset value per share on March 31 was 2,085 pence, up from 1,745p a year earlier. Across financial 2024, it recorded a total return of 23%, down from 36% a year earlier. 3i said operating pretax profit fell to £3.83 billion from £4.58 billion, which it blamed on foreign exchange loss on investments versus gain. It declared a dividend of 34.5p per share, up from 29.75p a year earlier, taking its total financial 2024 dividend to 61p from 53p a year earlier. In the FTSE 250, Harbour Energy rose 6.0%. The oil and gas company said first quarter production averaged 172,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down from 202,000 barrels a year earlier. It proposed a final dividend of 13 US cents, up from 12 cents a year earlier, in line with its $200 million annual dividend policy and representing around 9% growth year-on-year. Harbour Energy Chief Executive Officer Linda Cook commented: ‘During the first quarter, we continued to deliver safe and responsible operations, maximise the value of our UK production base and advance our organic growth projects. At the same time, we made significant progress towards completion of the Wintershall Dea acquisition which will transform our portfolio and capital structure and support enhanced and sustainable shareholder returns.’ Elsewhere in London, Metals Exploration lost 8.6%, after the AIM-listed, Philippines-focused gold producer said two of its lenders dispute a lower interest rate of 7%, as opposed to 15%, should apply to the company’s debt facilities. It said Runruno Holdings Ltd and D&A Holdings Ltd claim several events of default have occurred under the debt facilities. Metals Explorations noted the claims would result in $2.0 million being owed to both lenders, although it disputes these allegations.

Brent oil was trading at $84.01 a barrel early Thursday, higher than $83.48 late Wednesday. President Joe Biden said he would stop US weapons supplies to Israel if it attacks Rafah in southern Gaza, his most direct warning to date over the prosecution of the war against Hamas. In an interview with CNN, Biden also deplored the fact that civilians had been killed by the dropping of US bombs on the Palestinian territory. His fresh warning came after the US last week halted a shipment of huge American bombs to Israel as it appeared ready to proceed with a major attack on Rafah – a city packed with Palestinian civilians sheltering near the Egyptian border.

Threadneedle Street maintained bank rate at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth meeting in-a-row. However, two members of its Monetary Policy Committee backed a 25 basis point cut. Seven, Governor Andrew Bailey included, supported the hold. Sterling was quoted at $1.2458 at midday on Thursday, lower than $1.2495 at the London equities close on Wednesday, and down from $1.2488 just before the BoE decision. The BoE said: ‘Headline CPI inflation has continued to fall back, in part owing to base effects and external effects from goods prices. The restrictive stance of monetary policy is weighing on activity in the real economy, is leading to a looser labour market and is bearing down on inflationary pressures. Key indicators of inflation persistence are moderating broadly as expected, although they remain elevated.’ The FTSE 100 index was up 37.96 points, 0.5% at 8,392.01. The FTSE 250 was up 37.15 points, 0.2%, at 20,529.14, and the AIM All-Share was up 2.43 points, 0.3%, at 782.26.

Pepperstone analyst Michael Brown said the BoE has taken ‘further steps towards delivering the first rate cut of the cycle’. Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden voted for a 25 basis point cut, alongside external MPC member Swati Dhingra. ‘Dissent from an internal member, however, is rather rare, and should be taken as a strong signal that the BoE are ready to cut rates, soon. Furthermore, Governor Bailey noted his ’optimism’ that things are moving in the right direction, while the latest inflation forecasts point towards the 2% CPI target being achieved in the second quarter of this year,’ Brown added. In European equities on Thursday, the CAC 40 in Paris was marginally down, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was up 0.4%, hitting a record high.

The aerospace and defence manufacturer said trading is in line with expectations, backed by increased defence spending. In a statement ahead of its annual general meeting, Chief Executive Charles Woodburn said: ‘Operational performance continues to be strong and our backlog and programme incumbencies underscore our confidence in our long-term value-creating model.’ BAE Systems said its full-year 2024 guidance remains unchanged. It expects 2024 sales growth between 10% to 12% from £25.28 billion in 2023, with underlying earnings before interest and tax to grow between 11% to 13% from £2.68 billion. Underlying earnings per share are predicted to grow between 6% to 8% from 63.2 pence in 2023. In the FTSE 250, Harbour Energy rose 6.9%. The oil and gas company said first quarter production averaged 172,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down from 202,000 barrels a year earlier.

The personal protection equipment company said it won a contract from the UK Ministry of Defence worth up to £38 million for the continued supply of general service respirator and associated in service support. The contract runs for four years with five further 12-month option periods. On AIM in London, Robinson surged 20%. The plastic and paperboard packaging manufacturer said it is in ‘advanced discussions’ over the appointment of a new chief executive officer, after a ‘thorough search process with a leading recruitment agency’. In August last year, it reported that Helene Roberts would resign as CEO in September, with senior independent non-executive director Sara Halton taking over on an interim basis while the company searched for a new CEO. Meanwhile, in a trading update, Robinson said the momentum that it experienced in the second half of 2023 has continued into 2024. Sales volumes in the first four months of 2024 are up 12% from a year earlier. With the effect of sales price and foreign exchange movements, total revenue is up 8%. Looking ahead, the company expects 2024 revenue and profit to be ahead of 2023 and current market expectations. Stocks in New York were called lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were each called down 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.2%. Brent oil was trading at $84.22 a barrel at midday on Thursday, higher than $83.48 late Wednesday. Two top Israeli officials criticised US President Joe Biden on Thursday for threatening to stop certain arms supplies to Israel if it invades the crowded Gaza city of Rafah. Israel has defied international objections by sending in tanks and conducting ‘targeted raids’ in the eastern areas of Rafah. It says Rafah is home to Hamas’s last remaining battalions but the city on the border with Egypt is also crammed with displaced Palestinian civilians. ‘If they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used... to deal with the cities,’ Biden told CNN, in his starkest warning to Israel since the start of the war. ‘Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs,’ Biden said. ‘It’s just wrong.’ Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, said Biden’s comments would be interpreted by Israel’s foes Iran, Hamas, and Hezbollah as ‘something that gives them hope to succeed’.

Shares in high-end timepiece seller Watches of Switzerland have fallen almost 60% over the past year, much of the damage done by a post-Christmas  . But the stock ticked up 1% to 328p on hopes this acquisition can help Watches of Switzerland stoke additional sales growth in the face of a wider slowdown in luxury goods demand. COINING IT IN Founded in Vicenza, Roberto Coin is an Italian luxury jewellery brand, renowned for its handcrafted fine jewellery and unique ruby signature. A partner of   for over a decade, Roberto Coin is currently the sixth largest brand in the US by sales and retail, distributing to independent and chain jewellery stores including Watches of Switzerland’s Mayors outlets across the pond and major department stores such as Saks and Bloomingdales. The acquired business, which generated sales of $138.7 million and profits of $30.2 million in 2023, has the exclusive rights to import and distribute Roberto Coin jewellery throughout the US, Canada, Caribbean and Central America. Rolex-to-TAG Heuer seller Watches of Switzerland explained that luxury branded jewellery is a core pillar of its growth strategy, pointing out that the trend within the global luxury jewellery market is towards branded jewellery, which made up 27% of the market in 2024, up from 17% in 2019. ‘In line with the group’s track record of successful previous acquisitions, we expect to deliver a smooth integration of Roberto Coin Inc into the group,’ said Watches of Switzerland. While the deal ups the group’s leverage, Watches of Switzerland insisted the acquisition will immediately enhance both margins and earnings per share. WHAT DID THE CEO SAY? CEO Brian Duffy said: ‘We have partnered with Roberto Coin for over a decade in the US, retailing its elegant jewellery in a number of our Mayors’ showrooms. It is a hugely popular, growing brand, occupying a strong position in the market, underpinned by product quality, design creativity and imagination.’ He added: ‘The luxury branded jewellery category has consistently outperformed the wider jewellery sector, and we see further strategic and operational opportunities for the business within the broader group. Today’s strategically and financially attractive acquisition is indicative of our ambition and the momentum we are building in this exciting category. It will allow us to take one of the fastest growing jewellery brands in the US and use our retail and operational expertise to accelerate growth and further elevate the Roberto Coin proposition in North and Central America.’ THE JEFFERIES VIEW Jefferies noted the deal has been done on attractive terms, with Watches of Switzerland paying less than one times trailing sales for a business with healthy margins. ‘Concerns around the wholesale nature of the target should be weighed against the retention of the Roberto Coin management talent, the channel expertise of Watches of Switzerland’s leadership team and a likely rapid cash pay-back to come,’ enthused the broker.

A ‘sore point’ for the free-to-air broadcaster came from ITV Studios which reported a 16% fall in total revenue to £382 million in the first quarter, hit by   the strike by Hollywood writers and actors and weaker demand from free-to-air broadcasters in Europe who have been holding back spend ‘until they see more certainty in the advertising market’, the firm said. The company now expects total revenues for ITV Studios   to be  over the full year 2024. STRONG PERFORMANCE Investors were treated to some good news though from ITVX, ITV’s on-demand streaming service, with total streaming hours up 16% and 14% growth in digital advertising revenues in the first quarter. The company said ITVX's   monthly active users  ‘continue to grow in line with expectations’. Media & Entertainment revenue was up 2% to £505 million compared to £495 million in the same year ago period with TAR (total advertising revenue) up 3% as previously guided. ITV said it remained on track to deliver at least £750 million of digital revenues by 2026. EXPERT VIEW Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: ‘The company’s digital strategy looks to be delivering. ITVX got a negative reception when it was first announced a little over two years ago, but the platform is attracting users and advertising at an impressive rate helping to make up for declining traditional ads. The Euros football tournament this summer will provide the usual kicker to advertising spend and ITV is looking to become a more streamlined and focused operation. For example, it is taking out costs and sold its  Britbox  International joint venture earlier this year. ‘It’s a long road back for ITV to the share price highs achieved in the mid-2010s, after a previous turnaround under Adam Crozier, but there is evidence of genuine progress’, added Mould.

In a market update, the business information publisher and events organiser said all business were delivering ahead of or in line with annual targets. Informa expects 2024 revenue will be at the upper end of its £3.45 billion to £3.50 billion guidance range, while adjusted operating profit is expected to be at the upper end of £950 million to £970 million guidance range. Among London’s mid-caps, John Wood Group jumped 17%. The consulting and engineering firm for energy and materials sectors rejected a fresh takeover attempt. John Wood said it had received an ‘unsolicited, preliminary and conditional’ proposal from Dar Al-Handasah Consultants Shair and Partners Holdings Ltd, Sidara, regarding a possible cash offer. Sidara is a family-owned engineering company, founded in Beirut, with more than 300 offices in 60 countries. The proposal, received last Tuesday, valued each John Wood share at 205p each, around £1.41 billion in total. John Wood concluded that it ‘fundamentally undervalued Wood and its future prospects,’ and rejected the proposal unanimously on Wednesday. Renishaw gave back 4.2%. It said revenue in the third quarter improved upon the first two quarters of its financial year, but nine-month revenue and profit were both down on a year before. The provider of manufacturing technologies, analytical instruments and medical devices lowered its full-year guidance in response. Renishaw said it expects full-year revenue in the range of £680 million to £700 million, narrowed and mostly lower compared to previous guidance of £675 million to £715 million. It expects adjusted pretax profit in the range of £122 million to £135 million, down from previous guidance of £122 million to £147 million. Among London’s small caps, STV rose 2.0%, after the broadcast television channel operator and content studio said BBC Daytime has commissioned new series of antiques programmes ’Antiques Road Trip’, ’Celebrity Antiques Road Trip’ and ’The Travelling Auctioneers’ from production company STV Studios, in an order totalling 56 episodes. STV said production has already begun on a third 20-episode series of The Travelling Auctioneers. Brent oil was trading at $83.48 a barrel late Wednesday afternoon, largely unmoved from $83.51 late Tuesday. Gold was quoted at $2,317.69 an ounce, lower than $2,322.59.

A fall in the domestic currency is typically helpful to the FTSE 100 because it boosts the relative value of its dominant overseas earnings,’ said AJ Bell analyst Russ Mould. ‘Currency traders are betting against the pound ahead of the Bank of England’s latest meeting tomorrow, amid a growing expectation it will cut rates earlier than counterparts at the US Federal Reserve. It’s extremely unlikely there will be any action tomorrow but the market will be watching the surrounding commentary for any clues on when the Bank of England might take the plunge on rates.’ Sterling was quoted at $1.2490 before midday on Wednesday, lower than $1.2542 at the London equities close on Tuesday.

In the FTSE 250, Wetherspoon rose 3.6%, after the pub chain said like-for-like sales rose 5.2% in the 13 weeks to April 28 from a year earlier, while year-to-date like-for-like sales rose by 8.3%. Total sales increased by 3.3% in the quarter and by 6.5% in the year-to-date, it added. Looking ahead, JD Wetherspoon said it expects profits in the current financial year to be ‘towards the top of market expectations’.

OSB rose 3.2%, after the mortgage lender said financial and operational performance in the first quarter of 2024 was stable, with underlying net interest margin on track to meet full year guidance. It reported first quarter new originations of £1.0 billion, down from £1.2 billion a year earlier, while underlying and statutory net loans and advances on March 31 rose to £26.0 billion from £25.7 billion on December 31. OSB Chief Executive Officer Andy Golding commented: ‘The group is well positioned to deliver attractive and sustainable returns across the cycle, with a strong and resilient business model, robust capital and liquidity position, secured loan book and proven risk management capabilities.

STV said production has already begun on a third 20-episode series of The Travelling Auctioneers. On AIM in London, Mobile Tornado more than doubled to 2.50p. The critical communications services provider said it won a deal via its regional partner to supply a range of ‘cutting-edge’ technologies for an unnamed ‘prominent’ mobile network operator in the Middle East and Africa. No financial details were disclosed. Key features of the solutions being provided by Mobile Tornado include voice and video calls to ‘anywhere in the world at the push of a button’; lone worker support including real-time location tracking, emergency SOS alerts, device inactivity monitoring and ambient listening; alongside ‘significantly lower’ data usage than comparative solutions of around 300 megabytes per month. Mobile Tornado Executive Chair Jeremy Fenn commented: ‘We identified the Middle East as a crucial region for business development, and this new contract through our local partner provides us with a platform for expansion across multiple territories...This contract, in a key target market, is a testament to the changes we made early last year and the board looks forward to increasing sales momentum as 2024 develops.’ Stocks in New York were called flat.

Crashing recession avoided, interest rate cuts coming - it might not be quite the Goldilocks outcome hoped for but good enough. Thursday’s S&P 500 move higher left the crucial US index to close above the 5,200 level for the first time in a month and back within 1% of its record following a rough April. ‘The next policy move is a cut, and even if that cut is still months away, we are already past the peak tightening impulse’, said analysts at TS Lombard. A report showing a pick-up in layoffs helped to support the market. The number of workers applying for unemployment benefits rose last week by more than economists expected, though it remains relatively low compared with history. That could be a sign the economy can pull off a hoped-for balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession, but not so strong that it puts upward pressure on inflation. Treasury yields erased earlier gains immediately after the report’s release, an indication of expectations for the Federal Reserve to deliver long-sought cuts to interest rates later this year. Elsewhere on Wall Street, some stocks swung sharply following their latest earnings reports. Data centres operator  Equinix (EQIX:NASDAQ)  jumped after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The news was less positive for IT services supplier  EPAM Systems (EPAM:NYSE) , which spiralled 27% lower after management suggested a ‘soft’ demand environment that was improving more slowly than hoped. Well-known names like travel firm  Expedia (EXPE:NASDAQ) , cybersecurity play  Fortinet (FTNT:NASDAQ) ,  Airbnb (ABNB:NSASDAQ)  and  Disney (DIS:NYSE)  were weak also. WALT DISNEY News that the ‘House of Mouse’ has made its streaming service profitable ahead of schedule should have sprinkled some stardust on Disney’s stock this week, but soft guidance alongside the second quarter results (7 May) sent shares in the entertainment giant 7.5% lower to $105.3. Disney beat earnings estimates for the quarter to 30 March 2024 as Disney+ and Hulu turned a profit for the first time, but revenue was shy of forecasts for the fourth quarter on the spin. Disney also guided for a decline in third quarter subscriptions which it hopes to reverse by copying the  Netflix (NFLX:NASDAQ)  playbook of preventing password sharing. Also weighing on sentiment was the performance of Disney’s money-spinning parks business, where growth is slowing as the post-pandemic travel boom fades. CEO Bob Iger said that looking at Disney as a whole, ‘it’s clear that the turnaround and growth initiatives we set in motion last year have continued to yield positive results’. Iger added that Disney is ‘turbocharging growth in our experiences business with a number of near- and long-term strategic investments.’ ARM HOLDINGS Lacklustre guidance in the face of an AI demand boom left the British chip tech designer hung out to dry. But the grand sell-off predicted by pre-market data didn’t materialise as investors chewed over pointers a touch on the soft side. What looks like a relative dose of conservatism on  Arm’s (ARM:NASDAQ)  part may pay off over time if it helps reinforce the company’s credibility and earns it a reputation for under-promising and over-delivering, as it largely had when listed in London years ago. Vast amounts of computing power are required to underpin the AI revolution and if Arm can continue to demonstrate it is at the forefront of this effort – such as the launch of its latest V9 chip architecture - then any disappointment over its latest cautious outlook could prove short-lived. ROBLOX Shares in video game platform  Roblox (RBLX:NASDAQ)  plunged more than 25% in early trading on Thursday (9 May) after the firm cut its annual bookings forecast amid lower engagement from its users. The cut is the latest in a string of disappointing updates from gaming companies as demand normalises from the huge spike seen during the pandemic. Earlier in the week (7 may) video game developer  Electronic Arts (EA:NASDAQ)  missed sales and profit estimates. Roblox lowered expectations for full year bookings to $4.05 billion at the midpoint of the range from a prior forecast of $4.21 billion while second quarter booking are now anticipated to be between $879 million and $900 million compared with a consensus estimate of $929 million. The company grew average daily users by 17% year over year in the first quarter, in line with Street estimates, but the number of hours spent on the platform came in at 16.7 billion hours, falling short of the 17.1 billion forecasted. CEO David Baszucki said: ‘Our teams have been hard at work identifying opportunities to drive daily active users, hours, and bookings growth rates back to 20% year over year.’   You can opt out at any time."},

However, with the stock price having risen more than 50% over the past 12 months there was an element of profit-taking and the shares eased 101p or 3.4% to £28.73 in morning trade. ACTION STATIONS For the year to March 2024, 3i generated a total return of £3.84 billion or 23% on shareholders’ opening funds, which came on the back of a 36% increase the previous year. NAV per share increased to £20.85 despite a 33p headwind from foreign currencies, which provided a 65p per share tailwind a year earlier. The private equity business delivered a gross investment return of £4.06 billion or 25% driven mainly by the ‘very strong’ performance of Dutch value retailer Action which makes up the bulk of the group’s portfolio in value terms. Action generated a gross investment return of £3.72 billion or 33% thanks to annual revenue growth of 28% and a 34% increase in EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation). This gain, together with strong growth in the value-for-money, private-label and healthcare sectors, more than offset temporary weakness in some of the group’s holdings in discretionary consumer spending businesses. The infrastructure business only generated a gross return on investment of £99 million or 7% due to modest price gains for 3i Infrastructure  ( )  which lagged the underlying portfolio and NAV return, although the US infrastructure portfolio performed well for another year. During the year, the group received £1.4 billion of cash and the private equity team invested £556 million, principally in a further stake in Action, while some of its portfolio companies made bolt-on acquisitions using their own balance sheets. YEARS IN THE MAKING ‘The shape of today’s portfolio has served us well in this challenging year and reflects investment decisions taken over the last 12 years’,   chief executive Simon Borrows. ‘We expect that the current macro-economic conditions and geopolitical uncertainty will persist in the near term and that this will continue to impact confidence and pricing expectations in the wider mid-cap M&A market. ‘Our rigorous and disciplined approach to capital allocation remains unchanged.

Good news was tempered by a weak outlook as the San Francisco-based company projected second quarter revenue of between $268 billion and $274 billion, short of the $2.74 billion Wall Street analysts were calling for. Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) is expected to be flat at $819 million compared with forecasts of $917 million. The shares are up around 24% over the last 12-months compared with a 34% gain in the Nasdaq Composite index. HOW DID THE COMPANY PERFORM? Revenue in the three months to the end of March increased 18% year-on-year to $2.1 billion, slightly ahead of forecasts and driven by solid growth in nights and experiences booked and a ‘modest’ increase in the average daily rate. The earlier timing of Easter and an extra leap-year trading day in February contributed to the strong start to the year. Free cash flow increased 19% to $1.9 billion taking the trailing twelve-month free cash flow to $4.2 billion equating to a margin on sales of 41%. Strong cash generation allowed the company to repurchase $750 million shares. Airbnb has an authorisation to purchase a further $6 billion of shares equating to around 6% of its current market capitalisation. Management said it expected growth to pick up in the middle of the year ahead of a busy summer of events including the Olympic Games in Paris, France. EXPERT VIEW Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, commented: ‘Easter happening in March rather than April has effectively pulled forward seasonal demand into the first quarter, while foreign exchange issues also cast a dark cloud. ‘The Easter issue not only removes a traditional second quarter sales catalyst but also hits margins in the period because Airbnb won’t benefit from the traditional boost in prices that normally happens in early April. Throw in some one-off payment processing issues and higher marketing expenses and it’s clear that Airbnb’s head is spinning. ‘Strategically, the business looks focused on the right things. It is trying to make the concept of hosting more mainstream, improving the service for hosts and guests, and investing in less mature markets. It is also exploring the world of experiences where guests can stay in places like the last remaining Blockbuster shop, Ted Lasso’s favourite pub and Prince’s Purple Rain house.’ Disclaimer: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in the article owns Shares magazine.

For example, South Korea’s  SK Hynix (000660:KRX)  recently revealed that it had nearly sold out its entire manufacturing capacity through to the end of 2025, such is the demand from chip designers, not just for AI chips, but from industries like automotive, defence and medical. US firm  GlobalFoundries (GFS:NASDAQ)  is starting to make similarly supportive noises. ‘As pockets of the semiconductor industry begin to emerge from the inventory correction, our teams are driving foundry innovation and differentiation for our customers across their essential end-markets’, said GlobalFoundries chief executive Thomas Caulfield as the company he runs soundly beat first quarter forecasts on both the top and bottom lines, sparking a share price surge to $53.49, based on pre-market data.   DOWN BUT BOUNCING Sharply down year-on-year they were, yet Q1 EPS (earnings per share) of $0.31 beat the $0.23 analyst consensus by a third on $1.55 billion of revenue, again beating analyst projections pitched at $1.52 billion. Year-on-year declines were 40% and 16% respectively. Yet as the market turns to look beyond the current 12 months, there is increasingly hope that GlobalFoundries could be putting up record breaking numbers. Data firm Stockopedia has 2025 (to 31 Dec) consensus at $2.09 EPS on $7.78 billion of revenue, which would both be all time highs. GlobalFoundires sees Q2 EPS in a range of $0.24 to $0.34 on $1.59 billion to $1.64 billion revenue. That’s versus the $0.28 and $1.59 billion consensus estimate. $1.5 BILLION IN US GRANTS Underlining that optimism is significant financial backing from the US Government, among the first dished out under the Biden administration’s Chips Act. GlobalFoundires bagged $1.5 billion to support the expansion of its production facility in Malta, New York and expand capacity at its Vermont plant. The company anticipates investing more than $12 billion over the next decade to keep pace with demand for chips from the automotive, aerospace, defence and AI industries. GlobalFoundries generated $488 million in operating cash flow in Q1, with $4.2 billion now sat on the balance sheet. You can opt out at any time."},

The Manchester-based clothing and beauty purveyor also reported a 7% drop in adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) to £58.6 million. That was towards the bottom end of the £58 million to £70 million guidance range and below the previous year’s £63.3 million figure, sending the shares 3.7% lower to 34p on Wednesday. However, green shoots are appearing at indebted Boohoo with the performance of core brands including the eponymous label, PrettyLittleThing and Debenhams picking up in the second half. Margins are also improving thanks to Boohoo’s focus on more profitable sales and the benefits of ongoing cost-saving programmes. UNDER PRESSURE Group revenue fell 17% to £1.5 billion last year amid persistently challenging market conditions including fierce competition from Shein and the post-pandemic normalisation of online shopping, not to mention management’s focus on more profitable sales. UK revenue declined 16% to £921.5 million, while US revenues were down 18%. Management noted an improvement in sales momentum between the first and second halves, and having opened its new US distribution centre and completed its automation project in Sheffield   believes it is well-positioned having invested for sustainable and profitable growth. With greater cost savings and lower capex having completed these two projects, management is confident of achieving its medium-term EBITDA margin target of 6%-8% and expects the business to be free cash flow positive in the current financial year. WHAT DID THE CEO SAY? Chief executive John Lyttle said: ‘Despite difficult market conditions caused by high levels of inflation and weakened consumer demand, we made continued progress in the year. I am particularly encouraged with the ongoing trend of improved performance in our core brands which saw GMV (gross merchandise value) down 9% in H124 and down just 4% in H224 demonstrating increasing momentum and validating our strategy to focus on these brands which are much loved by our customer base.’ AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould pointed out Boohoo’s balance sheet is showing some signs of strain amid restructuring costs, so cash generation is key. ‘Capital expenditure is coming down as the company completes on its Sheffield automation centre and US distribution hub which should help, and Boohoo has reaffirmed its medium-term margin target,’ said Mould. ‘The company’s progress is somewhat hidden behind some weak headline numbers and this work will mean little if demand does not improve. The disposable nature of some of its products is at odds with a commitment to green issues, which appears to be particularly important to its core demographic of teenagers and young adults.’ Mould added: ‘The UK competition authorities are watching the business closely after a recent investigation into ‘greenwashing’ so Boohoo can’t afford to massage the truth about its supply chain and environmental impact.’ DISCLAIMER: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in this article owns Shares magazine.

Pre-market data has the stock down more than 3% to around $91 after the company issued fiscal first quarter 2025 guidance below analyst estimates. The Arizona-based business sees Q1 2025 EPS (earnings per share) in a range between $0.48 and $0.56, falling short of consensus estimates of $0.57, and sales guidance was even weaker, projecting revenue for the quarter to be between $1.22 billion and $1.26 billion, versus the forecasted $1.34 billion. Not an obvious play on AI (artificial intelligence), which has done wonders for shares in companies like  Nvidia (NVDA:NASDAQ)  and  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD:NASDAQ) , Microchip sits alongside the likes of  Texas Instruments (TXN:NASDAQ)  and  Micron Technology (MU:NASDAQ)  in producing those really crucial, but lower margin, picks and shovels chips that power modern electronics and appliances. DIVIDEND JUMPS 18% That focus has typically made Microchip Technology a powerful cash machine that pays dividends at much higher rates than most technology stocks. The forecast yield this year, for example, stands at 2.2%, versus 0.56% for  Apple (AAPL:NASDAQ) . This means that despite experiencing what the company called a ‘major inventory correction’ in recent months, the fiscal 2024 (to 31 Mar) dividend was raised 18% to $0.452 per share. ‘We remained committed to our capital return program, returning $1.89 billion through dividends and share buybacks during fiscal 2024, up 15.4% from the prior year, and we are tracking towards achieving our goal of returning 100% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders by the current fiscal year-end’, the company said. ‘We experienced a major inventory correction in fiscal 2024, leading to a 9.5% decline in revenue to $7.6 billion.

Growth in the UK construction sector quickened in April, according to the latest purchasing managers’ index survey results from S&P Global. The headline S&P Global UK construction PMI in April rose to 53.0 in points in April from 50.2 in March. The reading indicates an expansion of growth, rising further above the 50.0 no-change mark. FXStreet-cited consensus had been expecting a reading of 50.4. It also marked expansion for the second month in a row, S&P Global said. Pantheon Macroeconomics analyst Rob Wood commented on the data: ‘Housebuilding took a breather in April but civil engineering and commercial activity surged as economic conditions continued to improve. Remarkably the construction PMI has recovered to only one point below its 1998-to-2019 average, having been nine points below last September, and is consistent with official construction output rising 0.6% three-months-on-three-months.’ Annual growth in UK house prices quickened last month, while they returned to slight growth on a monthly basis, numbers from mortgage lender Halifax showed Tuesday. UK house price growth quickened to 1.1% year-on-year in April, Halifax said, from a 0.4% rise in March. Prices ticked up 0.1% in April from March, having fallen 0.9% in March from February. The monthly rise in April was expected to be 0.2%, according to FXStreet-cited consensus. The average UK house price in April was £288,949, up from £288,781 in March. ‘Housebuilders were among the stocks in demand after British house prices returned to growth, albeit only by a fraction. Halifax data gave hope that the property market was getting up on its feet after a soggy patch, enticing investors to look at names such as Persimmon and Barratt,’ said AJ Bell analyst Russ Mould. Persimmon and Barratt both rose 2.6% and 1.7% respectively. Elsewhere in the FTSE 100, BP ticked down 0.1%. The oil major said replacement cost profit was down to $1.61 billion from $8.67 billion a year earlier, but up from $1.53 billion from the fourth quarter. Total first quarter revenue was down to $48.88 billion from $56.18 billion a year earlier, and down from $52.14 billion in the fourth quarter, while first quarter upstream production was 2.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 2.1% from a year earlier. BP has started a new $1.75 billion share buyback programme for the first quarter as planned, while it says a total of $3.5 billion is still planned in share buybacks for the first half of 2024. It declared a quarterly dividend of 7.27 cents per share, unchanged from the fourth quarter and up from 6.61 cents a year earlier. Looking ahead, it expects upstream production to be slightly lower in the second quarter from the first quarter, while across 2024, it expects upstream production to be slightly up from 2023 on both a reported and underlying basis. ‘BP’s first-quarter profits are down year-on-year and lower than expected thanks in the main to lower gas prices and temporary problems at a refinery in Indiana, US, although shareholders are unlikely to be too concerned given the company’s ability to return $3 billion to them via dividends and buybacks in just three months,’ said AJ Bell’s Mould. ‘BP is on course to return the same amount in the next three months of 2024 and if it maintains that pace for the whole year then the oil and gas major will return more than 11% of its stock market valuation to investors, a cash yield that easily exceeds Bank of England base rates, government gilt yields and inflation.’ In the FTSE 250, SDCL Energy Efficiency rose 3.7%, after it agreed to sell UU Solar to UK Power for £90.8 million. The investor in assets in the energy efficiency sector said the agreed price represents a 4.5% premium to UU Solar’s September 30 valuation. SDCL Energy Efficiency said the sale proceeds will be used to reduce short term borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Among London’s small-caps, Robert Walters rose 4.6% to 385 pence, after Deutsche Bank starts its coverage of the recruitment consultancy firm with a ’buy’ rating, setting a target price of 600p per share. Mears Group also rose 5.0% to 386.5p, after Deutsche Bank also starts its coverage of the housing maintenance and social housing provider with a ’buy’ rating, setting a target price of 425p per share. On AIM in London, Totally rose 19%. In a trading update for the financial year that ended March 31, the healthcare services provider said it expects revenue to fall to £106 million from £135.7 million a year earlier, but with earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to double to around £2.3 million from £1.1 million. Totally said the improved bottom-line was against a tough operational backdrop and follows a review by the board of its ‘structures, systems and processes to ensure it remains focused on growth and the provision of support to its commissioners when required’. Stocks in New York were called mixed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was called up 0.2%, the S&P 500 index marginally up, while the Nasdaq Composite was called down 0.2%. Brent oil was trading at $83.07 a barrel on Tuesday midday, higher than $82.91 late Friday. Israel carried out strikes on the Gazan city of Rafah overnight as it sought to put ‘pressure’ on Hamas ahead of talks in Egypt on Tuesday aimed at sealing a truce proposal endorsed by the militants. After having vowed for weeks to push into the southern border town, Israel called on Monday for Palestinians in eastern Rafah to leave for an ‘expanded humanitarian area’ ahead of a ground incursion. After talks earlier in the day failed to produce an agreement, Hamas said Monday evening that it had informed mediators Egypt and Qatar of its ‘approval of their proposal regarding a ceasefire’ in the seven-month-old war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the proposal ‘is far from Israel’s essential demands’, but the government would send negotiators for talks ‘to exhaust the potential for arriving at an agreement’.

The euro traded at $1.0743 early Wednesday, lower than $1.0774 late Tuesday. Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at JP¥155.29 versus JP¥154.49. In the FTSE 100, Informa led the pack, rising 2.5%, after it increased its share buyback programme for 2024 by 50% to £500 million. In a market update, the business information publisher and events organiser said all business were delivering ahead of or in line with annual targets. Informa expects 2024 revenue will be at the the upper end of its £3.45 billion to £3.50 billion guidance range, while adjusted operating profit is expected to be at the upper end of £950 million to £970 million guidance range. Centrica rose 2.1% to 133.94 pence, after UBS raised its rating for the owner of British Gas to ’buy’ from ’neutral’, setting an increased price target of 170p from 165p. In the FTSE 250, OSB led gains, rising 5.5%. The mortgage lender said financial and operational performance in the first quarter of 2024 was stable, with underlying net interest margin on track to meet full year guidance. It reported first quarter new originations of £1.0 billion, down from £1.2 billion a year earlier, while underlying and statutory net loans and advances on March 31 rose to £26.0 billion from £25.7 billion on December 31. OSB Chief Executive Officer Andy Golding commented: ‘The group is well positioned to deliver attractive and sustainable returns across the cycle, with a strong and resilient business model, robust capital and liquidity position, secured loan book and proven risk management capabilities. I look to the future with confidence.’ JD Wetherspoon rose 3.2%, after the pub chain said like-for-like sales rose 5.2% in the 13 weeks to April 28 from a year earlier, while year-to-date like-for-like sales rose by 8.3%. Total sales increased by 3.3% in the quarter and by 6.5% in the year-to-date, it added. Looking ahead, JD Wetherspoon said it expects profits in the current financial year to be ‘towards the top of market expectations’. Among London’s small caps, Ocean Wilsons rose 5.6%. In the first quarter of 2024, the investment holding company said revenue rose to £129.4 million from £109.8 million a year earlier, while profit increased to $21.2 million from $16.4 million. Across the first quarter, Ocean Wilsons said its portfolio increased in value by $12.7 million or 4.1%, driven by the ‘strong performance of the public asset portfolio and the fact that the defensive portfolio performed well versus government bonds’. On AIM in London, boohoo lost 4.1%. The fast fashion firm said pretax loss in the financial year ended February 29 widened to £159.9 million from £90.7 million a year earlier, hurt by a 17% fall in revenue to £1.46 billion from £1.77 billion. boohoo said the decline in revenue was due to a focus on profitability and difficult market conditions. Looking ahead, boohoo said it is targeting gross merchandise value growth in the year ahead and continued improvement in adjusted Ebitda margin. It said it was confident of a 6% to 8% Ebitda margin target in the medium term, while it also said it is on track for £125 million in annualised cost savings for its financial 2025. Brent oil was trading at $82.18 a barrel early Wednesday, lower than $83.51 late Tuesday. Israel said it reopened the Kerem Shalom border crossing to humanitarian aid for Gaza on Wednesday, four days after closing it in response to a rocket attack that killed four soldiers. ‘Trucks from Egypt carrying humanitarian aid, including food, water, shelter equipment, medicine and medical equipment donated by the international community are already arriving at the crossing,’ the army said in a joint statement with COGAT, the defence ministry body that oversees Palestinian civil affairs. The supplies will be transferred to the Gaza side of the crossing after undergoing inspection, it added. The statement said the Erez border crossing between Israel and northern Gaza is also open for aid deliveries into the Palestinian territory. The Kerem Shalom crossing was closed after a Hamas rocket attack killed four soldiers and wounded more than a dozen on Sunday. On Tuesday, Israeli troops seized control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt after launching an incursion into the eastern sector of the city. The United Nations and Israel’s staunchest ally the US both condemned the closure of the two crossings which are a lifeline for civilians facing looming famine. The US halted a shipment of bombs to Israel last week after it failed to address Washington’s concerns over plans to invade the southern Gaza city of Rafah, a senior US official said Tuesday. Biden’s administration made the decision when it appeared Israel was on the verge of a major ground operation into Rafah, which Washington has strongly opposed. Israeli and US officials had been discussing alternatives but ‘those discussions are ongoing and have not fully addressed our concerns,’ the senior US official said.

However, the FTSE 100 energy titan’s shareholder-friendly focus helped limit the price damage. BP maintained its share buyback at $1.75 billion for the quarter and recommitted to buybacks of $3.5 billion for the first half of 2024 as new boss Murray Auchincloss seeks to narrow the valuation gap with  Shell  ( )  and US peers. INAUSPICIOUS START BP’s drop in first-quarter profits reflected a ‘significantly weaker’ fuel margin and lower oil and gas prices. Underlying replacement cost profit came in at $2.7 billion, below the $2.9 billion called for by analysts and down from the near-$3 billion   generated in the previous quarter. Energy industry profitability generally has been impacted by a drop in gas prices, although BP’s quarterly miss still represents a relatively inauspicious start for Auchincloss since his interim role was made permanent in January. This followed the   of predecessor Bernard Looney due to undisclosed personal relationships with colleagues prior to becoming chief executive. WHAT DID AUCHINCLOSS SAY? Auchincloss insisted his charge delivered ‘another resilient quarter financially and continued to make progress on our strategy. Oil production was up and our ACE platform in the Caspian is now producing.’ He added: ‘We are simplifying and reducing complexity across BP and plan to deliver at least $2 billion of cash cost savings by the end of 2026 through high grading our portfolio, digital transformation, supply chain efficiencies and global capability hubs.’ In terms of BP’s energy transition strategy, Auchincloss appears to be singing off the same hymn sheet as Wael Sawan, his counterpart at Shell. Essentially, BP will make green investments as long as they pay. Jamie Maddock, energy analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said ultimately, ‘the market is going to compare BP to Shell a lot at the moment, particularly as the latter is doing well in fairly volatile conditions. For BP however, this means slight misses in results leads to a slightly more over-exaggerated reaction. Today’s results from BP were fairly uneventful in the grand scheme of things with its earnings and shareholder returns more or less as expected.’ Maddock added: ‘Despite profits being lower than the market expected, BP has maintained its share buyback at $1.75 billion for the quarter. This is positive and suggests it has confidence in its earnings going forward, despite the ups and downs of the commodity markets. Furthermore, the business is looking to make at least $2 billion in cost savings by the end of 2026 as it looks to grapple with lower oil and gas prices compared with the past couple of years.’ VALUATION DISPARITY Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, observed that Auchincloss’ use of the word ‘pragmatic’ will be seen as a euphemism in some quarters for putting profit before the planet. ‘However, to an even greater extent than Shell’s Sawan, Auchincloss is eyeing a big valuation disparity between his charge and rivals across the Atlantic and will clearly feel a big part of his remit is closing that gap,’ said Mould. ‘To that end, the company is targeting efficiencies and savings through initiatives like the use of technology and improvements to its supply chain. Maintaining the pace on share buybacks demonstrates a commitment to returning cash to shareholders.’ DISCLAIMER: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in this article owns Shares magazine.

The shares, which touched 240p two months ago after Belgian insurer Ageas  (AGS:EBR)  made a preliminary offer, drifted 5p or 2.5% lower to 184p. PREMIUMS UP BUT CLAIMS ALSO UP The Bromley-based company’s first-quarter update was generally positive, with double-digit increases in gross written premiums in motor, home and commercial insurance and overall growth of 15% in income from ongoing operations to £707 million. Direct own-brand motor premiums were up 13% to £400 million while own-brand home premiums were up 17% to £110 million and commercial own brands were 15% better at £72 million. Motor claims trends were in line with the company’s expectations, meaning margins were kept above 10%, but home claims were higher at £33 million due to adverse weather during the quarter, with £24 million of directly event-related claims against the firm’s full-year assumption of £54 million. FOCUS ON LOWERING COSTS As well as highlighting the firm’s positive current trading, Winslow drew attention to Direct Line’s recent push to hire in senior industry figures in an effort to reduce costs. Later this year Craig Thornton, formerly head of general insurance at  Lloyds Banking Group  ( ) , will join as managing director of the home and growth division, while Hugh Hessing joins as chief operating from  Aviva  ( )  where he held the same role and Martin Milliner joins as director of claims having previously been in the same role at German insurance giant  Allianz (ALV:ETR) . ‘I am confident that with the new leadership team in place, we can deliver run-rate annualised cost savings of at least £100 million by the end of 2025 and a net insurance margin, normalised for weather, of 13% in 2026’,   the chief executive. ‘I look forward to sharing our refreshed strategy to deliver higher returns and the progress we have made against the immediate priorities to improve performance at our Capital Markets Day on 10th July 2024’, added Winslow.

SMALLER-THAN-EXPECTED LOSS The Cambridge-based firm said in April trading had been in line with its expectations since mid-January with the biggest contributions coming from  Jurassic World Evolution 2  and  Planet Zoo . The fantasy games-maker also revealed last month it had sold the publishing rights to  RollerCoaster Tycoon 3  to industry peer Atari for $7 million in cash with an up-front payment of $4 million and the balance deferred. This morning’s update on trading for the full financial year to the end of May said the firm’s portfolio has performed well with ‘pleasing contributions from all games’. The company made a big marketing push on leading PC channel Steam in the first half of April, while on consoles  Planet Zoo  continued to sell well last month following its successful release in March.

ANALYST VIEWS Shore Capital analyst Katie Cousins, who raised her recommendation to Buy last month, said the latest sales and earnings guidance was above forecasts and the group’s focus on core titles together with cost savings ‘now indicates a much better exit run rate than originally expected’ with break-even EBITDA possible in the coming financial year.

The FTSE 100 index closed up 41.34 points, 0.5%, at 8,213.49. The FTSE 250 ended up 112.21 points, 0.6%, at 20,164.54, and the AIM All-Share closed up 3.42 points, 0.5%, at 771.53. Over the course of the week, they were up 0.9%, 1.7%, and 2.0%, respectively. The Cboe UK 100 ended up 0.5% at 819.94, the Cboe UK 250 closed up 0.8% at 17,485.45, and the Cboe Small Companies ended up slightly at 15,785.78. In European equities on Friday, the CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX 40 in Frankfurt ended up 0.5%. Stocks in New York were higher at the London equities close, with the DJIA and the S&P 500 index were both up 0.9%, and the Nasdaq Composite up 1.7%. The FTSE 100 and stocks in New York got a boost on Friday, as investors sighed a breath of relief amid hopes for earlier than expected interest rate cuts in the US. Data on Friday depicted a softer than expected labour market in the US. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nonfarm payroll employment rose by 175,000 in April. This was below a FXStreet consensus of 243,000 and lower than the average monthly gain of 242,000 over the prior 12 months. The February total was revised down by 34,000, to 236,000 from 270,000, while the total for March was revised up by 12,000, to 315,000 from 303,000. With these revisions, employment in February and March combined was 22,000 lower than previously reported. In April, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 0.2% to $34.75. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 3.9%. The unemployment rate in April was 3.9%, rising from 3.8% in March. ‘Job creation was weaker, unemployment higher and wage growth more subdued than expected in the April employment report. With Fed Chair Powell leaning dovish at Wednesday’s press conference this has breathed new life into Federal Reserve interest rate cut calls,’ said James Knightley at ING. Knightley added that he is sticking to his September Federal Reserve interest rate cut call. Interest rates were left unchanged on Wednesday by the US Federal Reserve, on a ‘lack of progress’ towards its inflation target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell downplayed fears that the next move on interest rates could be upwards, suggesting policy will prove restrictive enough to lower inflation. However, he also dashed hopes for a near-term rate cut noting it was taking longer to gain confidence that inflation was on track to hit the central bank’s 2% target. The pound was quoted at $1.2549 at the London equities close Friday, up compared to $1.2487 at the close on Thursday. The euro stood at $1.0769 at the European equities close Friday, higher against $1.0690 at the same time on Thursday. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥152.89, lower compared to JP¥154.05 late Thursday. In the FTSE 100 index, the biggest loser was InterContinental Hotels Group, down 2.5%. The Berkshire, England-based hotel operator said first quarter revenue per available room rose 2.6% on-year. It noted an 8.9% rise in the Europe, the Middle East, Asia & Africa region, and a 2.5% rise in Greater China. In the Americas, revPAR fell 0.3%. ‘The Americas, having already recovered very strongly, was broadly flat due to some adverse calendar timing,’ IHG said. In the FTSE 250, Trainline jumped 6.6%. The rail ticketing platform painted an optimistic picture, though possible rail sector upheaval in the UK hangs over it. Revenue in the year ended February 29 rose 21% to £396.7 million, from £327.1 million. Revenue topped the ‘previous guidance range’. Pretax profit jumped to £48.1 million from £22.1 million. Trainline announced a £75.0 million share buyback programme. It recently completed a £50.0 million buyback which kicked off in September. On AIM, Fletcher King shot up 27%. The chartered surveyors firm reported a ‘strong second half business performance’, a turnaround from the more ‘cautionary business outlook’ it gave back in December. Revenue for the year ended April 30 ‘is now expected to be materially higher than management expectations’. Pretax profit is expected to be between two and three times higher than the £192,000 it reported for the prior year.

Financial markets in London were closed on Monday for the May Day bank holiday. Missing out on the confident trade were budget carriers, as the likes of easyJet and Wizz Air fell after a summer pricing warning from peer Ryanair. The FTSE 100 index closed up 100.18 points, 1.2%, at 8,313.67. The FTSE 250 ended up 248.54 points, 1.2%, at 20,413.08, and the AIM All-Share closed up 4.89 points, 0.6%, at 776.42.

In European equities on Tuesday, the CAC 40 in Paris added 1.0% and the DAX 40 in Frankfurt jumped 1.4%. ‘The FTSE 100 may feel friendless, given the ongoing concerns about firms delisting from the UK to join other exchanges, the lack of new flotations and cries for fresh initiatives to boost interest. But the UK equity market’s premier index is setting new all-time highs all the same, perhaps to adage that, ’you can have good news and cheap stocks, just not both at the same time’,’ AJ Bell analyst Russ Mould commented. ‘Investors now have to decide whether the UK is cheap because it deserves to be cheap, or whether the times really are changing, because if they are then further welcome gains could be on the cards.’ Supporting the FTSE 100 on Tuesday, was the interest rate-sensitive housebuilding sector. Persimmon rose 3.5%, while Barratt Developments added 3.0%. Friday’s US data took some sting out of US rate expectations, with a similar ‘knock-on’ to UK rate forecasts. Analysts at Lloyds Bank commented: ‘Global markets have continued to react with some relief after Federal Reserve Chair Powell last week doused fears that the US policy interest rates may have further to rise. He acknowledged recent upside data surprises, including inflation, but indicated that the Fed in response would delay the start of rate cuts and keep them at current restrictive levels for a while longer. That sentiment continued last Friday with the latest jobs data showing signs that the US labour market slowed at the start of Q2. ‘Unsurprisingly, shifting expectations around the US interest rate outlook have also had a knock-on effect to UK interest rate expectations.’ The pace of hiring in the US slowed more than expected in April, and the unemployment rate rose, figures on Friday had showed. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, non-farm payroll employment rose by 175,000 in April. This was below a FXStreet consensus of 243,000 and lower than the average monthly gain of 242,000 over the prior 12 months. The February total was revised down by 34,000, to 236,000 from 270,000. The Bank of England’s announces its latest interest rate decision on Thursday. A press conference with Governor Andrew Bailey follows. ING analyst Chris Turner commented: ‘Were it not for the comments of Bank of England Chief Economist, Huw Pill, markets would be a lot more excited about a doveish shift in communication at Thursday’s BoE policy meeting. As it is, our core view is that it will still be a little early for the BoE to shift its cautionary position and signal a June rate cut. The preference of our UK economist, James Smith, remains that the BoE cuts in August rather than June. ‘However, a June BoE rate cut is only 30% priced by the market and we doubt sterling has to rally too hard if the BoE’s language on Thursday is unchanged.’ Sterling was quoted at $1.2542 late Tuesday, lower than $1.2549 at the London equities close on Friday. The euro traded at $1.0774, higher than $1.0769. Against the yen, the dollar was quoted higher at JP¥154.49 from JP¥152.89. Back in London, easyJet fell 5.8%, while Wizz Air lost 7.1%. In Dublin, Ryanair gave back 6.2%. Budget carriers struggled after Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary cautioned that ticket prices for the summer will likely be weaker than expected. ‘Looking at summer... We thought pricing would be up 5-10%. We’re heading to flat to 5% up,’ O’Leary told reporters in Brussels, according to Reuters. Elsewhere in London, Macfarlane fell 9.9% after it reported a ‘challenging’ start to the year. ‘As anticipated, the start of 2024 has been challenging, with first quarter sales and profits below the same period in 2023,’ Macfarlane said in a trading update ahead of Tuesday’s annual general meeting. However, despite the slow start to the year, expectations for the full year are unchanged, it added. Macfarlane said first quarter sales fell 9.5% from a year prior, with continued weak customer demand and price deflation. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2%, the S&P 500 added 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1%. Disney slumped 9.8%, despite raising its annual guidance, and predicting its video streaming business will be profitable in the final-quarter of its financial year. XTB analyst Kathleen Brooks said Tuesday’s earnings were ‘no fairytale’ for the House of Mouse. ‘Disney reported a decent earnings report for last quarter on Tuesday, however, it fell short of high expectations,’ Brooks said. ‘The market may also be spooked by Disney’s comments about the current quarter’s entertainment results, which they expect to be softer than previously expected. The company has said that it expects its combined streaming business to be profitable in its Q4, however, this is not soon enough for the market, even if Disney+ subscribers rose by six million in the previous quarter.’ In Disney’s financial second quarter, which ended March 30, revenue rose 1.2% to $22.08 billion from $21.82 billion a year earlier. Net income, however, dropped by 85% to $216 million from $1.49 billion, due to $2.05 billion worth of restructuring and impairment charges, largely related to Star India. Disney in February struck a deal with Reliance Industries to merge their Indian operations, creating an $8.5 billion media powerhouse. Disney’s entertainment direct-to-consumer business, which includes the Disney+ and Hulu streaming operations, generated operating income of $47 million, swinging from a loss of $587 million. The direct-to-consumer business as a whole, so including the sports-focused ESPN+ service, generated an operating loss of $18 million, narrowing markedly from $659 million. Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger added: ‘Importantly, entertainment streaming was profitable for the quarter, and we remain on track to achieve profitability in our combined streaming businesses in Q4. ‘Looking at our company as a whole, it’s clear that the turnaround and growth initiatives we set in motion last year have continued to yield positive results. We have a number of highly anticipated theatrical releases arriving over the next few months; our television shows are resonating with audiences and critics alike; ESPN continues to break ratings records as we further its evolution into the pre-eminent digital sports platform; and we are turbocharging growth in our Experiences business with a number of near- and long-term strategic investments.’ Brent oil was trading at $82.90 a barrel at the time of the London equities close on Tuesday, lower than $82.91 late Friday.

Management said it expects the regulator to announce a decision on 12 May which, if granted means the drug could be launched in the third quarter, in time for the Autumn vaccine campaign. The company reaffirmed forecasts for 2024 product sales of $4 billion which includes a small contribution of around $170 million from sales of its RSV vaccine. Moderna shares are up nearly 50% over the last two months suggesting investors are coming around to a more positive view on the company’s post pandemic prospects. The biotech company has more than 45 products in development with several in late-stage trials. BETTER THAN EXPECTED Moderna has been working hard to get its second commercial product approved and launched into the market as sales of its Covid-19 vaccine  Spikevax  plunge. The company served-up relatively good news after booking first quarter revenue of $167 million, much better than the $97.5 million expected by analysts. In the same quarter of 2023 Moderna booked revenue of $1.86 billion. The implied 90% fall in revenue reflects the transition to a seasonal Covid-19 shot market with patients typically taking the vaccine in the Autumn and winter months. The company has made good progress reducing costs which contributed to a narrower loss per share of $3.07, compared with the $3.58 loss penciled in by Wall Street analysts. CEO Stephane Bancel said the company has done a ‘great job’ of resizing the company post pandemic. Chief financial offices James Mock said the company is ‘more encouraged by what we’re seeing from a productivity perspective’ than from the better performance of Covid vaccine sales. Moderna’s RSV vaccine will go up against  GSK’s  ( )  Arexvy and  Pfizer’s (PFE:NYSE)   Abrysvo  which are battling it out for market share. Arexvy holds around two thirds of the new RSV vaccine market and generated £1.2 billion of revenue to GSK in 2023. You can opt out at any time."},

The news sent the shares 3% higher to 748.6p, meaning they are roughly flat over the last 12 months compared with a 6% gain for the mid-cap FTSE 250 index. You know business is going well when chairman Tim Martin throws-in some humour in place of his customary barbed comments on taxes and competition from supermarkets. Martin commented: ‘The gods of fashion have smiled upon Guinness, previously consumed by blokes my age but now widely adopted by younger generations. ‘Sales of Lavazza coffee are also increasing. Free refills are thought to be responsible for spontaneous exhibitions of breakdancing among retired customers.’ HOW DID ‘SPOONS’ PERFORM? For the 13 weeks to 28 April, like-for-like   increased by 5.2% taking year to date growth to 8.3%.

Shore Capital leisure analyst Greg Johnson said Martin’s ‘chipper’ outlook was encouraging and he sees scope to ‘modestly’ lift his full year pre-tax profit estimate of £69 million. Analysts at Jefferies believe there is scope for mid-single digit percentage consensus upgrades to pre-tax profit which sits at £70 million within a range of £67 million to £75 million based-on FactSet data.

The FTSE 100 index opened up 69.25 points, 0.8%, at 8,282.95. The FTSE 250 was up 187.86 points, 0.9%, at 20,352.21, and the AIM All-Share was up 4.81 points, 0.6%, at 776.37. The Cboe UK 100 was up 0.9% at 826.93, the Cboe UK 250 was up 0.9% at 17,633.61, and the Cboe Small Companies was down 0.6% at 15,692.84. In European equities on Tuesday, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.5%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was up 0.4%. Annual growth in UK house prices quickened last month, while they returned to slight growth on a monthly basis, numbers from mortgage lender Halifax showed Tuesday. UK house price growth quickened to 1.1% year-on-year in April, Halifax said, from a 0.4% rise in March. Prices ticked up 0.1% in April from March, having fallen 0.9% in March from February. The monthly rise in April was expected to be 0.2%, according to FXStreet-cited consensus. The average UK house price in April was £288,949, up from £288,781 in March. In the US on Monday, Wall Street ended higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.5%, the S&P 500 up 1.0% and the Nasdaq Composite up 1.2%. ‘The week started on a positive note for the global equities which continue to surf on the optimism that the Federal Reserve’s next move won’t be a rate hike, which I think is overdone and that next week’s US inflation data could be a rude awakening,’ said Swissquote Bank analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya. ‘But one thing is sure, the earnings season is going well and analysts project that the S&P500 earnings will grow 17% this year.’ Sterling was quoted at $1.2538 early Tuesday, lower than $1.2549 at the London equities close on Friday. The euro traded at $1.0767 early Tuesday, lower than $1.0769 late Friday. Against the yen, the dollar was quoted higher at JP¥154.13 from JP¥152.89. In the FTSE 100, BP was one of the few losers, falling 0.9%. The oil major said replacement cost profit was down to $1.61 billion from $8.67 billion a year earlier, but up from $1.53 billion from the fourth quarter. Total first quarter revenue was down to $48.88 billion from $56.18 billion a year earlier, and down from $52.14 billion in the fourth quarter, while first quarter upstream production was 2.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 2.1% from a year earlier. BP has started a new $1.75 billion share buyback programme for the first quarter as planned, while it says a total of $3.5 billion is still planned in share buybacks for the first half of 2024. It declared a quarterly dividend of 7.27 cents per share, unchanged from the fourth quarter and up from 6.61 cents a year earlier. Looking ahead, it expects upstream production to be slightly lower in the second quarter from the first quarter, while across 2024, it expects upstream production to be slightly up from 2023 on both a reported and underlying basis. In the FTSE 250, SDCL Energy Efficiency rose 3.8%, after it agreed to sell UU Solar to UK Power for £90.8 million. The investor in assets in the energy efficiency sector said the agreed price represents a 4.5% premium to UU Solar’s September 30 valuation. SDCL Energy Efficiency said the sale proceeds will be used to reduce short term borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Elsewhere in London, Macfarlane lost 8.4%. In a trading statement ahead of its annual general meeting, the packaging company said the start of 2024 had been challenging, with first quarter sales and profit lower than a year earlier. Sales were down 9.5%, which Macfarlane blamed on continued weak customer demand and price deflation, with the profit hit being partially offset by ‘strong gross margins and the benefit of acquisitions’. Despite this, it said its expectations for the full-year were unchanged. Macfarlane expects an improved trading performance in the second half of 2024 through the ‘conversion of a strong new business pipeline combined with some sales recovery from existing customers, good management of gross margins, control of costs and further benefits from M&A activity’. In Asia on Tuesday, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo ended 1.6% higher. In China, the Shanghai Composite ended up 0.2%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was 0.7% lower in late dealings. The S&P/ASX 200 in Sydney closed up 1.4%. Brent oil was trading at $83.22 a barrel early Tuesday, higher than $82.91 late Friday. Israel carried out strikes on the Gazan city of Rafah overnight as it sought to put ‘pressure’ on Hamas ahead of talks in Egypt on Tuesday aimed at sealing a truce proposal endorsed by the militants. After having vowed for weeks to push into the southern border town, Israel called on Monday for Palestinians in eastern Rafah to leave for an ‘expanded humanitarian area’ ahead of a ground incursion. After talks earlier in the day failed to produce an agreement, Hamas said Monday evening that it had informed mediators Egypt and Qatar of its ‘approval of their proposal regarding a ceasefire’ in the seven-month-old war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the proposal ‘is far from Israel’s essential demands’, but the government would send negotiators for talks ‘to exhaust the potential for arriving at an agreement’ Gold was quoted at $2,320.62 an ounce early Tuesday, higher than $2,301.11 on Friday.

Labour costs increased 4.2% year on year in the first quarter, a similar pace to the prior quarter which gives the Fed little wriggle room to cut interest rates anytime soon. Fed chair Powell sounded dovish tones at this week’s press conference after the Fed kept interest rates on hold, playing down any fears of a pivot to higher rates and giving equity markets a slight boost. All eyes move to today’s (3 May) non-farm payrolls with economists expecting 243,000 jobs were created in April compared with 303,000 last month. Apple (APPL:NASDAQ)  was the big stock focus and the shares gained 5% in after-hours trading after the company announced its biggest ever share buyback totalling $110 billion and hiked its quarterly dividend by 4%, pleasing investors. STARBUCKS Starbucks (SBUX:NASDAQ)  shareholders were left spluttering into their cappuccinos and macchiatos after the coffee retailer served up (30 April) weaker-than-expected second quarter sales and earnings. The Seattle-headquartered coffeehouse colossus also slashed its 2024 full-year guidance, citing subdued demand in home market the US and a slower-than-expected recovery in China. A prediction from the company that its cafes will continue to underperform for several quarters spooked investors, sending the shares down 17% over the week to a one-year low of $74.4. For full year 2024, the struggling coffee giant now expects to generate low single digit revenue growth, a downgrade on earlier guidance for growth in the 7% to 10% range. CEO Laxman Narasimhan conceded the quarter ‘did not meet our expectations, but we understand the specific challenges and opportunities immediately in front of us’. He also insisted Starbucks’ ‘Triple Shot Reinvention with Two Pumps’ strategy will deliver on ‘the limitless potential of this brand’. SUPER MICRO COMPUTER When things get really hot, they usually get dropped, and investors dropped  Super Micro Computer (SMCI:NASDAQ)  en masse over the past week. The stock tanked 14% post third quarter results but working out why is another matter. Earnings didn’t really disappoint, with Q3 EPS of $6.65 per share coming in $0.85 better than the analyst estimates, although revenue was a little soft. Guidance can’t be blamed either, the $45 billion company steering Q4 EPS between $7.62 and $8.42, versus the consensus of $7.14 on a revenue range of $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion, versus the consensus of $4.89 billion. As the world hurtles into a new technological era led by AI and machine learning, Super Micro Computer’s innovative energy-efficient, liquid cooled servers are seen as must-haves by many, and analysts remain largely behind the investment story. Analysts at Loop Capital have a $1,500 price target on Super Micro stock, and they talked up June quarter guidance and subsequent quarter-on-quarter revenue ramp commentary. ‘The core of our thesis is both our net-bullish Gen AI server industry posture and as an increasing leader in the need for both complexity and scale,’ wrote Loop Capital. MCDONALD’S McDonald’s (MCD:NYSE)  missed first quarter profit expectations (30 April) for the first time in two years, suggesting past price increases are starting to bite cash strapped consumers. Global comparable sales grew 1.9% to notch-up their 13th consecutive gain but the outcome fell short of analysts’ estimates calling for 2.3% growth. The quarter saw a big deceleration compared to the 12.6% growth recorded in the same quarter of 2023. Consolidated sales came in roughly in line with estimates, showing a 4.6% increase to $6.2 billion. Adjusted EPS (earnings per share) was 2.66% ahead year on year to $2.7, slightly below the $2.72 pencilled in by analysts. Chief financial officer Ian Borden said: ‘The consumer is certainly being very discriminate in how they spend their dollar.’ CEO Chris Kempczinski described industry traffic across major markets as ‘flat to declining’ against a ‘difficult’ macro environment. The company also pointed to war in the Middle East impacting same store growth. The shares are down 8% so far in 2024 compared with a 7% gain in the S&P 500 index.     You can opt out at any time."},

The S&P 500 rose 0.9% also, while the Nasdaq Composite shot up 1.5%. Friday’s US jobs report is expected to show nonfarm payrolls rose 243,000 last month, according to FXStreet cited consensus, easing from 303,000 in March. ‘This will be an important release for the Fed as well, since the resilience in the labour market has enabled them to keep the focus on inflation. Indeed, the March report showed nonfarm payrolls rise by a 10-month high of 303,000, whilst the three-month average growth was at a 12-month high of 276,000. However, even as the nonfarm payrolls numbers have been strong, other indicators have pointed to growing weakness in the labour market, and this week’s JOLTS report for March showed that both job openings and the quits rate were down to their lowest in over three years,’ analysts at Deutsche Bank commented. SPI Asset Management analyst Stephen Innes said Fed Chair Jerome Powell may have let the ‘NFP cat out of the bag’ with his dovish post-decision press conference on Wednesday. ‘Remember, folks, this is less about inflation and more about jobs after Chair Powell, in no uncertain terms, noted that a material weakening in the labour market could precipitate rate cuts even if inflation were to remain relatively sticky and moderately elevated,’ Innes added. Apple shares rose 6.0% in after hours trade on Thursday, after the tech firm announced a new $110 billion share buyback programme. The Cupertino, California-based firm reported its second quarter results, ended March 30. Net sales fell to $90.75 billion from $94.84 billion a year earlier. Net income fell to $23.64 billion from $24.16 billion. Over the first six months of its financial year, net sales fell to $210.33 billion from $211.99 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to $57.55 billion from $54.16 billion. On the back of the results, Apple declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share, up 4% annually. The company has also authorised a $110 billion buyback programme. In London, Trainline shares shot up 7.3%. It reported expectation-beating revenue, and said net ticket sales came in at the top end of its guidance range. The travel ticketing platform also announced a new share buyback. Revenue in the year ended February 29 rose 21% to £396.7 million, from £327.1 million. Revenue topped the ‘previous guidance range’. Pretax profit jumped to £48.1 million from £22.1 million. Net ticket sales were up 22% on-year to £5.30 billion, at the top end of its previous guidance range. Chief Executive Officer Jody Ford commented: ‘New entrant carrier competition is revolutionising rail in Europe as more customers benefit from greater choice, lower prices and the opportunity to choose greener travel. We are becoming the aggregator of choice in the UK and internationally and are delivering strong growth, particularly in those markets liberalising fastest such as Spain.’ For the new financial year, it predicts net ticket sales growth of 8%-12%, and revenue to rise between 7%-11%. Trainline announced a £75.0 million share buyback programme. It recently completed a £50.0 million buyback which kicked off in September. On AIM, chartered surveyor firm Fletcher King jumped 20%. It reported a ‘strong second half business performance’, a turnaround from the more ‘cautionary business outlook’ it gave back in December. Revenue for the year ended April 30 ‘is now expected to be materially higher than management expectations’. Pretax profit is expected to be between two and three times higher than the £192,000 it reported for the prior year. Angle surged 16%. It said it has struck a deal with AstraZeneca to develop a ‘Parsortix-based androgen receptor’ detection assay to be used in prostate cancer studies. Medical diagnostics provider Angle said the deal is worth £550,000. ‘Assay development will take place in the Angle’s UK laboratories, with project completion expected in Q1 2025. A successful development phase will demonstrate the importance of the Parsortix system in assessing the efficacy of prostate cancer therapeutics and offers the potential for long-term, ongoing business for the company supporting clinical studies,’ it said. Parsortix is a liquid biopsy treatment. Angle added: ‘Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men with 1.5 million new cases diagnosed globally each year and 5 million men living with prostate cancer (5-year prevalence). The androgen receptor plays a pivotal role in prostate cancer tumour growth and progression with anti-androgen therapy frequently given as first-line treatment.’ Brent oil was quoted at $83.99 a barrel early Friday, up from $83.40 at the time of the London equities close on Thursday.

The US central bank left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but flagged a ‘lack of progress’ towards its inflation target. In a widely expected move, the Federal Reserve kept its benchmark borrowing rate in a targeted range between 5.25% to 5.50%. Powell downplayed fears that the next move on interest rates could be upwards, suggesting policy will prove restrictive enough to lower inflation. However, he also dashed hopes for a near-term rate cut, noting it was taking longer to gain confidence that inflation was on track to hit the central bank’s 2% target. In economic news Thursday, US initial jobless claims were lower than expected in the week just gone, numbers showed. According to the Department of Labor, initial claims for unemployment benefits in the week to April 27 amounted to 208,000, unchanged from a week prior. The prior reading was upwardly revised slightly from 207,000. The latest figure was below the FXStreet cited consensus of 212,000.

The London-based, Asia-focused bank reported operating income of $5.13 billion in the first quarter, a 13% increase from $4.56 billion. Pretax profit rose 5.9% to $1.91 billion from $1.81 billion, beating the company-compiled market consensus of $1.39 billion. The firm reaffirmed its previous guidance for 2024 as a whole. It plans to return ‘at least’ $5 billion to shareholders over 2024 to 2026, with its RoTE, or return on tangible equity, to ‘increase steadily’ from 10% towards a 12% target by 2026. Smurfit Kappa jumped 5.8%. The Dublin-based packaging maker said revenue in the first quarter fell 10% to €2.7 billion from €3.00 billion a year prior. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell 16% to €487 million from €579 million. Analysts at Jefferies said Ebitda was 12% ahead of its €433 million forecast. In the FTSE 250, Moneysupermarket.com rose 4.8%, after it said it will change its corporate holding company name to Mony Group. The Chester, England-based price comparison website said this reflects how the group has evolved in recent years to ‘become the UK’s leading listed tech-based savings platform’. Amongst London’s small-caps, Reach jumped 9.0%. The newspaper, magazine and digital publisher said it is on track to deliver on its full-year expectations, despite revenue falling in the first quarter of 2024. ‘We have set the business up to succeed - the decision to take cost action early, alongside the continued implementation of the customer value strategy is delivering a growing yield performance and driving results.

This performance was below expectations and dragged on shares in IHG, which have rallied 37% over the past year. Overall, first quarter global RevPar was up 2.6% year-on-year, with a weak performance from the Americas, down 0.3%. However, RevPar was up 2.5% in Greater China and 8.9% ahead in EMEAA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa).

Compared to the same quarter last year, room openings rose 11% for  Iberostar  and signings grew by 7%. In April this year, the company announced an agreement with NOVUM Hospitality that will double IHG’s presence in Germany. ‘The deal adds up to 119 hotels (17,700 rooms) or up 1.9% to our global system over the coming years,’ the company said. Despite this positive news, analysts at Jefferies viewed the hotel giant’s first quarter results ‘as a small miss’ versus their estimates and consensus. ‘While weakness in the Americas was well known, the miss came from EMEAA and Greater China.’ However, Jefferies added: ‘IHG remains a long-term compounder with a growth algorithm that rivals  Marriott’s (MAR:NASDAQ) .’ You can opt out at any time."},

The FTSE 100 index rose 28.57 points, 0.4%, at 8,149.81. The FTSE 250 edged down just 3.93 points to 19,922.66, and the AIM All-Share was up 0.50 of a point, 0.1%, at 765.48. The Cboe UK 100 was up 0.3% at 813.60, the Cboe UK 250 added 0.2% to 17,259.51, and the Cboe Small Companies was 0.4% higher at 15,829.81. In Paris and Frankfurt, where equities re-opened after public holidays on Wednesday, stocks were lower. The CAC 40 in Paris lost 0.8%. The DAX 40 in Frankfurt was down fractionally. ‘Today’s somewhat indecisive start in Europe has highlighted the mixed feelings around yesterday’s FOMC interest rate decision, with Jerome Powell treading a fine line given the recent uptick in inflation pressures. The past month saw market expectations for the first Fed rate cut pushed from June to December, although Powell managed to moderately lift hopes of an earlier shift in November. All eyes turn to Friday’s US jobs report, with the average earnings figure expected to remain at a concerning 4.1%. With the quarterly employment cost index having surged to a lofty 1.2% this week, there is a distinct risk that we could similarly see average earnings strengthen to throw another curveball in the direction of the Fed,’ Scope Markets analyst Joshua Mahony commented. The US central bank left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but flagged a ‘lack of progress’ towards its inflation target. In a widely expected move, the Federal Reserve kept its benchmark borrowing rate in a targeted range between 5.25% to 5.50%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell downplayed fears that the next move on interest rates could be upwards, suggesting policy will prove restrictive enough to lower inflation. However, he also dashed hopes for a near-term rate cut, noting it was taking longer to gain confidence that inflation was on track to hit the central bank’s 2% target. ‘It’s unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike,’ Powell told reporters. The pound was quoted at $1.2515 early Thursday afternoon, rising from $1.2487 at the time of the London equities close on Wednesday. The euro stood at $1.0704, up from $1.0679. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥155.25, down markedly from JP¥157.72. Equities in New York are called to open higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is called up 0.3%, the S&P 500 up 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.8% higher. Eyes will be on Apple, as the iPhone maker reports earnings after the closing bell on Thursday. XTB analyst Kathleen Brooks commented: ‘The Magnificent 7’s performance in Q1 has been mixed: Meta disappointed, Amazon and Google outperformed, and Tesla managed to shift the narrative around the troubled EV maker. We already know that sales of the iPhone, Apple’s flagship product, have fallen substantially in China in the first quarter, so the question is what this does to earnings. The market is expecting revenue of more than $90 billion for the quarter, which is a 5% drop on the prior quarter, with net income of $23 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.5. It is worth noting that analysts have revised down their expectations for Apple’s results in the past month. Although the bar has been lowered, it is also a sign that the market is bearish going into these results.’ In London, Standard Chartered shot up 5.6% as it affirmed financial guidance for 2024, reporting a strong start to the year. The Asia-focused bank reported operating income of $5.13 billion in the first quarter, a 13% increase from $4.56 billion. Net interest margin increased to 1.76% from 1.63%, outperforming company-compiled consensus expectations of 1.74%. Pretax profit rose 5.9% to $1.91 billion from $1.81 billion, beating the company-compiled market consensus of $1.39 billion. The firm reaffirmed its previous guidance for 2024 as a whole. In February, it had guided for operating income to increase between 5% and 7% in the period from 2024 to 2026, and around the top of this range in 2024. Net interest income for 2024 is forecast to be between $10 and $10.25 billion at constant currency. It plans to return ‘at least’ $5 billion to shareholders over 2024 to 2026, with its RoTE, or return on tangible equity, to ‘increase steadily’ from 10% towards a 12% target by 2026. HSBC, another Asia-focused lender which reported earlier this week, added 1.7%. Its stock is up some 7% so far this week. Shell added 1.1%. It launched a new $3.5 billion share buyback and delivered first quarter earnings ahead of City hopes. Chief Executive Wael Sawan commented: ‘Shell delivered another quarter of strong operational and financial performance, demonstrating our continued focus on delivering more value with less emissions.’ In the first quarter, Shell said total revenue, which includes its share of joint ventures and associates, fell 16% to $74.70 billion from $89.02 billion a year prior. Shell’s pretax profit slipped 23% to $11.04 billion from $14.35 billion a year prior. Adjusted earnings fell 20% to $7.73 billion from $9.65 billion a year prior, ahead of the $6.25 billion Bloomberg-cited consensus. Peer BP, which reports on Tuesday, added 0.2%. Smurfit Kappa added 5.0% as it said integrations plans with WestRock were ‘progressing well’, and unveiled a drop in first quarter sales and earnings, which nonetheless topped market expectations. The Dublin-based packaging maker said revenue in the first quarter fell 10% to €2.7 billion from €3.00 billion a year prior. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell 16% to €487 million from €579 million and the Ebitda margin declined to 18.0% from 19.3%. Analysts at Jefferies said Ebitda was 12% ahead of its €433 million forecast. Chief Executive Tony Smurfit called it ‘a very strong first quarter,’ reflecting the ‘continuing benefits of our multi-year capital plans.’ He noted box demand has ‘continued to improve’ with volume growth in Europe and the Americas of around 3% and 2% respectively. Smurfit said integration planning with WestRock is ‘progressing well and as expected. We remain on-track to complete the transaction in early July.’ He said the combination with WestRock would create a ‘global leader in innovative and sustainable packaging with a very exciting future for all stakeholders.’ On AIM, Kinovo surged 21%, as the provider of safety and regulatory compliance services for the property sector predicted results for the financial ended March 31 will top expectations. It expects £6.7 million in adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, up 22% from £5.5 million the previous year and ahead of the company’s £6.2 million forecast. Kinovo also expects £64 million in revenue, up 2.1% on-year from £62.7 million. Food wholesaler Kitwave declined 7.5%. It expects operating profit for the six months ended April 30 to weaken on-year. ‘This reflects lower levels of demand in the hospitality customer base of the higher margin Foodservice division, due to a historically high and sustained period of wet weather over recent months,’ Kitwave said. ‘The group has also increased investment in its infrastructure ahead of the revenue generating opportunities associated from these investments. Some of the benefits of these investments, in addition to the H2 inclusion of trade from the recent acquisition of Total Foodservice, will further increase this year’s weighting of trading toward the second half of the year.’ It added it is trading in line with market expectations for the full-year.

Every batch of hotter US data takes some conviction out of Federal Reserve rate cut bets. Earlier this year, investors hoped the Fed would cut three times in 2024. The FTSE 100 index was up 39.24 points, or 0.5%, at 8,210.85. The FTSE 250 was up 67.82 points, or 0.4%, at 17,415.21, and the AIM All-Share was up 65.96 points, or 0.5%, at 14,314.807. The Cboe UK 100 was up 0.5% at 819.96, the Cboe UK 250 was up 0.4% at 17,413.98, and the Cboe Small Companies was down 0.1% at 15,762.31. In European equities on Friday, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.2%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was up 0.5%. Stocks in New York were called higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was called up 0.8%, the S&P 500 index up 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.6%. Friday’s US jobs report is expected to show nonfarm payrolls rose 243,000 last month, according to FXStreet cited consensus, easing from 303,000 in March. ‘This will be an important release for the Fed as well, since the resilience in the labour market has enabled them to keep the focus on inflation. Indeed, the March report showed nonfarm payrolls rise by a 10-month high of 303,000, whilst the three-month average growth was at a 12-month high of 276,000,’ Deutsche Bank analysts commented. Interest rates were left unchanged on Wednesday by the US Federal Reserve, on a ‘lack of progress’ towards its inflation target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell downplayed fears that the next move on interest rates could be upwards, suggesting policy will prove restrictive enough to lower inflation. However, he also dashed hopes for a near-term rate cut noting it was taking longer to gain confidence that inflation was on track to hit the central bank’s 2% target. According to Eurostat, unemployment in the eurozone remained unchanged on-month in March. The seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was stable at 6.5% compared to February, and down slightly from 6.6% in March 2023. The most recent figure was in line with the FXStreet-cited consensus. The pound was quoted at $1.2554 at midday on Friday in London, up compared to $1.2487 at the equities close on Thursday. The euro stood at $1.0748, up against $1.0690. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥153.06, down compared to JP¥154.05. In London, Anglo American gained 3.3%, after Reuters reported Glencore could launch a rival bid for the mining company. The company is in preliminary discussions with its mining peer over a potential takeover, though no formal offer has been made. This comes amid ongoing interest in Anglo American from BHP. Last Friday, Anglo American ‘unanimously’ rejected an ‘opportunistic’ offer from BHP on grounds that it ‘significantly undervalues’ the London-based miner. The all-share offer valued the miner at £31.1 billion. Trainline gained 6.6%, after posting expectation-beating revenue, and said net ticket sales came in at the top end of its guidance range. The travel ticketing platform also announced a new share buyback. Revenue in the year ended February 29 rose 21% to £396.7 million, from £327.1 million. Revenue topped the ‘previous guidance range’. Pretax profit jumped to £48.1 million from £22.1 million. Net ticket sales were up 22% on-year to £5.30 billion, at the top end of its previous guidance range. For the new financial year, it predicts net ticket sales growth of 8%-12%, and revenue to rise between 7%-11%. Trainline announced a £75.0 million share buyback programme. It recently completed a £50.0 million buyback which kicked off in September. On AIM, chartered surveyor firm Fletcher King jumped 26%. It reported a ‘strong second half business performance’, a turnaround from the more ‘cautionary business outlook’ it gave back in December. Revenue for the year ended April 30 ‘is now expected to be materially higher than management expectations’. Pretax profit is expected to be between two and three times higher than the £192,000 it reported for the prior year. Stocks in New York were called higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was called up 0.8%, the S&P 500 index up 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.7%. Brent oil was quoted at $83.91 a barrel at midday in London on Friday, from $83.40 late Thursday. Of the black stuff, Panmure’s Ashley Kelty argued that while crude inventory builds ‘suggest softer demand’, ‘peak driving season is now underway’, which could help with a clearer picture of demand growth in coming weeks. Kelty added: ‘While tensions in the Middle East continue to elicit a risk premium (albeit greatly reduced) there has been no material disruption to supplies of crude, and a wider regional conflict looks increasingly unlikely. OPEC has indicated it may extend quota cuts if demand fails to pick up to forecast levels in near term. Reports suggest the cartel members are discussing this informally, but traders will keep an eye on rhetoric ahead of the group’s next formal meeting.’ Gold was quoted at $2,300.35 an ounce, down against $2,303.10.

The rings-to-lab-grown diamonds seller’s confident outlook demonstrated that its ‘Phoenix’ growth strategy, which entails ‘elevating brand desirability’ and a step-up in marketing and investments in new store openings, is paying off. The charm bracelets-to-necklaces purveyor also stressed that trading in the second quarter to date has ‘remained healthy’ with high single-digit like-for-like growth, sending the shares 6% higher to DKK 1,148 on Thursday, or approximately £131.62. BLING FOR THE MASSES Copenhagen-headquartered   is a vertically integrated jewellery maker and seller that plays in the accessible luxury market, making high-quality bling available to the many. The company now sees annual organic sales growth in the 8% to 10% range, up from previous guidance of 6% to 9%, although operating margin guidance was left unchanged at ‘around 25%’. The upgrade followed the delivery of 18% organic growth in the first quarter, during which Pandora’s gross margin reached a new record-high of 79.4%, up 190 basis points year-on-year, supported by price increases, efficiencies and tailwinds from silver prices and foreign exchange rates. Operating profit jumped 20% to DKK1.51 billion, with total sales for Pandora’s lab-grown diamond collection reaching DKK 63 million with sparkling like-for-like growth of 87%. CHINA DISAPPOINTS While the US market continued to exhibit sustained strength, with Pandora notching up 9% like-for-like growth in Q1, and key European markets delivered solid growth, China had a challenging quarter. Like-for-like sales slumped 17% in the Middle Kingdom amid challenging market conditions, although Pandora remains committed to ‘navigating the market’s complexities’ and ‘driving positive change through the gradual relaunch of the brand’ in China. WHAT DID THE CEO SAY? CEO Alexander Lacik said: ‘We are very pleased with our start to the year, as we embark on the next chapter of Phoenix. Whilst jewellery markets around us generally remain subdued, our ongoing brand investments allow us to take market share. We raise our revenue guidance and look forward to keep fuelling our growth with exciting strategic initiatives over the coming years.’ Pandora, which initiated a fresh DKK4 billion share buyback in February, sounded upbeat about its prospects in a jewellery market that has historically grown faster than GDP and remains highly fragmented, with global brands set to outgrow the overall market.

As expected, the group reported a decline in like-for-like revenue against a strong prior-year quarter but importantly it maintained its full-year guidance. The shares gave up 35p or 1.2% to £32.33 in response. SOFTER QUARTER For the first three months of 2024 Spectris reported sales of £309.4 million, an 8% decline against last year’s £354 million on a like-for-like basis. Spectris Scientific sales were down 6% against a 26% increase last year, driven by lower life sciences and university spending, while Dynamic sales were down 10% against a 21% increase last year, driven by machine manufacturing and automotive end markets. While comparisons with last year’s first quarter – when group revenue jumped 24% - were always going to be tough, sales were slightly softer than the firm expected, notably in China, although chief executive Andrew Heath expects the trend to improve over the course of the year with the results being second-half weighted. Nevertheless, the first quarter of 2024 was ‘another productive period for the group’, said Heath. ‘We've successfully implemented the initial rollout of our new ERP system, launched a number of new, market-leading products and completed the sale of Red Lion, which represents the end of our portfolio rationalisation programme.’ Meanwhile, with the sale of Red Lion generating net proceeds of £228 million, the company’s balance sheet gives it significant scope to fund growth both through new products, where increased R&D (research and development) spending is driving ‘an accelerated cadence of new product launches’ this year, and through bolt-on M&A (mergers and acquisitions) where there is ‘an encouraging pipeline’ of deals   Heath. FULL-YEAR OUTLOOK CONFIRMED Thanks to the group’s leading product portfolio and broad end-market-exposure, backed by the launch of new products and what it calls ‘a strong self-help story’, Spectris maintained its outlook for the year despite the ‘uncertain’ macroeconomic environment’. Operating margins are also expected to expand towards the firm’s target of 20% while earnings are supported by accretive M&A and the ongoing share buyback. You can opt out at any time."},

But he also dashed hopes for a near-term rate cut, noting it was taking longer to gain confidence that inflation was on track to hit the central bank’s 2% target. Powell said he believed policy was ‘restrictive’ and expects over time, it will be ‘sufficiently restrictive’. In a widely expected move, the Federal Reserve kept its benchmark short-term borrowing rate in a targeted range between 5.25% to 5.50%. The federal funds rate has been at that level since July 2023, when the Fed last hiked rates, which took the range to its highest level in more than two decades. In a statement at the conclusion of its two-day meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee said inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated. ‘Comments from Fed Chair Powell after the latest US Federal Reserve policy meeting that pushed back against the possibility that the next policy move would be an interest rate hike. He did, however, acknowledge recent strong data, including signs that disinflation has stalled. Nevertheless, he said that he still thought policy was sufficiently restrictive, although the implication seemed to be that cuts will probably take longer to occur than was previously expected. Overall, his comments were more hawkish than the Fed’s last update in March but were less hawkish than markets feared,’ analysts at Lloyds Bank commented.

Spectris fell 3.5%, it backed annual guidance but reported a ‘slightly softer than anticipated’ first-quarter. The supplier of high-tech instruments, test equipment and software for industrial applications said first-quarter sales were 8% lower on a like-for-like basis. Chief Executive Andrew Heath said: ‘While conditions in some of our end markets were softer than expected in the first quarter, notably China, we continue to expect to deliver progress this year as markets improve, with progress weighted towards the second half. As a higher quality, more resilient business, facing off to attractive markets, we are well placed to deliver continued organic growth, expand operating margins towards our target of 20%+ and compound growth through M&A.’ Daily Mirror owner Reach leapt 8.4%, while Smiths News, a distributor of newspapers, climbed 4.5%. Reach said revenue in the first-quarter of 2024 slipped 6.7% on-year, with advertising revenue alone down 11%. Print revenue, which as well as advertising also includes circulation, declined 6.0%. Circulation revenue dropped 3.4%. Revenue in the digital offering slipped 8.5%. ‘The factors affecting trading in Q1 remain unchanged from those outlined at the full year results with performance continuing to be robust. These include the well publicised deprioritisation of news during 2023 by major platforms which meant that year-on-year page views declined 33%. This has been partially offset by the strengthening yield per page,’ Reach said. ‘In Print, circulation revenues remain a predictable and reliable revenue stream with the expected volume decline mitigated by actions on cover prices and availability. Print advertising revenue outperformed volume trends due to higher spend levels from advertisers.’ It said it is on track for its 2023 expectations, noting adjusted operating profit consensus of £97.6 million. Adjusted operating profit in 2022 had slipped 9.0% to £96.5 million. Smiths News reported weaker first-half earnings but expects an annual outcome in line with market expectations.

The removal of this restriction will enable the company to implement its revised capital allocation policy.’ Brent oil was quoted at $83.96 a barrel early Thursday, up from $83.78 late Wednesday.

After initially opening higher the shares fell back 2% on worries over lower pricing of  Wegovy  in the US and slower than expected growth in the obesity franchise. Investor excitement about the market potential for weight-loss drugs has sent the shares soaring 55% over the last year, briefly making Novo Nordisk Europe’s most valuable company. HOW DID NOVO PERFORM? Sales increased 24% to DKK (Danish Kroner) 65.3 billion (£7.5 billion) in Q1, while sales of  Wegovy  more than doubled to DKK 9.38 billion and net profit increased 28% to DKK 25.4 billion, ahead of consensus forecasts of DKK 23.7 billion. CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen said: ‘We are pleased with the sales growth in the first three months of 2024, driven by increased demand for our GLP-1-based diabetes and obesity treatments. ‘More patients benefit from our innovative treatments, and the agreement to acquire the three Catalent manufacturing sites will enable us to serve significantly more people living with diabetes and obesity in the future.’ The company increased its sales growth outlook for 2024 to between 19% and 27% and upped its operating profit growth expectation to between 22% to 30% from 21% to 29%. EXPERT VIEW AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould commented: ‘For a company at the centre of the weight loss drug phenomenon, it’s ironic investors are judging Novo Nordisk by how much bacon it brings home. The market wants to see it fatten up profits and enjoy financial gains from others’ quest to drop the pounds. ‘Competition is growing in the market but demand is so high that Novo Nordisk is still racing to keep up with supplies, not fretting about what a rival like Eli Lilly is doing. However, the more products on the market and broader availability of each treatment, the greater the chance that prices will come down. ‘This is already happening in the US. It means Novo Nordisk is facing the likelihood that weight loss treatments become lower margin in time, hence why it needs to ramp up volumes as fast as possible as the dial shifts from earnings quality to earnings quantity.’ Disclaimer: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in the article owns Shares magazine.

The FTSE 100 index closed down 22.89 points, 0.3%, at 8,121.24. The FTSE 250 ended down 38.80 points, 0.2%, at 19,926.59, and the AIM All-Share closed up 4.24 points, 0.6%, at 764.98. The Cboe UK 100 ended down 0.3% at 811.07, the Cboe UK 250 closed down 0.4% at 17,230.04, and the Cboe Small Companies ended up 0.2% at 15,762.48. Financial markets in Paris and Frankfurt are closed on Wednesday. The Fed announces its latest interest rate decision at 1900 BST. A press conference with Chair Jerome Powell follows half an hour later. ‘It’s decision day on interest rates in the US and while the Federal Reserve is almost certain to stick with the status quo, there will be considerable interest in the accompanying commentary. Will markets have to get used to the idea of zero cuts in 2024, having started the year with hopes for rates to be materially lowered?’ said AJ Bell’s Russ Mould. Before the Fed decision, there has been a flurry of US data. The US private sector added more jobs than expected last month, numbers from payroll firm ADP showed. According to the latest ADP tracker, private employers added 192,000 jobs in April, rising from 184,000 in March. The March reading was downwardly revised from an initially reported 208,000. The latest reading beat the FXStreet cited consensus of 175,000. The US manufacturing sector was stable in April, purchasing managers’ index survey results from S&P Global confirmed on Wednesday, but data from the Institute for Supply Management showed the sector fell into contraction. The S&P Global US manufacturing PMI posted in line with the 50.0 no-change mark in April to point to stable business conditions at the start of the second quarter. The reading was down from 51.9 in March and signalled an end to a three-month sequence of improving operating conditions. The ISM PMI reported that economic activity in the manufacturing sector contracted in April after one month of expansion following 16 consecutive months of contraction. The ISM PMI for manufacturing reading slipped to 49.2 points in April from 50.3 in March. Stocks in New York were mixed at the London equities close. The DJIA was up 0.2%, though the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq Composite were down 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively. The pound was quoted at $1.2487 at the London equities close Wednesday, down compared to $1.2523 at the close on Tuesday. The euro stood at $1.0679 at the European equities close Wednesday, lower against $1.0690 at the same time on Tuesday. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥157.72, up compared to JP¥157.44 late Tuesday. In the FTSE 100, Haleon lost 3.1%. The Surrey, England-based consumer health arm, spun out of GSK PLC, backed its annual guidance and reported a ‘solid’ quarter. Revenue declined 2.2% on-year to £2.92 billion in the three months that ended March 31, as revenue for Haleon’s Pain Relief and Respiratory Health units fell amid a weaker Covid season in China compared to a year ago. Cost of sales were reduced by 5.7% to £1.08 billion from £1.15 billion, helping pretax profit to grow by 8.9% to £590 million from £542 million. On the other hand, GSK rose 1.6%. The London-based pharmaceutical maker said revenue in the first-quarter of the year was up 5.9% to £7.36 billion from £6.95 billion a year prior. Pretax profit, however, weakened 29% to £1.36 billion from £1.91 billion. In the FTSE 250, Aston Martin lost 6.8%, after a disappointing trading update. The company reported 945 vehicle sales in the first quarter, down 26% from 1,269 a year before. Pretax loss widened 87% to £138.8 million from £74.2 million. Executive Chair Lawrence Stroll said: ‘2024 is a year of immense product transformation at Aston Martin, with the introduction of four new models to the market before the end of the year. Our first quarter performance reflects this expected period of transition, as we ceased production and delivery of our outgoing core models ahead of the ramp up in production of the new Vantage, upgraded DBX707 and our upcoming V12 flagship sports car which we’ve confirmed today. As part of our ongoing programme of ultra-exclusive models, we will deliver a new Special in the fourth quarter of the year.’ On AIM, Trinity Exploration & Production rose 53%. Touchstone Exploration shares fell 4.5%. Touchstone Exploration said it reached an agreement to buy Trinity Exploration & Production. The Trinidad & Tobago-focused oil exploration and production companies aim to become ‘a leading Trinidadian operator of scale,’ according to Touchstone, which calls itself the largest independent onshore oil and natural gas producer in Trinidad. The all-share agreement values Trinity at £24.1 million. Brent oil was quoted at $83.78 a barrel at the London equities close Wednesday, down from $86.42 late Tuesday.

Net debt (debt minus cash on the balance sheet) soared in Q1, hitting  £1.04 billion. That’s up £230 million in the past three months.  ‘The company’s valuation is a fraction of what it was when it listed back in 2018, rendering initial comparisons with Ferrari as ridiculous as setting a park jogger up against an Olympic middle-distance runner’, said AJ Bell’s Mould. ‘Despite a recent refinancing, Aston Martin is still burdened with a hefty debt pile and it’s likely in the last chance saloon at this point.

It is expected to keep rates on hold this week, with Chair Jerome Powell likely to say that the central bank is not yet confident enough to cut as inflation remains lofty. ‘Mood among investors is not cheery into the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy decision due later today. And it’s understandable. The Fed must respond to a three straight month jump in inflation and probably take a step back in its plans to cut the interest rates this year. There is even a risk that the Fed drops the expectation of a rate cut in 2024,’ Swissquote analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya commented. The economic calendar for Wednesday has a UK manufacturing PMI at 0930 BST. In the afternoon, there is the US ADP jobs report at 1315 BST, before the Fed decision in the evening. The ADP data is expected to show employment in the US private sector grew by 175,000 last month, according to FXStreet cited consensus, easing from 184,000 in March. The official nonfarm payrolls follow on Friday, with jobs growth of 245,000 expected, easing from 303,000 in March. Brown Brothers Harriman analysts commented: ‘Of note, non-farm payrolls has outperformed ADP for eight straight months.’ In London, Smith & Nephew shares rose 3.5%, the best large-cap performer. The medical devices maker said first-quarter revenue rose 2.2% on a reported basis to $1.39 billion from $1.36 billion. ‘Revenue growth in the first quarter was driven by solid performance in our Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine & ENT businesses, partially offset by some anticipated softness in Advanced Wound Management,’ Chief Executive Officer Deepak Nath said. ‘We are confident in our outlook and look forward to all three of our business units contributing as we deliver another year of strong revenue growth.’ Smith & Nephew maintained annual guidance, expecting reporting revenue growth of 4.3% to 5.3%. GSK added 0.7% as it raised annual guidance. Shingles drug, Shingrix, was one stand-out performer in its first-quarter, but the drugmaker reported momentum across all business areas. Haleon fell 1.9%. GSK’s former consumer healthcare business backed yearly guidance, but said reported revenue was lower amid a weaker Covid season in China in the first quarter of the year compared to a year ago. Next fell 1.0% as it reported a first-quarter that went ahead of plan, but maintained its outlook as it predicts the second-quarter will be more tepid. In the 13 weeks to April 27, its first-quarter, full price sales rose 5.7% on-year. The outcome was ahead of guidance, with the clothing and homewares seller having predicted growth of 5%. It still expects pretax profit to grow 4.6% in the full-year to £960 million. Next added: ‘We are maintaining our guidance for full price sales in the first half to be up 2.5%. This implies that our sales in Q2 will be down -0.3%. We expect the sales performance in the second quarter to be weaker than the first quarter because last year benefited from particularly warm weather from late May through to the end of June.’ Aston Martin shares fell 7.6%, the worst mid-cap performer as it recorded weaker results, for a first-quarter of a year it is labelling a ‘period of transition’. The carmaker said revenue in the first-quarter fell 10% to £267.7 million from £295.9 million a year earlier. Its pretax loss widened to £138.8 million from £74.2 million. Executive Chair Lawrence Stroll commented: ‘2024 is a year of immense product transformation at Aston Martin, with the introduction of four new models to the market before the end of the year.

As part of our ongoing programme of ultra-exclusive models, we will deliver a new Special in the fourth quarter of the year.’ It expects a second-quarter performance to be ‘broadly similar’ to the first. Edison analyst Neil Shah commented: ‘Looking ahead, despite the current headwinds, AML maintains its 2024 guidance and medium-term targets, with anticipated positive free cash flow generation in H2 and beyond. These results reflect a transformative phase for AML, symbolised by the impending arrival of incoming CEO Adrian Hallmark. His appointment, slated for no later than October, signals a strategic shift as the company navigates a transition away from outgoing models towards a more sustainable future.’ On AIM, Trinity Exploration surged 47%. Touchstone Exploration fell 4.4%. Touchstone said it has struck an all-share deal to acquire Trinity. The all-share agreement values the latter at £24.1 million. Touchstone Exploration, an oil and natural gas exploration and production active in Trinidad & Tobago, said the deal will create a ‘leading Trinidadian operator of scale’. It said: ‘The addition of Trinity’s existing production portfolio, along with its exploration and development assets, will position the combined group as one of the leading independent operating companies dedicated to investing in both onshore and offshore activity to grow Trinidadian oil and gas production.’ As part of the deal, Trinity shareholders will receive 1.5 new Touchstone shares for each Trinity share owned. Trinity Shareholders will own just under 20% of the combined firm. Trinity directors consider the terms of the deal to be ‘fair and reasonable’.

HSBC said it has approved a first interim dividend of $0.10 per share, up year-on-year from $0.09. It will also pay a special dividend of $0.21 following the sale of its Canadian banking business.

Total revenue in the quarter was 6.2% higher year-on-year at £199.7 million from £188.1 million. It added: ‘Looking ahead to the remainder of the financial year, we are pleased to see momentum continue into April as clients take advantage of the benefits of investing at the start of the tax year. We continue to make good progress against our priorities for the year - improving our client proposition, controlling our costs and increasing our execution pace so that we can capitalise on the significant growth opportunities that lie ahead and create value for all our stakeholders.’ Panmure Gordon analysts commented: ‘It has been popular among commentators to write Hargreaves Lansdown off of late, but it appears that clients disagree. ‘It would be premature to call a lasting turn, cost of living pressures are still a material feature, but this is a good update and certainly a better performance than is discounted in the share price.’ On AIM, essensys slumped 29% as the provider of software and cloud services for the flexible workspace industry posted a half-year revenue decline.

The FTSE 100 index closed down 2.90 points at 8,144.13. The FTSE 250 ended down 119.40 points, 0.6%, at 19,965.39, and the AIM All-Share closed down 2.59 points, 0.3%, at 760.74. The Cboe UK 100 ended down 0.1% at 813.44, the Cboe UK 250 closed down 0.2% at 17,294.57, and the Cboe Small Companies ended up 0.1% at 15,727.95. In European equities on Tuesday, the CAC 40 in Paris closed down 1.0% and the DAX 40 in Frankfurt ended up 1.1%. The Federal Open Market Committee meeting kicked off Tuesday, with a decision scheduled on Wednesday. The Fed is expected to leave rates unmoved, with focus on what Chair Jerome Powell has to say at a subsequent press conference. The decision will be announced at 1900 BST. Analysts at Brown Brothers Harriman said they are expecting to ‘see a hawkish hold.’ James Knightley at ING also anticipates ‘a hawkish shift.’ Stocks in New York were lower at the London equities close. The DJIA and the Nasdaq Composite were both down 0.8%, while the S&P 500 index was down 0.7%. The pound was quoted at $1.2523 at the London equities close Tuesday, down compared to $1.2554 at the close on Monday. The euro stood at $1.0690 at the European equities close Tuesday, lower against $1.0717 at the same time on Monday. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥157.44, higher compared to JP¥156.64 late Monday. In the FTSE 100, Whitbread rose 3.9%. In the 52 weeks to February 29, the Premier Inn owner said pretax profit rose 21% to £451.7 million from £374.9 million a year prior. Sales rose 13% to £2.96 billion from £2.63 billion. Reflecting the strong financial performance, Whitbread said it intends to start a further £150 million share buy-back, which will be completed during the first half of the new financial year. It also increased the total dividend by 31% to 97.0p per share from 74.2p. Whitbread said it plans to convert a large number of restaurants into hotel rooms, and sell-off underperforming sites, as it looks to hit a target of 97,000 open rooms in the UK by 2029. The plan will result in the loss of 1,500 jobs. HSBC rose 4.1%. The London-based, Asia-focused lender said first-quarter net interest income fell 3.4% to $8.65 billion from $8.96 billion year-on-year, though came in higher than company-compiled consensus of $8.50 billion. Net operating income increased 1.5% to $20.03 billion from $19.74 billion. Pretax profit was $12.65 billion, 1.8% lower than the prior year’s $12.89 billion, but ahead of $12.61 billion consensus. HSBC noted the figure included a $4.8 billion gain following the disposal of its Canadian banking business, which was partially offset by a $1.1 billion impairment related to the sale of its business in Argentina. HSBC said Chief Executive Noel Quinn has informed the board of his intention to retire from the bank after nearly five years leading the company, and 37 years at the firm in total. Quinn said he plans to ‘pursue a portfolio career’ going forward. On the other hand, Prudential lost 5.5%. The Asia-focused insurer said first quarter new business profit, excluding economic impacts, rose 11% at constant exchange rates to $810 million, compared to $727 million a year prior. But, after allowing for economic impacts, new business profit was broadly unchanged at $726 million. In the FTSE 250, Hargreaves Lansdown rose 3.6%. The Bristol, England-based wealth management platform reported net new business of £1.6 billion for the three months that ended March 31, the company’s financial third quarter. This was unchanged from the same period a year before, but up sharply from £400 million in the second quarter ended December 31. Assets under administration rose by 5.3% to £149.7 billion on March 31, a record, from £142.2 billion on December 31 and £132.0 billion a year before. Amongst London’s small-caps, Petrofac plummeted 29%. It warned at the start of the week that a financial restructuring could see a chunk of its debt converted to equity, resulting in dilution of existing shareholders. The energy infrastructure company also flagged an extra $130 million charge in its engineering and construction division and said the release of full-year results would be delayed. Brent oil was quoted at $86.42 a barrel at the London equities close Tuesday, down from $87.27 late Monday. Gold was quoted at $2,298.10 an ounce at the London equities close Tuesday, lower against $2,337.40 at the close on Monday. In Wednesday’s UK corporate calendar, there are first quarter results from GSK. There are trading statements from Next and Smith & Nephew.

These were robust results, showing its e-commerce business made money both in North America and overseas, something that hasn’t happened since 2021, while cloud giant Amazon Web Services, or AWS, posted accelerating sales growth and much stronger operating profit margins that hit double-digits for the first time on record. Coming in at 10.7% in the quarter, that was up from 7.8% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and topped a previous best of 8.2% in Q1 2021. Overall operating profits more than tripled. OODLES OF CASH Cash flow was also notably improved. Amazon burned cash in 2021 and 2022, forcing it to borrow money to fund investment, before reversing strongly in 2023, and it surged again in Q1 2024. As Amazon finance chief Brian Olsavsky noted on an investor call, Amazon is now paying down debt while also building up cash reserves. That ensures it can handle the capital expenditure demands of AI. Like other companies, Amazon executives said capex would rise this year. You can understand, then, why Amazon hasn’t followed  Meta Platforms (META:NASDAQ)  and  Alphabet (GOOG:NASDAQ)  in introducing a dividend or even spending money on stock buybacks. ‘Apart from the lack of a dividend, Amazon delivered a lot of good news for investors’, said AJ Bell’s investment director Russ Mould. WHAT AMAZON IS CAPABLE OF ‘Dividends aside, the latest results were a shining example of what Amazon is capable of achieving. Sales, profit and cash flow continue to build, delivery is getting faster for its retail arm which is a key differentiator for the company versus competitors, and the introduction of advertising on its streaming platform provides another revenue growth lever. ‘The all-important artificial intelligence theme got its moment in the sun via the widespread launch of Amazon Q, a generative AI-powered assistant for accelerating software development and leveraging companies’ internal data’, said Mould. Investors may have been disappointed, hence the lukewarm early share price response in after-hours trading, before rallying. Amazon stock is seen opening later today up 2.3% at $179, implying a rough 18% year-to-date gain. Disclaimer: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in the article owns Shares magazine.

The FTSE 100 index slipped just 1.15 points to 8,142.98. The FTSE 250 was down 35.58 points, 0.2%, at 19,929.81, and the AIM All-Share was up 3.07 points, 0.4%, at 763.81. The Cboe UK 100 was flat at 813.38, the Cboe UK 250 fell 0.2% to 17,252.36, and the Cboe Small Companies was up 0.1% at 15,743.17. Financial markets in Paris and Frankfurt are closed on Wednesday. The Fed announces its latest interest rate decision at 1900 BST. A press conference with Chair Jerome Powell follows half an hour later. Scope Markets analyst Joshua Mahony commented: ‘Today sees the Federal Reserve step up to the plate once again, with Jerome Powell holding the markets in his hands. Recent concerns around a resurgence in inflation pressures have pushed back the expected rate cuts that had until recently been scheduled to commence next month. The market pricing for a June rate cut has shifted from 56% to just 6% in the past month, but even more incredibly we have seen it pushed all the way back to December, bypassing three meetings in the process. ‘With the Fed’s March dot plot having laid out plans to cut three times this year, it is evident that the recent inflationary surge has similarly taken Powell and his colleagues off-guard. Today is the opportunity for him to set new expectations, and there is understandable concern that this meeting will be dominated by a more hawkish tone. Given the dramatic shift in expectations by the markets, bulls will hope that Powell could provide a glimmer of hope that things may not be as bad as markets are portraying.’ While the Fed is not slated to release another summary of economic projections, the press conference following the decision offers a chance for Chair Powell to offer some thoughts on the US interest rate outlook. With a rate cut hat-trick for 2024 now a distant prospect, the dollar has been supported. The pound was quoted at $1.2485 early Wednesday, down from $1.2523 at the time of the London equities close on Tuesday. The euro stood at $1.0660, down from $1.0690. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥157.95, up from JP¥157.44. Pepperstone analyst Michael Brown said the ‘tide’ could turn on the dollar soon, however. ‘Although the USD has gained ground against all G10 peers since the turn of the year, signs are starting to emerge that the tide may well be turning against the greenback, as Fed pricing reaches ’max hawk’, growth appears to soften, and geopolitical risk seems to dissipate,’ Brown added. Still to come on Wednesday is the latest US ADP jobs report at 1315 BST. Equities in New York are called to open lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is called down 0.3%, the S&P 500 down 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.8% lower. In London, Smith & Nephew shares rose 2.7%, the best large-cap performer. The medical devices maker said first-quarter revenue rose 2.2% on a reported basis to $1.39 billion from $1.36 billion. ‘Revenue growth in the first quarter was driven by solid performance in our Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine & ENT businesses, partially offset by some anticipated softness in Advanced Wound Management,’ Chief Executive Officer Deepak Nath said. ‘We are confident in our outlook and look forward to all three of our business units contributing as we deliver another year of strong revenue growth.’ Smith & Nephew maintained annual guidance, expecting reporting revenue growth of 4.3% to 5.3%. GSK added 1.9% as it raised annual guidance. Shingles drug, Shingrix, was one stand-out performer in its first-quarter, but the drugmaker reported momentum across all business areas. The London-based pharmaceutical maker said revenue in the first-quarter of the year was up 5.9% to £7.36 billion from £6.95 billion a year prior. Pretax profit, however, weakened 29% to £1.36 billion from £1.91 billion. GSK reported ’other’ expenses worth £533 million, swinging from £297 million in gains a year prior and hurting its bottom line. Cost of sales rose 1.5% to £1.97 billion from £1.94 billion. GSK now expects annual revenue to rise at the upper part of its 5% to 7% range, at constant currency. It expects constant currency operating profit growth in its core operations of 9% to 11%, its outlook raised from 7% to 10%. Core earnings per share growth of 8% to 10% at constant currency is now expected, the guidance bumped up from 6% to 9%. Aston Martin shares went into reverse, losing 5.2%, sitting at the rear of the FTSE 250. The Gaydon, England-based carmaker said revenue in the first-quarter fell 10% to £267.7 million from £295.9 million a year earlier. Its pretax loss widened 87% to £138.8 million from £74.2 million. The company reported 945 vehicle sales, down 26% from 1,269. AJ Bell analyst Russ Mould commented: ‘Luxury car manufacturer Aston Martin has been sent to the stock market equivalent of the scrapyard after struggling to kick into gear. The company has reported a doubling of losses in the first quarter and missed expectations across the board – including on volumes. Aston Martin has stopped production on some of its core models ahead of the launch of a new range of vehicles which the company expects to power growth in the second half of this year and beyond, but there is little reason for investors to place any faith in this strategy. ‘The company’s valuation is a fraction of what it was when it listed back in 2018, rendering initial comparisons with Ferrari as ridiculous as setting a park jogger up against an Olympic middle-distance runner. Despite a recent refinancing, Aston Martin is still burdened with a hefty debt pile and it’s likely in the last chance saloon at this point. If the new launches don’t go well it’s hard to see what road the business can take next.’ On AIM, there was some M&A impetus for Trinity Exploration and Alpha Financial Markets Consulting shares. Alpha Financial Markets Consulting rose 39% after it confirmed private equity interest. It has a market capitalisation of £531.5 million. It said it has received a non-binding indicative proposal from Bridgepoint Advisers, and added that Cinven is also mulling an offer. The duo have until the close of play on May 29 to confirm whether they plan to make an offer for the specialist consultancy services provider. Trinity Exploration surged 43%, while Touchstone Exploration fell 3.9%. Touchstone said it has struck an all-share deal to acquire Trinity. The all-share agreement values the latter at £24.1 million. Touchstone Exploration, an oil and natural gas exploration and production active in Trinidad & Tobago, said the deal will create a ‘leading Trinidadian operator of scale’. It said: ‘The addition of Trinity’s existing production portfolio, along with its exploration and development assets, will position the combined group as one of the leading independent operating companies dedicated to investing in both onshore and offshore activity to grow Trinidadian oil and gas production.’ As part of the deal, Trinity shareholders will receive 1.5 new Touchstone shares for each Trinity share owned. Trinity shareholders will own just under 20% of the combined firm. Trinity directors consider the terms of the deal to be ‘fair and reasonable’.

Traders took the opportunity to top-slice the shares, which have gained over 12% this year, sending them lower by 72p or 0.8%. OUTLOOK UNCHANGED Having guided the market to expect a 5% rise in full-price sales for the quarter to 27 April, the Leicestershire-based firm delivered a 5.7% increase driven by online sales which rose 8.8% over the period. For the second quarter, where sales were forecast to be flat due to a strong comparable period last helped by exceptionally warm weather from late May into June, the group trimmed its guidance to a dip of 0.3% so as to leave first-half sales up 2.5% in line with its original target. The outlook for full-year full-price sales was left   at £4.9 billion, an increase of 2.5%, while group revenue including markdowns and sales from subsidiary brands such as Fat Face and Reiss are seen rising 6% to £6.2 billion. Pre-tax profit guidance was also left unchanged at £960 million, with EPS attributable to shareholders seen rising 4.8% to 606.3p per share. OUTPERFORMING THE MARKET For full-price sales to have increased by 5.7% in the three months to the end of April, Next is clearly outperforming the both the clothing and household goods markets. According to the ONS (Office for National Statistics), in value terms clothing sales rose very slightly in March but were down by 1.7% on average in the prior three months while household goods sales were down in March for a seventh consecutive month (April sales will be released in mid-May). Data collected by Barclaycard showed similar trends, with clothing sales down more than 1% on average each month from December to March and overall household spending down by an average of 6% each month over the same period. The BRC (British Retail Consortium) reported weaker sales of clothing and footwear in March due to wet weather, although it said homewares and home textiles were popular with consumers sprucing up their homes ahead of Spring. ‘As April signals big increases in the sector’s cost base – through the rise in minimum wage rates and business rate hikes for the larger high street brands – retailers will be hoping that the bounce back of March sales is more than just an Easter blip’, commented Linda Ellett, UK head of consumer markets at KPMG which compiles the retail sales monitor in conjunction with the BRC.

After languishing around the £30 level to begin with, the shares slowly climbed 110p or 3.5% to £31.50 by late morning. For the year to the end of February, the group reported revenue of £2.93 billion, an increase of 13%, which was slightly below consensus forecasts, although adjusted pretax profits of £561 million were in line with market expectations. Premier Inn UK delivered record adjusted pre-tax profit of £588 million and a ROCE (return on capital employed) of 15.5%, while Germany continued to improve, reducing pre-tax losses from £50 million to £36 million and generating a 20% increase in revenue per available room in sterling terms. The group announced a further £150 million share buyback, to be completed in the first half of the current financial year, and a 26% increase in the interim dividend.  NEW GROWTH PLAN Much of the attention, however, was on the firm's 'accelerating growth plan' designed to maximise the returns from its estate. Having previously toyed with the idea of selling its Beefeater and Brewers' Fayre food and beverage outlets, the group now plans to offload 126 low-returning sites - having already negotiated the sale of 21 sites for £28 million - and to convert 112 restaurants into hotel rooms where it already has an integrated restaurant. This could 'unlock' 3,500 new room extensions and take Premier Inn to its target of 97,000 rooms by the end of 2029 while increasing margins. The plan will require around £500m of investment over the next four years, which will be funded through the firm's existing annual capital expenditure programme. There will be a one-off impact of £20 million to £25 million to this year's P&L (profit and loss) but the firm says this will be fully recovered in the 2026 financial year and deliver incremental adjusted pre-tax profit of £30 million to £40 million in 2027 rising to £80 million to £90 million in 2029. EXPERT VIEW Mamta Valechha, consumer discretionary analyst at Quilter Cheviot said: ‘Whitbread delivered full year results that were slightly behind on what the market expected. ‘Like its full-year results, current trading to the middle of April has been weak, like much of the industry has been experiencing. ‘The new plan will come at a cost, so profit expectations are being cut, although this should recover in a couple of years. This seems to make sense and be a lower-risk solution to tackling low-performing restaurants and opening new/higher-return rooms in a rather efficient manner.’ You can opt out at any time."},

The South Korean technology giant clocked a 10-fold surge in its first quarter profit, aided chiefly by a recovery in chip demand thanks to the rapidly growing AI industry. Operating profit rose to 6.6 trillion won (approximately $4.8 billion) in the three months to 31 March 2024, up from the 640 billion won seen a year ago. Q1 revenue rose to 71.9 trillion won from 63.75 trillion won a year ago, Samsung said in a press release. Stronger sales of its flagship Galaxy S24 smartphone line also factored into the increased revenue, as did a weaker South Korean won. The bumper results come as increasing AI development has sparked a rebound in chip demand in recent quarters. Samsung’s high-bandwidth memory chips are a key component of the processors used in running AI models. LOW BAR TO BEAT It is worth pointing out that Q1 results were in line with expectations put out by Samsung at the beginning of April. It is also worth saying that the seemingly exponential growth in profit was in part driven by a weak base for comparison from 2023, where the chipmaker was still grappling with weak global demand. The chipmaker said its second quarter will also ‘remain solid’ on demand from AI. The shares nudged about 1% higher in Far East trade to 77,500 won, but despite a modest rally since March, Samsung stock remains down nearly 3% year-to-date. Samsung had been reportedly targeted by activist investors earlier this year who have demanded that the company increase dividends and kick-off a programme of share buybacks as pressure mounts on South Korean companies to address low valuations.

The Phase III Destiny-Breast (DB06) trial was investigating the potential use of  Enhertu  in patients with second-line breast cancer who had progressed following hormone-based treatments.

The reinstatement of dividends signalled confidence from Card Factory and alongside a surge in full-year profits driven by a strong trading performance in its stores, made the market sit up and notice of the story. With a strengthened balance sheet marked by a 40% year-on-year drop in net debt to £34.4 million, Wakefield-headquartered   recommended a 4.5p dividend for the year to January 2024. CEO Darcy Willson-Rymer insisted that three years into his Opening our New Future Strategy, Card Factory is financially and operationally ‘a much stronger business. This means that we are able to both reinstate the dividend and invest in the future, while effectively navigating the ongoing economic environment.’ THE PRICES ARE RIGHT Card Factory is demonstrating there remains a place for a shop selling greetings cards and birthday balloons on British high streets if the prices it charges are right. Group revenue rose 10.3% to £510.9 million last year, which Card Factory said reflected ‘continued positive momentum across the business and effective execution of our strategy’. Adjusted pre-tax profits surged 27% higher to £62.1 million thanks to revenue growth and margin improvement amid adept management of inflationary pressures and the implementation of targeted price increases. Total store revenue ticked up 8.7% year-on-year, boosted by a net 26 new store openings during the period, which grew the UK & Ireland estate to a year-end 1,058 stores, while like-for-like sales were up 7.6%, driven by a strong store performance, with growth in card, gifts and celebration essentials, combined with positive traction online. And the retailer flagged ‘good progress’ on its partnership strategy with both new and existing retail partnerships, plus the acquisition of SA Greetings in South Africa, driving revenue growth of £12 million to £17 million. This included positive contributions from Card Factory’s new partnership with Liwa in the Middle East and from expansion of its partnership with Matalan in the UK. GOOD START TO FY25 Card Factory said trading since the start of the new financial year has been in line with the board’s expectations, with continued positive momentum across cards, gifts and celebration essentials for the spring seasons of Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day. There was no change to guidance, although Card Factory does expect pre-tax profit growth in full-year 2025 will be weighted toward the second half due to the phasing of planned investment and inflationary recovery actions. EXPERT VIEWS With a ‘buy’ rating on Card Factory and a 175p price target, Liberum Capital remains ‘very favourable on the outlook and Card Factory’s disruptive, value-focused market position where the new strategy remains on track to deliver exciting medium-term ambitions.’ Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, explained that Card Factory has been a beneficiary of ‘the woes of rival Clintons and the exit of Paperchase as a standalone entity, even if the latter serves a more premium market. ‘To its credit, Card Factory has carved out a value-focused niche for itself which is resonating with customers who are having to watch every penny. ‘The company does face headwinds like the impact on costs from the increase in the National Living Wage but it has demonstrated an ability to run the business with efficiency and this should stand it in good stead moving forward.’ DISCLAIMER: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in this article owns Shares magazine.

Net interest income dipped by $300 million or 3% to $8.7 billion due to ‘deposit migration’, where customers move their cash into higher interest-bearing accounts, while non-interest income increased by $900 million thanks to $1.3 billion of trading gains, mostly in the global banking and markets division. Operating costs of $8.2 billion were in line with estimates but provisions for bad loans were lower than forecast at $700 million, all of which fed through to pre-tax profits of $12.7 billion which were 5% ahead of expectations. The bank also   a $3 billion share buyback, 50% higher than analysts had forecast, along with a $0.21 per share special dividend. SURPRISE DEPARTURE There was one more surprise for investors, with the news chief executive Noel Quinn would be stepping down, which for a change hadn’t been telegraphed to the media. Quinn took charge in 2019 and steered the bank through an incredibly dramatic period, including the Covid pandemic and an attempt by Chinese insurer  Ping An (2318:HKG)  to break up the bank. A lifer who started at HSBC in 1987, Quinn had his pay doubled last year and wasn’t expected to step down but having been CEO there is no higher he can go and he is looking for a better work/life balance. Since he took over, the shares have gained 35% which is better than the 10% rise in the FTSE 100 but a long way behind the 95% gain in the Stoxx 600 European banking index.

Meidar is calling for O’Higgins to ‘exercise leadership’ and ‘unlock deep value in the stock’ by carrying out the following: confirm the details around Elementis’ cost-saving program; replace the current CEO and select recently appointed non-executive director Heejae Chae to lead the search process; conduct a strategic review of the portfolio with the aim of making it more attractive for a strategic buyer. In response to Gatemore's open letter the Elementis board said in a statement: ‘The board continues to believe that shareholder value is best driven by a focus on delivering the substantial actions that are currently being progressed at pace throughout the business and that underpin progress towards the 2026 targets of 19%+ operating margin, >90% cash conversion and >20% (return on capital) ROC, generated by $90 million of above market revenue growth and $30 million cost savings. ‘The board continues to engage with, and welcomes feedback from, all shareholders, with a clear focus on driving shareholder value, and looks forward to updating the market in its trading update alongside its (annual general meeting) AGM tomorrow.’ BID BY US PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM Back in February, shares in the specialty chemicals maker soared unexpectedly as it received  . New York based firm KPS Capital Partners submitted an offer of 160p per share, however the Elementis board rejected the offer which disappointed shareholder activists at the time. EXPERT VIEW Russ Mould investment director at AJ Bell said: ‘FTSE 250 chemicals group Elementis enjoyed a small bounce after major shareholder Gatemore Capital published an open letter criticising the company, saying it had ‘lost its direction’ and that it had been mis-managed. ‘Not one to mince its words, Gatemore has called for the CEO to be replaced and conduct a strategic review. Naming and shaming in this way are classic techniques by investors who are fed up with a company. ‘Typically, this tends to be a measure of last resort and it will be interesting to see if other investors rally together and put on more pressure to enforce change in the business.’ DISCLAIMER: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in this article owns Shares magazine.

While no financial details were disclosed, house broker Shore Capital believes Eagle Eye’s contract win with Britain’s biggest retailer, which includes the option to renew for a further year, ‘once again points to the commercial potential of the group’. WHAT DOES EAGLE EYE DO? For the uninitiated,   enables retail, travel and hospitality brands to earn the loyalty of customers by powering their real-time, omni-channel and personalised consumer marketing activities and is emerging as a vital technology partner to retailers. Eagle Eye’s loyalty and promotions omni-channel software-as-a-service platform called Eagle Eye AIR is clearly gaining traction with retail businesses, with customers including Asda, Tesco, Morrisons, Waitrose and John Lewis & Partners, not to mention  JD Sports Fashion  ( )  and Pret a Manger. The platform allows client customers to validate and redeem digital promotions in real-time, a key loyalty lever to pull in a budget-conscious climate. WHY THE TESCO TIE-UP EXCITES Eagle Eye has bagged a one-year contract with Tesco for its AI-powered Personalised Challenges solution, building on its existing relationship with Britain’s biggest retailer. Following a successful trial which saw a higher than anticipated participation rate, Tesco will roll out Personalised Challenges to more Clubcard members in the coming months, under the name Clubcard Challenges. The solution will power personalised and gamified offers and promotions to each individual Clubcard member. The Personalised Challenges solution, which became part of the Eagle Eye offering following the acquisition of Untie Nots, is a digital platform which allows retailers to personalise promotions, providing customised challenges designed to reward incremental behaviour. In-built AI and deep machine learning facilitate hyper-personalisation through its analytics capability, providing consumers with promotions more suited to them. Lizzie Reynolds, Tesco’s group membership and loyalty director, said: ‘We are constantly looking for ways to make Clubcard work harder for our customers. With Clubcard Prices on around 8,000 products, it is saving customers up to £360 off the annual cost of their groceries. Personalisation is about using what we know about customers to make their experience better and our rewards more helpful and we’re very excited to see how our customers respond to Clubcard Challenges.’ Eagle Eye chief executive Tim Mason commented: ‘It’s a privilege to be working with Tesco, one of the world’s great retailers and an acknowledged leader in customer loyalty, to usher in its next stage of personalised promotions. This win underlines the power of the EagleAI solution, capable of creating and delivering millions of hyper-personalised marketing messages, and our position at the forefront of personalised marketing.’ Results (19 March) for the half to 31 December 2023 demonstrated Eagle Eye’s continuing positive momentum as retailers move towards personalised marketing. The company delivered a 20% jump in sales to £24.1 million and a 50% surge in adjusted pre-tax profit to £2.6 million. EXPERT VIEWS Clive Black, Shore Capital’s consumer research guru, commented: ‘This is great news for Eagle Eye, with Tesco being the number one retailer in the UK and a leading player in Czechia, Hungary, Ireland and Slovakia. Indeed, Clubcard participation in group retail sales is now over 80%, with the highest involvement in Central Europe.’ Black continued: ‘Only a first step, but Tesco is a world leader in loyalty and data analytics through its dunnhumby subsidiary, so this is a great accreditation for Eagle Eye to me, noting that Tim Mason invented Clubcard, so a homecoming. Alongside the formidable client base Eagle Eye has assembled, this is another strong manifestation of the group’s capabilities and opportunities.’ Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said Eagle Eye has ‘started the week off with a bang, securing a new contract with Tesco for personalised promotions. ‘The grocery sector is highly competitive and the big names like Tesco have to do everything they can to lure in more customers and keep existing ones happy. Tesco has a reputation for leaning on its rich pool of data to give customers relevant offers and now it seems it is going to make them even more personalised.’ DISCLAIMER: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in this article owns Shares magazine.

The FTSE 100 index rose 40.94 points, 0.5%, at 8,180.77. It had climbed to 8,189.14, its best-ever level. ‘The blue-chip index continues to glow and sustain energy that we haven’t seen in the UK market for a long time,’ AJ Bell analyst Russ Mould commented. The FTSE 250 was up 87.10 points, 0.4%, at 19,911.26, and the AIM All-Share was up 4.13 points, 0.6%, at 759.41. The Cboe UK 100 was up 0.5% at 817.20, the Cboe UK 250 added 0.4% to 17,200.19, and the Cboe Small Companies was up 0.1% at 15,681.74. In European equities on Monday, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.1%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was flat. AJ Bell’s Mould added: ‘The FTSE 100’s year-to-date performance is now better than the Nasdaq 100 in the US, the S&P BSE 100 in India and the CSI 300 in China. So much for the FTSE’s reputation of being a home for boring, outdated companies.’ Among the star performers on London’s large-cap index on Monday, Frasers Group added 2.5% as the Sports Direct owner unveiled a £80.0 million share buyback. Asia-focused insurer Prudential rose 2.9% after a well-received update from life insurance and pensions company AIA Group in Hong Kong. Miner Anglo American added another 2.0% amid the growing conviction that it could receive another takeover bid. Reuters reported BHP is mulling an improved bid for BHP. Citing a source, the news agency reported a sweetened offer could be made ‘in coming weeks’. BHP last week Thursday confirmed it had offered to buy Anglo American in an all-share deal valuing the mining group at £31.1 billion. Anglo American rejected the offer. In New York, stocks are called to open higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is called up 0.1%, the S&P 500 up 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.3%. The Federal Reserve announces an interest rate decision on Wednesday. It is expected to leave rates unmoved, but with recent inflation readings coming in hot, and words from policymakers hawkish, focus will be on what Chair Jerome Powell has to say. Following the decision, focus then turns to the latest US jobs report on Friday. ING analysts commented: ‘Our economics team expects a 210,000 payroll print versus 250,000 consensus. We think the dollar is more likely to lose some ground because of payrolls than because of the Fed if anything.’ The pound was quoted at $1.2532 early Monday afternoon, up markedly from $1.2453 at the time of the London equities close on Friday. The euro stood at $1.0716, climbing from $1.0676. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥155.89, down sharply from JP¥157.41 on Friday. However, it had risen to another multi-decade high of JP¥160.14 earlier Monday. The ‘yen dumps before it jumps’, Bannockburn Global Forex analyst Marc Chandler summarised. Chandler added: ‘The dollar soared to almost JP¥160.20 before falling sharply to JP¥154.55 and then rebounding to almost JP¥156.00. Intervention has not been confirmed and Bank of Japan data will not cover it until next month. On balance, it appears that most think it was algo-trading in thin markets given the Japanese holiday.’ Back in London, Hipgnosis Songs Fund rose 1.0%. It backed a $1.57 billion takeover offer from Blackstone, trumping a previous offer from Concord Chorus Ltd, as the pursuit for the music rights publisher took another twist. New York-based investment manager Blackstone will pay $1.30 in cash for each share in Hipgnosis, around 104 pence. It is a premium of 4.0% to Concord’s $1.51 billion offer, worth around 101p per Hipgnosis share. Concord had raised its bid from $1.40 billion last Wednesday, in a bid to thwart reported interest from Blackstone. Hipgnosis said it no longer recommends that new Concord offer. Elsewhere, Smarttech247 Group added 11%. The artificial intelligence-enhanced cybersecurity services provider said it has won a new three-year deal with an existing client in the pharmaceutical solutions space. The deal, worth $2.1 million, will be for the provision of Smarttech247’s partnership offering with Splunk Chief Executive Officer said: ‘We are thrilled to announce this most recent contract win with a pre-existing client, a large, pharmaceuticals solutions organisation. This milestone underscores the confidence in Smarttech247 and Splunk’s combined capabilities and our dedication to delivering leading cybersecurity solutions.’ Eagle Eye Solutions rose 4.5%, after the marketing software-as-a-service firm won a one-year contract with Tesco. ‘EagleAI Personalised Challenges is a digital platform which allows retailers to personalise promotions, providing customised challenges designed to reward incremental behaviour.

A November cut is fully priced in, but the odds have fallen below 100% from time to time,’ analysts at Brown Brothers Harriman said. US inflation pressure was hotter than expected last month, according to the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge released Friday. The Bureau of Economic Analysis said the core personal consumption index gauge grew 2.8% in March, the annual pace of growth unmoved from February.

Anglo American rejected the offer. ‘Investors have clearly spent the weekend sitting down with a cuppa and reading the papers as all the column inches about potential counter bids for Anglo American have got people reaching for the ’buy’ button in their ISA or pension,’ said AJ Bell’s Russ Mould. Entain rose 2.1%, after it announced the repricing of two existing Term B loans, which it said will improve liquidity by about £295 million. The Isle of Man-based bookmaker, which owns Ladbrokes and Coral, said the changes applied to a USD term loan worth $1.74 billion, and a EUR term loan worth €1.03 billion.

The Isle of Man-based gambling software development company announced the expansion of its iPoker network into the Czech Republic, in partnership with Fortuna Entertainment Group. ‘This launch represents a significant milestone for both Playtech and Fortuna, as it introduces poker into the Fortuna Entertainment Group for the first time.

The internet search giant also announced it would pay its first ever dividend. Pre-market data has the shares surging 12% to $176, taking year to date gains to 25% and pushing the company’s market cap beyond $2 trillion. The business recorded its fastest top line growth in two years as revenue jumped 15% to $80.54 billion compared with consensus expectations of $78.59 billion according to Refinitiv data. The company beat Street estimates in both advertising and cloud revenue with the former making up around 80% of total revenue. Earnings per share came in at $1.89, smashing consensus forecasts of $1.51. In a statement CEO Sundar Pichai said: ‘Our results in the first quarter reflect strong performance from Search, YouTube and Cloud. ‘Our leadership in AI research and infrastructure, and our global product footprint, position us well for the next wave of AI innovation. Pichai believes the company has identified a clear path to monetise AI through advertising, cloud and subscriptions. DEBUT DIVIDEND Stocking investor excitement Alphabet announced its first dividend of $0.2 per share and an additional $70 billion stock repurchase programme. The company closed the quarter with cash and equivalents of $108 billion compared with $110.9 billion a year ago. Investment director Russ Mould at AJ Bell commented: ‘Alphabet joining the ranks of tech companies paying dividends is a sign of the times. ‘Big tech firms have enjoyed stellar growth over the past decade and while most remain highly innovative, their cash flows have become so strong that there’s oodles of money left over post-reinvestment in the business to reward shareholders. ‘It’s not that they’ve been tight on cash before, it’s just that previously share buybacks were seen as the preferred way to deploy surplus money. ‘The yields on offer from Alphabet and Meta are minuscule but the pace of dividend growth could be the key attraction for income hunters.’ Disclaimer: Financial services company AJ Bell referenced in the article owns Shares magazine.

STRONG PROPERTY PREMIUMS Insurance written premiums for the three months to the end of March increased by 7% to $1.48 billion driven by a substantial increase in property risks which offset lower premiums in the cyber division. Property premiums jumped 26% year-on-year from $357 million to $451 million helped by higher rates and what the firm described as ‘exciting opportunities’ as the business moves into the Excess & Surplus market, where specialty risks are underwritten. Specialty risk premiums rose a more modest 6% to $455 million, while MAP (marine, aviation and political) premiums were flat at $261 million and cyber premiums declined 10% against a strong year-ago quarter to $253 million. First-quarter claims were as expected with natural catastrophe activity within the margins the firm holds in reserve for such events.

Trade was more cautious in mainland Europe, however, ahead of key eurozone data later. The FTSE 100 index rose 26.28 points, 0.3%, at 8,173.31. The FTSE 250 was up 51.07 points, 0.3%, at 20,135.86, and the AIM All-Share was up 1.36 points, 0.2%, at 764.69.

Commerzbank analyst Ulrich Leuchtmann commented: ‘Not long ago, it seemed that the Fed would soon be able to declare ’mission accomplished’ in the fight against inflation. That is no longer the case. At the time of the last FOMC meeting in March, it was far from clear. That is the relevant piece of news that emerged in the inter-meeting period. And tomorrow, it’s all about how the FOMC statement reacts to it. Because that communication will determine whether the revisions to the Fed’s expectations since then have been too much, too little, or just right. Therein lies the importance of tomorrow’s statement and tomorrow’s press conference.’ The pound was quoted at $1.2537 early Tuesday, down from $1.2554 late Monday. The euro stood at $1.0705, falling from $1.0717. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥156.90, up from JP¥156.64. The dollar-yen pair moved wildly on Monday, peaking at JP¥160.16, but falling as low as JP¥154.54 at one point, prompting speculation about a currency intervention. ING analysts commented: ‘Japan has likely intervened in the FX market, but this has not yet been made official and intervention figures for yesterday should only be published at the end of May. More support to the yen may well be needed as markets still have reasons to push USD/JPY higher.’ The economic calendar for Tuesday has a eurozone gross domestic product reading, as well as consumer price inflation data, at 1000 BST. In London, HSBC rose 2.5%, the best FTSE 100 performer. The London-based, Asia-focused lender said first-quarter net interest income fell 3.4% to $8.65 billion from $8.96 billion year-on-year, though came in higher than company-compiled consensus of $8.50 billion. Net operating income increased 1.5% to $20.03 billion from $19.74 billion. Pretax profit was $12.65 billion, 1.8% lower than the prior year’s $12.89 billion, but ahead of $12.61 billion consensus. HSBC noted the figure included a $4.8 billion gain following the disposal of its Canadian banking business, which was partially offset by a $1.1 billion impairment related to the sale of its business in Argentina. HSBC said it has approved a first interim dividend of $0.10 per share, up year-on-year from $0.09. It will also pay a special dividend of $0.21 following the sale of its Canadian banking business. In addition, it announced a new share buyback of up to $3 billion, following the conclusion of the $2 billion buyback announced with its full-year results. ‘I’m pleased with our start to 2024. We completed the sale of our Canada business and agreed the sale of our Argentina business, both of which allow us to focus on markets with higher value international opportunities. Our good profit performance...in the first quarter has enabled us to continue the trend of rewarding our shareholders,’ said Chief Executive Noel Quinn. HSBC said Quinn has informed the board of his intention to retire from the bank after nearly five years leading the company, and 37 years at the firm in total. Quinn said he plans to ‘pursue a portfolio career’ going forward. Asia-focused insurer Prudential fell 4.6%, the worst large-cap performer. First quarter new business profit, excluding economic impacts, rose 11% at constant exchange rates to $810 million, compared to $727 million a year prior. But, after allowing for economic impacts, new business profit was broadly unchanged at $726 million. At actual exchange rates, and factoring in the ‘economic impacts’, new business profit fell 2.3%. First quarter annual premium equivalent sales increased 4.2% to $1.63 billion from $1.56 billion a year prior, despite strong comparatives in Hong Kong and headwinds in Vietnam. At constant currency, it grew 7.3%. Chief Executive Anil Wadhwani said he was ‘pleased’ with the results. ‘Our continued focus on the quality of business written is reflected in new business profit (excluding economic impacts) growing more than APE sales. Our total APE sales have grown sequentially each quarter since [the third quarter of 2023], reflecting resilient consumer demand across Asia and demonstrating the strength of our multi-market and multi-channel distribution model,’ the CEO said. There was no share buyback, but Wadhwani said Prudential would provide an update on its capital management plans by its half-year results. Hargreaves Lansdown shot up 6.9%. It reported assets under administration spiked to a record high in its recently-ended third-quarter, and it said ‘momentum’ has continued this month. The wealth management platform reported net new business of £1.6 billion for the three months ended March 31. It noted ‘good momentum into tax year end with increased gross inflows, net new clients and share dealing volumes’. Assets under administration rose 5.3% on-quarter to £149.7 billion, a record, from £142.2 billion. Hargreaves Lansdown noted the net new business outcome was a ‘significant step up versus the first half of the year’. It posted net client growth of 34,000 in the quarter, picking up speed from 23,000 a year prior. Share dealing volumes averaged 794,000 per month, rising on-year from 770,000. Total revenue in the quarter was 6.2% higher year-on-year at £199.7 million from £188.1 million. It added: ‘Looking ahead to the remainder of the financial year, we are pleased to see momentum continue into April as clients take advantage of the benefits of investing at the start of the tax year. We continue to make good progress against our priorities for the year - improving our client proposition, controlling our costs and increasing our execution pace so that we can capitalise on the significant growth opportunities that lie ahead and create value for all our stakeholders.’ Elsewhere in London, Card Factory rose 7.6%.

The FTSE 100 index rose 40.03 points, 0.5%, at 8,179.86. It had climbed to 8,185.59 shortly after the opening bell, its best-ever level. The FTSE 250 was up 42.62 points, 0.2%, at 19,866.78, and the AIM All-Share was up 2.45 points, 0.3%, at 757.73. The Cboe UK 100 was up 0.4% at 816.86, the Cboe UK 250 added 0.2% to 17,160.06, and the Cboe Small Companies was up 0.1% at 15,642.45. In European equities on Monday, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.3%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was up 0.2%. In China, the Shanghai Composite ended up 0.8%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong traded 0.5% higher in late dealings. The S&P/ASX 200 in Sydney rose 0.8%. Financial markets in Tokyo were closed for the Showa Day public holiday. In New York on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.4%, the S&P 500 up 1.0% and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.0%. ‘The S&P500 record its best performance since October 2023. Yes, the S&P500 gained nearly 3% last week, while Nasdaq 100 gained more than that, as last week’s sour combo of slowing US growth but rising inflation was offset by the better-than-expected earnings from Microsoft and Google, and a surprise jump in Tesla shares despite earnings miss,’ Swissquote analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya commented. ‘Zooming out, Friday’s higher-than-expected core PCE print didn’t weigh much on investor sentiment, as most of the price action due to the inflation disappointment happened after Thursday’s GDP report.’ The Federal Reserve announces an interest rate decision on Wednesday. It is expected to leave rates unmoved, but with recent inflation readings coming in hot, and words from policymakers hawkish, focus will be on what Chair Powell has to say. The pound was quoted at $1.2532 early Monday, up markedly from $1.2453 at the time of the London equities close on Friday. The euro stood at $1.0724, climbing from $1.0676. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥154.89, down sharply from JP¥157.41 on Friday, but after rising to another multi-decade high of JP¥160.14 earlier Monday. ING analysts commented: ‘While not yet official, there are strong indications that Japan intervened in the FX market this morning after USD/JPY touched 160.0. If we follow the same script as 22 September 2022, USD/JPY should remain volatile throughout the session before stabilising around 156-157.’ In London, Prudential rose 2.8%, among the best FTSE 100 performers. It rose in a positive read across after Hong Kong-based life insurance and pensions company AIA Group upped its share buyback programme to $12.0 billion from $10.0 billion, and reported a double-digit percentage rise in new business and annualised new premiums in the first quarter of 2024. AIA shares traded 6.1% higher in late dealings in Hong Kong. Still getting a boost from M&A and lofty commodity prices, miner Anglo American added 1.7%. Shares had jumped over 20% last week, supported by news that larger peer BHP has sized up a bid. Anglo American was the star performer last week on a FTSE 100 that is finding favour again. The FTSE 100 climbed over 3% last week and is up just under 6% since the end of 2023. Hipgnosis Songs Fund added 2.3% to 106.20 pence. It backed a $1.57 billion takeover offer from Blackstone, trumping a previous offer from Concord. Blackstone will pay $1.30 in cash for each share in the music investment company, around 104 pence. It is a premium of 4.0% to Concord’s $1.51 billion offer. Concord had raised its bid from $1.40 billion last week, in a bid to thwart Blackstone. HSF no longer recommends that new Concord offer. Concord sweetened its bid after HSF earlier in April noted Blackstone was mulling a $1.50 billion offer. Hipgnosis Chair Robert Naylor said: ‘Since we started our strategic review, we have been clearly focused on looking at all the options to deliver shareholder value. We are delighted that, following competitive interests in acquiring Hipgnosis, our investors now have a chance to immediately realise their holding at an increased premium.’ Elementis rose 1.8% after a shareholder called on the chemicals company to make itself ‘more attractive for a strategic buyer’. Gatemore Capital Management called on Elementis to ‘accelerate and confirm the details’ on cost-savings, replace its current chief executive and conduct a strategic review. Elsewhere in London, fire safety and heat management product developer Zenova jumped 25%. It received a £2.4 million order for its FP fire protection coating from sprayer group Drips & Sparks. The offering will be used on steel surfaces at Gracewood Construction project sites in the UK. Brent oil was quoted at $87.40 a barrel early Monday, down from $88.26 late Friday. Gold was quoted at $2,337.01 an ounce, up from the $2,333.37 it bought at the time of the London equities close Friday. Monday’s economic calendar has a German inflation reading at 1300 BST.

The FTSE 100 index added 60.97 points, 0.8%, at 8,139.83. It is its best closing level ever, and it earlier hit a record intraday high of 8,146.75. The FTSE 250 was up 222.18 points, 1.1%, at 19,824.16, and the AIM All-Share rose 2.16 points, 0.3%, at 755.28. For the week, the FTSE 100 added 3.1%, the FTSE 250 rose 2.2% and the AIM climbed 1.3%. The Cboe UK 100 rose 0.9% to 813.49, the Cboe UK 250 added 1.1% to 17,127.78, and the Cboe Small Companies rose 1.4% to 15,661.70. In European equities on Friday, the CAC 40 in Paris rose 0.9%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt surged 1.4%. In New York on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2% higher, the S&P 500 was up 1.0%, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.0%, aided by strong well-received tech earnings overnight. The pound was quoted at $1.2453 late on Friday afternoon in London, lower compared to $1.2490 at the equities close on Thursday. The euro stood at $1.0676, down against $1.0713. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JP¥157.41, markedly higher compared to JP¥155.52, as the Japanese currency sunk after a Bank of Japan left rates unmoved. US inflation pressure was hotter than expected last month, according to the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge released Friday. The Bureau of Economic Analysis said the core personal consumption index gauge grew 2.8% in March, the annual pace of growth unmoved from February. In February, it had cooled slightly from 2.9% in January. The latest reading topped the FXStreet cited consensus of 2.6%. The core PCE reading does not include food and energy. The annual headline PCE figure, which does, hotted up to 2.7% in March, from 2.5% in February, and topping the consensus of 2.6%. Analysts at ING said the data was ‘not as bad as feared, but still too hot’. ‘Quarterly inflation data surprised to the upside and led the market to brace for a very unpleasant MoM print today. Thankfully it was due to upward revisions, primarily to January, with the March figure coming in line with initial expectations. Nonetheless, inflation remains too hot and September remains the earliest opportunity for an interest rate cut,’ ING added. In London, NatWest shares climbed 6.1%. The Edinburgh-based lender said operating profit fell 27% to £1.33 billion in the first three months of 2024 from £1.81 billion a year before, but it highlighted ‘improving’ confidence amongst customers. This profit decrease reflected a 10% drop in total income to £3.48 billion from £3.88 billion. Within this, net interest income decreased 8.6% to £2.65 billion from £2.90 billion. Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital noted the operating profit figure beat consensus expectations by around 5% reflecting positive variances on net interest income, impairment and litigation and conduct charges that were partly offset by negative variances on non-interest income and costs. Anglo American rose 3.3% as it rejected an ‘opportunistic’ takeover tilt from larger peer BHP. BHP on Thursday confirmed it had offered to buy Anglo American in an all-share deal valuing the mining group at £31.1 billion. In a formal response, Anglo American on Friday said its board had considered the BHP proposal with its advisers and concluded that the offer ‘significantly undervalues’ the company and its future prospects. ‘In addition, the proposal contemplates a structure which the board believes is highly unattractive for Anglo American’s shareholders, given the uncertainty and complexity inherent in the proposal, and significant execution risks,’ Anglo American said. BHP fell 2.6%. Elsewhere in the M&A space, Darktrace jumped 16%, after it agreed to be taken over by Thoma Bravo. Darktrace said it has agreed to an all-cash takeover offer worth $5.32 billion from funds managed by private equity firm Thoma Bravo. Chicago-based Thoma Bravo, which focuses on software investments, offers $7.75 in cash per Darktrace share. Record shares rose 1.9% after it reported an increase in assets under management in the financial year just finished but said the pace of net inflows slowed. The Windsor, England-based currency and derivatives manager said in the 12 months ended March 31 assets under management equivalent increased 17% to $102.2 billion from $87.7 billion the year before. Net inflows were $6.8 billion for the year, down 25% from $9.1 billion before. Performance fees of £5.8 million were unchanged. Chief Executive Jan Witte said: ‘I am excited to take over the reins as CEO at a time when the group’s AUME has reached new heights and the outlook for our business remains strong.’ Witte pointed out AUME had breached the $100 million mark for the first time in its 40-plus year history.

Investors responded positively, sending the shares up 10p or 3.5% to the top of the FTSE 100 leader board and a new 12-month high. SMALL BEAT The bank reported first-quarter net interest income of £2.65 billion, which was slightly ahead of market expectations although it represented a 9% fall on the previous year even though the net interest margin actually increased marginally. Like its rivals, NatWest is seeing a decrease in loan income and an increase in deposit costs as savers switch their money into interest-bearing accounts. Non-interest income fell 15% to £824 million, which was below estimates, but lower loan loss provisions of £93 million against £186 million last year helped the bank report adjusted pre-tax profits of £1.27 billion, down 27% on last year but slightly ahead of market forecasts. Newly-confirmed chief executive Paul Thwaite   NatWest had posted ‘a strong set of results’ and observed that ‘though macro-uncertainty continues, customer confidence and activity is improving’. Thwaite also referenced the government’s latest sale of NatWest shares and said returning the group to private ownership later this year was ‘a shared ambition’. EXPERT VIEWS Jefferies banking expert Joseph Dickerson described the results as ‘roughly ticking the boxes’ excluding the miss at the non-interest income level but suggested there was nothing in the report to prompt an earnings upgrade for the full year. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould commented: ‘While NatWest is affected by the same headwinds as other banks – greater competition on mortgages and customers moving their money into accounts offering higher rates of interest – its first quarter numbers still came in ahead of expectations and there are signs these headwinds are starting to ease. ‘This beat hasn’t been backed up by an increase in full-year guidance but a conservative approach provides scope for NatWest to deliver a positive surprise down the road’, added Mould.
