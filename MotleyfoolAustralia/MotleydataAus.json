That's because listed below are three ASX shares that have been named as buys and tipped to rise 30% to 60%. Here's what analysts are saying about them: Arcadium Lithium  ( ASX: LTM ) Analysts at Bell Potter think that this miner would be a great way to gain exposure to the  lithium  industry before it rebounds. The broker currently has a buy rating and $9.50 price target on its shares. This implies potential upside of 32% for investors from current levels. It commented:   LTM provides the largest, most diversified exposure to lithium in terms of mode of upstream production, asset locations, downstream processing and customer markets. It is a key large-cap leverage to lithium prices and sentiment, which we expect to improve over the medium term. In supportive markets, LTM's growth pipeline could see the company more than double production over the next three years.   Flight Centre Travel Group Ltd  ( ASX: FLT ) Morgans is feeling very bullish about this travel agent giant. So much so, the broker has it on its best ideas list again this month. Its analysts have an add rating and $27.27 price target on the company's shares. This implies potential upside of almost 34% for investors over the next 12 months. It commented:   FLT has the greatest risk, reward profile of our travel stocks under coverage. The risk is centred around execution given its changed business model, while the reward is material if FLT delivers on its 2% margin target. If achieved, this would result in material upside to consensus estimates and valuations. FLT is targeting to achieve this margin in FY25. With greater confidence in the travel recovery and the benefits of Flight Centre's transformed business model already emerging, we think the company is well placed over coming years.   Tyro Payments Ltd  ( ASX: TYR ) Analysts at Morgans are also feeling very positive about this payments company and sees significant value in its shares at current levels. Particularly given its belief that its performance will rebound this year. The broker has an add rating and $1.50 price target on its shares, which suggests potential upside of over 60% for investors. It said:   TYR sold off heavily in 2023 affected by the broad pull back in technology stocks and overall concerns regarding its earnings trajectory. However, we believe FY24 will show significantly improved business momentum, importantly driven by a much greater focus on lifting overall profitability. TYR still trades at a significant discount to valuation."},

To narrow things down, I have picked out four ASX dividend shares that brokers are bullish on right now. Here's what sort of yields they are forecasting from them: Aurizon Holdings Ltd ( ASX: AZJ ) The first ASX dividend share that could be a buy is Australia's largest rail freight operator, Aurizon. The team at Ord Minnett is bullish on the company and has an accumulate rating and $4.70 price target on its shares. As for dividends, its analysts are forecasting partially franked dividends of 17.8 cents per share in FY 2024 and then 24.3 cents per share in FY 2025. Based on the latest Aurizon share price of $3.81, this will mean  dividend yields  of 4.7% and 6.4%, respectively. BHP Group Ltd  ( ASX: BHP ) Mining giant BHP could be another ASX dividend share to buy according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. The broker thinks its shares are good value at current levels and is expecting some attractive yields in the near term. It is forecasting fully franked dividends of US$1.42 (A$2.14) per share in FY 2024 and then US$1.26 (A$1.90) per share in FY 2025. Based on the current BHP share price of $42.91, this equates to dividend yields of 5% and 4.4%, respectively. Goldman currently has a buy rating and $49.00 price target on the miner's shares. HomeCo Daily Needs REIT ( ASX: HDN ) Another ASX dividend share that could be a buy is HomeCo Daily Needs. It is a neighbourhood retail and large format retail focused property company. Morgans likes the company. This is due to its resilient cashflows and its belief that HomeCo Daily Needs will be a beneficiary of accelerating click and collect trends. In respect to income, Morgans expects dividends per share of 8 cents in FY 2024 and then 9 cents in FY 2025. Based on the current HomeCo Daily Needs share price of $1.25, this will mean yields of 6.4% and 7.2%, respectively. The broker has an add rating and $1.37 price target on the IPH Ltd  ( ASX: IPH ) A final ASX dividend share that could be a buy is IPH. It is an intellectual property solutions company with operations across the world. Goldman Sachs thinks its shares are good value at current levels, particularly given the company's defensive qualities and organic growth potential. The broker expects this to support the payment of fully franked dividends per share of 34 cents in FY 2024 and 37 cents in FY 2025. Based on the current IPH share price of $5.82, this represents yields of 5.8% and 6.35%, respectively. Goldman has a buy rating and $8.70 price target on its shares."},

The survey showed that 40% of Baby Boomers and 29% of Gen X rated superannuation as their no. 1 investment option.  Property also scored highly, with 37% of Boomers and 28% of Gen Xers rating it their preferred investment asset class.  Varying approaches to retirement savings  While both age cohorts valued superannuation highly, Findex investment relations head Matthew Swieconek said they typically took different approaches to growing their  retirement  savings. Swieconek said Baby Boomers often had a more passive approach.  Having benefited from a strong jobs market and the longest access to compulsory superannuation contributions, they \"may prioritise capital preservation and income generation in their investment choices\", Swieconek said. Generation X   might feel less confident about their retirement security whilst juggling higher living costs, stagnant long-term wages growth and large mortgage repayments due to higher  interest rates .  \"They may be more risk-averse and seek a balance between growth and stability in their super investments,\" he said. Let's talk superannuation The Baby Boomers were  born  between 1946 and 1965, and Gen X was born between 1966 and 1980.  Superannuation was  introduced in Australia  in 1992. Most superannuation funds are primarily invested in ASX shares and international equities.  Younger Australians may choose to invest in more aggressive 'growth' super funds to maximise their earnings. With a longer runway to retirement, they can tolerate  higher risk for higher rewards .  In 2023,  Chant West figures  showed the standard growth superannuation fund (61% to 80% growth assets like ASX shares), returned a median 9.9%. 'High growth' funds (81% to 95% growth assets) returned 11.4%. Baby Boomers may switch from growth to 'balanced' or 'conservative' funds to preserve more of their capital. According to Chant West, the standard 'balanced' superannuation fund (41% to 60% growth assets) returned 8.1% in 2023, and conservative funds returned 6.2%. Key actions to ensure a secure retirement  Findex recommends the following key investment actions for Baby Boomers and Gen X Australians to take now to ensure  an excellent retirement  down the track.  Baby Boomers   Findex recommends the following five actions for Baby Boomers to retire well:    Pre-retirement super boost : Maximize your superannuation balance before retirement by utilising catch-up contributions and considering strategies like  downsizing contributions .     Legislative changes:  Stay informed about changes in superannuation and retirement income policy to adjust your strategy accordingly.     Retirement income planning:  Engage with a financial advisor to develop a sustainable retirement income strategy, considering the transition to retirement pensions or annuities.    Prepare the next generation:  Consider introducing your kids to a trusted financial advisor to help make financial advice more affordable and accessible for them.   Legacy planning:  Focus on estate planning and how your superannuation benefits will be managed and distributed.     Gen X  Findex recommends the following actions for Gen Xers to retire well:    Maximising superannuation contributions : Enhancing both concessional and non-concessional super contributions can be a great way to build retirement savings toward the peak earning years.     Review your super investments:  Seek advice to refine your superannuation strategy, focusing on investment selection within super, tax planning, and retirement income streams.     Healthcare and insurance:  Review your insurance needs within superannuation to ensure adequate coverage, as health concerns may become more prominent.     Consider borrowing to invest:  Known as gearing, borrowing money to invest can help boost your portfolio. However, due to its high-risk nature, talk to a financial advisor to ensure this is right for you.   Estate planning:  Start planning for your wealth transfer to ensure your super and other assets are distributed according to your wishes."},
{"source_name": "The Motley Fool", "title": "1 compelling ASX dividend share I'd buy for its big yield", "title_link": "https://www.fool.com.au/2024/05/11/1-compelling-asx-dividend-share-id-buy-for-its-big-yield/", "published_date": "May 11, 2024", "publisher_name": "Tristan Harrison", "Description": "ASX dividend shares  can be really appealing to investors looking for  cash flow  via  passive income . There are plenty of stocks with a high  dividend yield , but I'm going to write about one particular name in this article:  APA Group  ( ASX: APA ). The business is not exactly a household name. It has a huge gas pipeline across the country which transports half of the country's usage. APA owns gas storage, processing and gas-powered energy generation facilities. The business also owns electricity transmission, solar and wind assets. There are a few compelling reasons why the ASX dividend share could be a compelling high-yield investment. Appealing dividend yield and track record The APA share price has declined by 16% in the last year, as we can see on the chart below. APA already had a solid dividend yield before the drop and it has been boosted by having a cheaper valuation. For example, if a business has a 6% dividend yield and then the share price falls 10%, the yield becomes 6.6%. The energy infrastructure giant has guided its distribution is expected to be 56 cents per security in FY24, which translates into a dividend yield of 6.4%. APA has grown its distribution every year for the past 20 years, which is one of the best consecutive payout growth streaks on the ASX. The estimate on Commsec suggests the business could grow its distribution to 57.5 cents per security in FY25, which would be a distribution yield of 6.6%. Investing for growth The ASX dividend share is benefiting from the fact that it has stable and growing revenue. Over 90% of its revenue is linked to  inflation , which has obviously been elevated in recent years. But it's not just sitting there with its existing assets. The distributions to investors are paid from cash flow, which is steadily growing as more of its projects are finished and become operational. It has a  distribution payout target  of 60% to 70% of free cash flow. In the recent  Macquarie Australia Conference , the business said it had a \"strong pipeline\" of growth opportunities between FY24 to FY26, totalling more than $1.8 billion. Increasing energy demands I'm not exactly sure how Australia's energy situation is going to evolve in the coming decades, but Labor recently said that  gas will be part of the picture  in 2050 and potentially beyond. As a major pipeline owner, the ASX dividend share has an important role in the future of gas in the country. But it's investing in other areas too, including a growing portfolio of renewable energy generation and electricity transmission assets. APA is also investigating the potential for pipelines to carry hydrogen, though that's not a core part of the thesis for me. Australia's energy demands  are growing , with data centres expected to be a major contributor to that. This could be another help for overall energy demand.  I'm not expecting explosive growth for APA, but the business could continue to play an important part in Australia's energy mix, enabling ongoing shareholder payouts."},

After all, you have toiled all your working life to earn this money, and hopefully, it will afford you a happy, financially secure, and stress-free  retirement . Likewise, your super investment is not something you should constantly meddle with. This means you'll want the ASX shares within it to be high-quality companies you can hold for the long term — not risky stocks you need to dip in and out of regularly. Whether you run your own  self-managed super fund (SMSF)  or simply like to add a few personal touches to your retail super fund, read on! Because we asked our Foolish contributors which ASX shares they reckon deserve a place in your superannuation fund in May. Here is what the team came up with: 6 best ASX shares for your super fund right now (smallest to largest)   VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF  ( ASX: MOAT ), $891.95 million   Collins Foods Ltd  ( ASX: CKF ) $1.10 billion   iShares S&P 500 ETF  ( ASX: IVV ), $7.74 billion   Medibank Private Ltd  ( ASX: MPL ), $10.05 billion   Coles Group Ltd  ( ASX: COL ), $21.75 billion   Westpac Banking Corp  ( ASX: WBC ), $92.60 billion   ( Market capitalisations  as of market close 10 May 2024). Why our Foolish writers rate these ASX stocks as super!  VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF What it does : This ASX  exchange-traded fund (ETF)  gives investors exposure to a  diversified  portfolio of attractively priced US companies with sustainable competitive advantages. By  James Mickleboro : There are few better investors to follow in the footsteps of than Warren Buffett. Since the 1960s, the Oracle of Omaha has consistently beaten the market and delivered outsized returns for his  Berkshire Hathaway  business. The remarkable thing is that Buffett hasn't achieved his success by using complex investment strategies. His approach is about as simplistic as it gets on the stock market, and time and time again, he has beaten the market. Buffett does this by buying high-quality companies with sustainable competitive advantage at fair prices. The VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF replicates this strategy, making it super easy for investors to invest in companies that Buffett would buy without having to do any research.  Over the past decade, the index this ETF tracks has generated an average total return of 16% per annum, significantly better than the long-term market average of 10% per annum. Motley Fool contributor James Mickleboro does not own units of the VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF. Collins Foods Ltd What it does:  Collins Foods is a major franchisee of KFC outlets in Australia and owns a growing network of KFCs in Germany and the Netherlands. The company is also responsible for the Taco Bell chain in Australia. By  Tristan Harrison :   I've long admired the simple  growth potential  of this ASX 200 company and recently bought shares. I decided to take advantage of the more than 20% decline in the Collins Foods share price since January.  What's simple about the growth? The company just needs to keep opening/acquiring new locations to grow its scale.  The HY24 result showed everything I think Collins is capable of continuing into the future. Revenue rose 14.3%, underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased 16.7%, and underlying  net profit  went up 28.7%. Seeing the profit levels rise (noticeably) faster than revenue is a good sign for future profit scaling of the business. KFC Australia saw a same-store sales (SSS) growth of 6.6% in HY24, while KFC Europe's SSS growth was 8.8%. That's a solid organic growth rate without taking into account any new stores. Collins Foods opened four new KFC locations in Australia in HY24 and eight in the Netherlands. I think Europe's large population gives the company a long growth runway. In terms of the  dividend , the annual payout has increased every year over the past decade. The current grossed-up  dividend yield  is around 4.25%. Motley Fool contributor Tristan Harrison owns shares of Collins Foods Ltd.  iShares S&P 500 ETF What it does:  The IVV ETF is a low-cost, index-based ASX ETF that tracks the performance of the 500 largest United States companies comprising the  S&P 500 Index  (SP: .INX). By  Bronwyn Allen :  I like the kind of stocks you can buy and hold forever for my superannuation fund. My super is a long-term savings vehicle for my retirement, so I want it full of boring yet reliable long-term  growth stocks .  And it helps that the world's most successful investor, Warren Buffett, has long recommended that no-fuss investors like me avoid individual stock picking and just consistently throw money into low-cost S&P 500 index funds instead.  He says: \"Just keep buying. American business is going to do fine over time, so you know the investment universe is going to do very well.\" Buying the IVV ETF means owning a slice of mega global companies like  Microsoft ,  Apple ,  Nvidia ,  Amazon ,  Alphabet , and  Meta Platforms .  The IVV ETF is also one of  the 10 cheapest ETFs on the ASX  with a management expense ratio (MER) of 0.04%, so it fits Buffett's brief very well.  The iShares S&P 500 ETF share price is currently $52.61, up 29% over the past 12 months and it's 91% higher over five years. Motley Fool contributor Bronwyn Allen does not own units on the iShares S&P 500 ETF.  Medibank Private Ltd What it does:  Medibank Private is Australia's largest private health  insurance provider  in the country. More than 4 million people entrust their health coverage to Medibank or its more affordable Ahm label. By  Mitchell Lawler :  Health insurance is an industry where size matters. The more members an insurer has, the greater its bargaining power to secure better arrangements with hospitals and other health-based organisations. It's a flywheel effect: More members lead to better prices, which in turn generates more members. Once that flywheel is spinning, competitors can struggle to keep pace. Importantly, Medibank Private is a business that I see being as relevant in 30 years as it is today. That's critical when it comes to holding  compounding  investments inside a superannuation fund. The last thing anyone wants is a chunk of their retirement being vaporised in a business that goes bust. In my opinion, the odds of that happening to Medibank are minuscule. Motley Fool contributor Mitchell Lawler does not own shares of Medibank Private Ltd. Coles Group Ltd   What it does:  Coles is the second-largest supermarket operator in Australia, with a huge network of stores around the country. Coles also owns the bottle shop chains Liquorland, Vintage Cellars, and First Choice. By  Sebastian Bowen : The qualities investors typically look for in shares to include in a superannuation fund are stability, certainty, and a reliable dividend. Coles arguably offers all three in spades. Coles is a  consumer staples  stock, meaning it sells goods we all  need , rather than necessarily  want .  It's hard to imagine a future where a decent chunk of the Australian population doesn't visit Coles to buy food and drinks or stock up on household essentials. As long as there is a local Coles offering these goods at a relatively low cost, Australians will visit it on a regular basis. This makes Coles' earnings base highly  defensive , which should help anyone with this company in a super fund sleep well at night. Coles has also built up a very strong dividend track record since it was listed on the ASX back in late 2018. The company has yet to deliver a dividend cut and has increased its annual dividends every year since its ASX debut. At recent pricing, investors can grab Coles shares with a fully  franked  dividend yield of more than 4%. Motley Fool contributor Sebastian Bowen does not own shares of Coles Group Ltd. Westpac Banking Corp   What it does:  Established in 1817 as the Bank of New South Wales, Westpac provides a range of consumer, business, and institutional  banking  and wealth management services. It has operations throughout Australia, New Zealand, and the near Pacific region. By  Bernd Struben : I think Westpac shares deserve a place in most every superannuation portfolio. The big four bank recently completed all 354 activities of its risk transformation plan, improving its risk governance. Westpac today is a simpler and stronger business than it was in recent years. And I was pleasantly surprised by Westpac's first-half  results . Despite an  inflation -exacerbated 8% increase in half-year operating expenses to $5.40 billion, Westpac's $3.51 billion net profit, excluding notable items, was down only 1% year-on-year. And with Australia's economic growth forecast to rebound to 2.5% in 2025, the bank looks well placed to increase those profits. Atop announcing a share-price-boosting additional $1 billion worth of on-market  share buybacks , management also declared an interim dividend of 90 cents per share. Westpac shares now trade on a fully franked trailing yield of 5.5%. The Westpac share price is up 26% in 12 months. Motley Fool contributor Bernd Struben does not own shares of Westpac Banking Corp."},
{"source_name": "The Motley Fool", "title": "Here's the Westpac dividend forecast through to 2027", "title_link": "https://www.fool.com.au/2024/05/11/heres-the-westpac-dividend-forecast-through-to-2027/", "published_date": "May 11, 2024", "publisher_name": "James Mickleboro", "Description": "Westpac Banking Corp  ( ASX: WBC ) shares were in the spotlight last week when Australia's oldest bank released its eagerly anticipated  half year results . For the six months ended 31 March, Westpac reported a net profit before one-offs came in at $3,506 million. This is an 8% decline on the prior corresponding period but a far more modest 1% reduction on the second half of FY 2023. Despite the softer profits, the Westpac board decided to reward its shareholders with a  dividend  increase. The bank declared a fully franked interim dividend of 75 cents per share, which is a 7.1% increase on the prior corresponding period. But the Westpac board didn't stop there. Thanks to its strong balance sheet, it added a surprise 15 cents per share special dividend into the mix, as well as an additional $1 billion on-market share buyback. Unfortunately for income investors, Westpac's shares have now traded ex-dividend for both its interim dividend and special dividend. This means it is too late to receive these payouts unless you were a shareholder before the ex-dividend date. But don't worry, there are more dividends on the way. But how big will they be? Let's take a look at what analysts are forecasting for the Westpac dividend following this result. Westpac dividend forecast According to a note out of Goldman Sachs, its analysts have lifted their Westpac dividend estimates in response to its half year results. The note reveals that Goldman now expects a fully franked $1.65 per share dividend in FY 2024. Based on the current Westpac share price of $26.66, this equates to a 6.2%  dividend yield . Looking ahead, the broker now expects a $1.50 per share fully franked dividend in FY 2025. This is up from its previous estimate of $1.44 per share and represents a 5.6% dividend yield. It is the same story in FY 2026, with Goldman now expecting another $1.50 per share dividend instead of $1.44 per share previously. This will mean another attractive 5.6% dividend yield for income investors that year. This trend is expected to continue in FY 2027, with its analysts pencilling in another $1.50 per share fully franked dividend. This of course represents a third consecutive 5.6% dividend yield for investors to look forward to. Overall, the outlook for the Westpac dividend has improved since the release of the bank's results and above-average yields are on the cards for the foreseeable future."},

This is because it allows investors to take advantage of the power of  compounding . This is what happens when you generate returns on top of returns. To demonstrate just how successful this investment strategy can be with ASX 200 shares, I like to look at how much a single $20,000 investment in certain shares 10 years ago would be worth today. Let's now see how investments in these three shares have fared during this time: Cochlear Limited  ( ASX: COH ) It is fair to say that this manufacturer and distributor of cochlear implantable devices for the hearing-impaired has been a great ASX 200 share to own over the last decade. Due to its industry-leading position, sizeable investment in research and development, its wide distribution network, and ageing populations across the globe, Cochlear has delivered consistently strong sales and earnings growth. This has led to Cochlear's shares providing investors with an average total return of 19.4% per annum over the last 10 years. This would have turned a $20,000 investment into almost ~$120,000 today. NextDC Ltd  ( ASX: NXT ) Another ASX 200 share that has been lighting up the ASX boards over the past decade has been data centre operator, NextDC. Thanks to strong demand for capacity in its data centres due to the structural shift to the cloud, and now the artificial intelligence boom, its revenue and operating earnings have been growing at a rapid rate. This has led to the ASX 200 share outperforming the market since 2014 with an average total return of 26.1% per annum. This means that a $20,000 investment in NextDC shares back then would have grown to be worth just over $200,000 today. Northern Star Resources Ltd ( ASX: NST) Finally, this gold mining giant has been a star performer on the ASX 200 over the past 10 years. This has been underpinned by the company's transformation from a relatively small gold miner to one of the largest in the industry. A booming gold price has also been very helpful in recent times, driving its shares 30% higher over the last six months. This has led to the company's shares smashing the market return since 2014. Over the period, Northern Star's shares have generated an average return of 30.5% per annum. This would have turned a $20,000 investment into almost $290,000 today."},
{"source_name": "The Motley Fool", "title": "Should you buy BHP stock on a pullback?", "title_link": "https://www.fool.com.au/2024/05/11/should-you-buy-bhp-stock-on-a-pullback/", "published_date": "May 11, 2024", "publisher_name": "Tristan Harrison", "Description": "The  BHP Group Ltd  ( ASX: BHP ) stock price has suffered a 15% fall this year, as the chart below shows. Is it time to dig into the  ASX mining share ? I'll give my view on the business. What's going on with the BHP share price? I think three main dynamics are at play with the recent BHP share price movements – the takeover play for  Anglo American , changing commodity prices and costly write-offs. Before the  FY24 first-half result , BHP reported it was going to recognise  impairment charges  amounting to US$6.6 billion (pre-tax) relating to its nickel mining in Australia and the Samarco disaster in Brazil. According to  Trading Economics , the key commodity  iron ore  has declined from US$140 per tonne at the start of the year to around US$117 per tonne. BHP launched an audacious bid for Anglo American, with an all-share offer for the UK-listed miner. While that business owns good copper assets, with a quality iron ore segment, it also comes with several other assets that BHP doesn't want (eg, Anglo Platinum and Kumba), which complicates the deal. Anglo American has already rejected the initial offer, so BHP would need to up the bid to gain interest. Are there positives for the ASX mining share? The BHP stock price is close to its 2024 low and 52-week low, yet conditions seem to be improving for the business. The iron ore price has bounced upwards from around US$100 per tonne at the start of April 2024 to US$117 now – it's going in the right direction. That is boosting BHP's potential profitability, which is usually what investors focus on. Copper prices are near a two-year high of around US$4.7 per pound, which is good for BHP. According to Trading Economics:   Official trade data from China showed that imports of copper ore jumped by 11.8% from the previous year to 2.35 million tonnes in April, indicating that the world's top producer of refined copper continued to take in large volumes of inputs despite the sharp increase in prices.    The figures were in line with the pickup in factory activity indicated by the country's PMIs during the period.   My 2 cents on the BHP stock price The BHP share price is still almost 20% higher than its 2022 low, so it's not as cheap as it has been. But, with the increasing copper and iron ore prices, the company's profitability is more compelling. The  Samarco  costs are large and necessary but are proposed to be payable over more than a decade. I think the company's focus on decarbonisation commodities like potash and copper is a good move. Diversifying profit away from just selling iron ore to China is also good.  Because of the above issues, the  dividend  payments may be smaller in the short term, so I'd be in no rush to buy it for dividends.  I have a goal of trying to beat the market, so I don't think it's cheap enough yet to invest. However, if the BHP stock price did fall — say to below $40 — then that could be the right time to pounce."},

As the chart below shows, the  S&P/ASX 200 Index  (ASX: XJO) has weakened since hitting its all-time peak of 7,910.5 points on 2 April.  In a recent  Market Matters newsletter , Gerrish said he was still bullish on equities but pointed out that ASX defensive shares were a good way to  hedge  your bets (just in case your plans go pear-shaped!)  Gerrish said:    As equities have struggled over recent weeks, we've been asked several times whether this was a good time to allocate additional capital into the market …   … we are still bullish towards equities over the medium term primarily because we see  interest rate  cuts unfolding over the next 12-18 months, a very bullish backdrop for stocks.    However, Gerrish said successful investing required preparation for good and bad eventualities.    … obviously, not all stocks/ sectors  move as one, and if we are wrong and stocks are going to enter a tough few years, the defensive end of town should, in theory, outperform.    Fundie backs Telstra shares and 4 other defensive stocks  Gerrish and his Market Matters funds management team have provided an update on how they view the following five well-known ASX defensive shares. They are listed below in order of the team's preference.  AGL Energy Ltd ( ASX: AGL ) shares  Market Matters is long and bullish on AGL shares. The team likes AGL for its future  yield  expansion and potential capital gain. Market Matters holds AGL shares in the Active Income Portfolio. APA Group ( ASX: APA ) shares  Market Matters is also long and bullish on APA shares and holds the stock in the same portfolio. The team believes the  risk vs. reward  is attractive below $8.50 per share for this infrastructure stock.  Gerrish says:    The infrastructure stock has been under pressure for almost two years, falling over 36% from its lofty 2022 high above $12.    The stock has been weighed down by several headwinds, but if we are correct and central banks start cutting rates in 2024/5, it will finally enjoy a macro tailwind that should support it.    We continue to see value in APA as a defensive infrastructure holding, supported by its sustainable and growing yield in the 6-7% region.   Metcash Ltd ( ASX: MTS ) shares  Gerrish says his team's positive view on Metcash shares is predicated on the company's growing proportion of earnings coming from higher growth areas such as hardware. Market Matters is also long and bullish on Metcash shares. The team reckons it is cheap compared to its peers and offers good value around the $3.80 mark.  Telstra Group Ltd ( ASX: TLS ) shares The Market Matters team likes Telstra shares for yield and holds a long position in its Active Income Portfolio.  Gerrish explains their view on the ASX 200  telco :    We bought TLS at good levels in 2021, and it has been delivering a solid yield since.    TLS has been nudging 12-month lows over recent weeks, which is rarely a good sign. As it approaches $3.50, we believe value is returning to the telco, but … TLS needs to address costs to regain investor confidence.   Woolworths Group Ltd ( ASX: WOW ) shares Market Matters is \"cautiously bullish\" on Woolworths shares at about the $31 per share mark.  Gerrish said the market had lost confidence in the company, with CEO Brad Banducci's recently exiting.  He said:    The supermarkets find themselves in the unenviable political crosshairs ahead of a tight election. They are accused of price gouging when the cost of living pressures are extreme.    New CEO Amanda Bardwell may have inherited WOW at a good time to turn the company's fortunes around. Their 1H24 result in February was a disappointment, and the stock hasn't recovered since.   Over the past 5-years, WOW has traded on average  PE multiple  of 23.85x, but has seen extremes of 31x and 19x.    Currently, WOW trades on 21x earnings making it 11% 'cheap' vs. history, and we believe it is likely to be a decent turnaround story in 2025.   Foolish takeaway  Gerrish concludes by saying it's too early in the cycle to be aggressively overweight in ASX defensive stocks. However, some value is presenting itself with Telstra shares and the other four ASX shares listed above."},

For example, the three listed below have been named as buys and described as cheap by analysts. Here's what you need to know about them: Inghams Group Ltd  ( ASX: ING ) This poultry company could be undervalued according to analysts at Morgans. Particularly given its market leadership and low  price to earnings multiple . It recently said:   ING remains undervalued trading on a low PE multiple, especially for what is a market leader, with a vertically integrated operating model and assets that are difficult and costly to replicate. It is also leveraged to poultry – the affordable, healthy, sustainable and growth protein. Additionally, ING offers an attractive fully franked dividend yield.   Morgans has an add rating and $4.40 price target on its shares. The broker also expects 5.5%+ fully franked dividend yields from its shares in the coming years. Rural Funds Group  ( ASX: RFF ) Another ASX share that could be cheap is Rural Funds. That's the view of analysts at Bell Potter. They believe the market is undervaluing the rural property company's shares given their significant discount to net asset value (NAV). The broker explains:   RFF continues to trade at a material 26% discount to 1H24 reported NAV and 35% discount to 1H24 market NAV, with the disconnect between private and public asset values at historically high levels. In the near term disposing of assets at or around market value is a positive catalyst for NAV confirmation and debt reduction, while recovering commodity values benefits farm related earnings and counterparty profitability.   Bell Potter has a buy rating and $2.40 price target on its shares. It also expects dividend yields of approximately 5.8% in FY 2024 and FY 2025. Woolworths Limited  ( ASX: WOW ) Finally, Goldman Sachs thinks Woolworths is a cheap ASX share to buy following recent share price weakness. The broker highlights that the supermarket giant's shares are trading on multiples materially lower than recent averages. This is despite having a positive outlook. It explains:   We forecast WOW 2-yr sales CAGR FY24-26e of +3.2% and EBIT growth of +4.8%. The stock is trading at FY24E P/E of 20x vs 2-yr EPS CAGR of 6% and against an average of 26x since 2018.   Goldman currently has a buy rating and $39.40 price target on its shares. It also expects 3.4%+ dividend yields in the coming years."},

In afternoon trade, the benchmark index is up 0.5% to 7,759.5 points. Four ASX shares that have failed to follow the market higher today are listed below. Here's why they are falling: Cettire Ltd  ( ASX: CTT ) The Cettire share price is down 2% to $3.12. This is despite there being no news out the online luxury retailer. However, this decline could have been driven by concerns over consumer spending following a series of subdued updates from retailers this week. The team at Bell Potter is likely to see this as a buying opportunity. Earlier this week, the broker retained its buy rating and $4.00 price target on the company's shares. De Grey Mining Limited  ( ASX: DEG ) The De Grey Mining share price is down 2% to $1.24. Investors have been selling this gold developer's shares following the completion of an institutional entitlement offer and placement. De Grey Mining has raised approximately $514.3 million at a discount of $1.10 per new share. Proceeds from the equity raising, together with existing cash, are expected to fully fund the equity component of the project financing for the Hemi Gold Project in Western Australia. Managing Director, Glenn Jardine, believes the support from existing and new shareholders \"reflects the high quality of the Hemi Gold Project at a global level.\" Life360 Inc  ( ASX: 360 ) The Life360 share price is down 3% to $15.00. This follows the release of the location technology company's  first quarter update . Although Life360 delivered very strong growth across the board, the market appears to have been expecting management to lift its guidance for the full year. However, this has only been reiterated despite its impressive start to the financial year. It continues to expect to report consolidated revenue of US$365 million to US$375 million and adjusted EBITDA of US$30 million to US$35 million. The Life360 share price was down as much as 9% at one stage on Friday before rebounding strongly off its lows. Neuren Pharmaceuticals Ltd  ( ASX: NEU ) The Neuren Pharmaceuticals share price is down almost 2% to $18.98. Investors have been selling this pharmaceuticals company's shares since the release of its quarterly sales update on Thursday. That update revealed that its partner,  Acadia Pharmaceuticals  ( NASDAQ: ACAD ) achieved net sales of Daybue in the United States of US$75.9 million. This was a touch short of its guidance of US$76 million to US$82 million. Nevertheless, Acadia reiterated its FY 2024 guidance for net sales of between US$370 million and US$420 million."},

How happy? Well, one month ago, you could have bought shares in the Australian-owned African mineral sands producer for 12 cents apiece. Today, those same shares are trading for 26 cents, up 117%. Investors who bought the ASX mining stock three weeks ago on 19 April, when Base Resources shares were trading for 11 cents, will be sitting even prettier. The stock is up 134% since then. Here's what's been piquing investor interest. What's been sending the ASX mining stock through the roof? The vast majority of the Base Resources share price gains were delivered on a single day. On Monday, 22 April, the ASX mining stock closed the day up an eye-watering 123.8%. Investors were snapping up shares after Base Resources  reported  it had entered into a binding scheme implementation deed with United States-based uranium and critical minerals producer  Energy Fuels Inc.  (TSE: EFR). The deal would see Energy Fuels acquire all of Base Resources' shares for an offer price of 30.2 cents per share, some 16% above current levels and a whopping 188% higher than the share price the day before the takeover offer announcement. Absent a superior proposal, the ASX mining stock's board unanimously recommended shareholders vote in favour of the  acquisition . Commenting on the potential benefits for its Toliara Project, Base Resources managing director Tim Carstens said:   The combined group will have the financial and technical capability to not only build Toliara into one of the best critical mineral projects in the world, but also to develop an integrated value chain for the rare earth elements that are essential to the global energy transition.   Carstens noted that the proposed transaction was \"the culmination of 12 months of discussions between Base Resources and Energy Fuels\". Base Resources quarterly update The ASX mining stock gained another 2% on 30 April following the release of its quarterly  update  for the three months to 31 March. Base Resources said the challenging market conditions over the past few quarters stabilised over the previous three months as demand improved and \"some downstream re-stocking supported flat pricing across all products\". Turning to the balance sheet, the company held cash of US$83 million and no debt at the end of the quarter. As for the transaction with Energy Fuels, the ASX mining stock said its independent expert, PwC, has commenced work, as has the independent technical specialist, AMC Consultants."},

In afternoon trade, the benchmark index is up 0.45% to 7,757.1 points. Four ASX shares that are rising more than most today are listed below. Here's why they are climbing: Comet Ridge Ltd  ( ASX: COI ) The Comet Ridge share price is up over 5% to 20 cents. This morning, this energy explorer revealed that it has been awarded a $5 million grant from the Queensland Government to undertake a pilot test in Comet Ridge's 100% held Mahalo East block. The company's managing director, Tor McCaul, said: \"Comet Ridge is very pleased to be the recipient of a Frontier Gas Exploration Grant, a further endorsement of the significant position that Comet Ridge has established in the Mahalo Gas Hub area within the Bowen Basin.\" Kingsgate Consolidated Limited  ( ASX: KCN ) The Kingsgate Consolidated share price is up 10% to $1.74. This has been driven by the release of an update on the company's Chatree gold mine in Thailand. That update reveals that Plant 1 at the gold mine has now been permitted to operate. This follows a successful inspection by the Department of Primary Industries and Mines. As a result, full commissioning of Plant 1 will commence immediately, followed by a ramp up to full operations. News Corporation  ( ASX: NWS ) The News Corporation share price is up almost 4% to $38.72. This morning, analysts at Goldman Sachs responded positively to the media giant's quarterly update. The broker said: \"Earnings were largely in-line with our prior expectations (EBITDA +1% vs. GSe), with strength in Digital Real Estate, books and News Media offsetting a softer Dow Jones & Other.\" In light of this, the broker has reiterated its buy rating with a $44.70 price target. This implies potential upside of over 15% for investors from current levels. St Barbara Ltd  ( ASX: SBM ) The St Barbara share price is up 12.5% to 27 cents. Investors have been buying this gold miner's shares following the release of an update on its Simberi operation. St Barbara advised that its concept study supports 10+ years of production at Simberi. It estimates average annual gold production rising from 70,000 ounces to 75,000 ounces by FY 2027 and then to 230,000 ounces through to FY 2034. This will lead to total gold production of 2 million ounces.

This  ASX 200 bank stock  began this month at $28.16 a share. But today, those same shares are trading for $29.20 each. That's up a healthy 1.41% today alone and means that ANZ shares have enjoyed a 3.6% rise since the end of April. It appears investors have given their tick of approval to the half-year earnings report that ANZ delivered earlier this week. As  we covered at the time , these earnings revealed that ANZ suffered a 4% drop in statutory profits after tax to $3.41 billion for the six months to 31 March. Cash profits also fell by 1%, down to $3.55 billion. However, the capital returns that ANZ announced seemed to give investors their biggest confidence boost. ANZ revealed that its shareholders would enjoy the benefits of an additional $2 billion share buyback program going forward. The bank also declared an interim  dividend  of 83 cents per share, which was  up 2.5% over last year's interim dividend of 81 cents per share . This fresh dividend will only come  partially franked  at 65%. ANZ wasn't messing around, though. The  ex-dividend cutoff date  for this upcoming payout was set for less than one week later, on 13 May, to be precise. That's next Monday. Should you buy ANZ shares before next week's ex-dividend cutoff? This means that anyone who doesn't already own ANZ shares but wants to enjoy this latest dividend has until the close of trading today to buy ANZ shares. Anyone who buys them from Monday onwards (or sells out before today's closing bell) will miss out this time. Eligible investors will then get the cash from this dividend (or the additional shares if the optional  dividend reinvestment plan  is utilised) on 1 July. So those are the rules. But should investors buy ANZ before this dividend disappears forever? Just to get this straight, there are no free lunches in the investing world. If you buy ANZ shares today as opposed to next Monday, you won't get this dividend 'for free'. Whenever a share goes ex-dividend, you can expect to see its shares fall by roughly the same value as what said dividend was worth. This latest ANZ dividend is worth 83 cents per share. This effectively means that when ANZ opens on Monday, its share price will be approximately 83 cents lower than where it would have been without the ex-dividend factor. So you can either buy ANZ shares at a higher price today and bag this dividend, or you can wait until they are cheaper on Monday, but don't come with the rights to the dividend attached. It's fairly close to a zero-sum game, and if any investors try to chase the  arbitrage  between the two, they will probably come out disappointed. No free ASX lunches, even for bank stocks For a long-term investor, it won't make too much difference if you buy today or Monday. Your overall returns probably won't differ by much at all. So if you were already keen on buying ANZ shares for dividend income, you might want to seize your chance this Friday. But if you are just building out a position in ANZ as a long-term investment, don't let this tricky situation throw you off your game. At the current ANZ share price, this ASX 200 bank stock sports a dividend yield of 6.08%."},

This has led to the release of a number of broker notes. Three broker buy ratings that you might want to know more about are summarised below. Here's why brokers think these ASX shares are in the buy zone: Neuren Pharmaceuticals Ltd  ( ASX: NEU ) According to a note out of Bell Potter, its analysts have retained their buy rating on this pharmaceutical company's shares with a slightly trimmed price target of $26.50. This follows the release of an update on Daybue sales in the United States. While those sales were just short of guidance, this was driven by pre-flagged seasonality impacts. The good news is that FY 2024 guidance remains unchanged. In light of this, Bell Potter is expecting another standout year for Neuren. In addition, the broker is eagerly awaiting phase 2 clinical readouts from the company's second drug candidate, NNZ-2591. It notes that Pitt Hopkins Phase 2 results are due in the current quarter, followed by Angelman results in the third quarter. The Neuren share price is trading at $19.00 on Friday. REA Group Ltd  ( ASX: REA ) A note out of Morgan Stanley reveals that its analysts have reaffirmed their overweight rating and $210.00 price target on this property listings company's shares. This follows the release of a quarterly update which revealed very strong sales and earnings growth from the realestate.com.au operator. The broker notes that REA Group slightly outperformed analyst expectations. It also significantly outperformed its closest rival, which is cementing its market leadership position further. This bodes well for the future and supports the broker's forecast for further solid growth in the near term. The REA share price is fetching $187.43 this afternoon. TechnologyOne Ltd  ( ASX: TNE ) Analysts at Goldman Sachs have retained their buy rating on this enterprise technology company's shares with an improved price target of $18.10. The broker has been looking ahead to TechnologyOne's half year results release later this month. It is expecting the company to report annual recurring revenue growth of 35%, which will be a touch ahead of consensus estimates. All in all, the broker believes the company is performing above expectations for ARR and earnings growth and that this is not being fully reflected in its valuation. As a result, Goldman believes that now would be a good time for investors to snap up its shares. The TechnologyOne share price is trading at $16.36 on Friday afternoon."},

At the close of trading, the ASX 200 had gained 0.35% and was back above 7,740 points. But let's talk about what went on with the  ResMed Inc  ( ASX: RMD ) share price. Resmed shares performed slightly better than the broader market. The  ASX 200 healthcare stock  closed 0.43% higher at $32.34 after rising even higher this morning to $32.71 a share, a gain worth just over 1.5% at the time. This green day for Resmed came despite some potentially difficult news for investors to digest. According to a  United States Securities and Investments Commission (SEC) filing , ResMed CEO Michael J. Farrell has just sold a significant chunk of shares. Remember, Resmed is a dual-listed share and has a home both on the ASX and the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker  ResMed Inc  ( NYSE: RMD ). The company's base is also in America, in the Californian city of San Diego. This SEC filing shows that Farrell disposed of 14,683 Resmed shares on 7 May (US time) this week. These sales were executed at an average share price of US$216.50. That means Farrell would have bagged a cool US$3,178,815, which is approximately $4.81 million in our local currency. There was no explanation given for these Resmed share sales. However, the plot thickens when we examine another two transactions reported on the same day. Why has the ResMed CEO been selling shares? The filing also shows that Farrell acquired 14,683 shares on 7 May. So Farrell has apparently bought and then sold $4.81 million worth of Resmed shares on the same day. Well, not quite. The acquisition price of these shares was listed as US$84.98 – a far cry from the US$216.50 selling price. This implies that these shares were converted from options that the CEO possessed. It appears that Farrell's options were exercised and converted into ordinary Resmed shares, which were promptly sold. Should investors be worried? Well, that's up to them. All investors like to see their company's management teams align themselves financially with investors as much as possible. That means owning as many shares as they can. When CEOs and other senior management figures sell out of said shares, it can cause some understandable consternation. However, it must also be remembered that most managers tend to try to follow the rules of good wealth management, which most would agree includes at least somewhat diversifying one's wealth. Unless you're Warren Buffett, having most of your net worth tied up in one stock investment is rarely a good idea. This might be a case of Farrell doing just that when it comes to Resmed shares. Perhaps the CEO has a large tax bill coming up or wants to buy a new house. Before investors follow Farrell and sell out of their shares (which doesn't appear to be happening anyway, judging by the recent share price performance), keep in mind that Farrell still owns a significant chunk of the company. The SEC filing shows that the CEO retains 440,752 Resmed shares (presumably the NYSE-listed stock) even after this week's sale. Those would have a value of US$95.57 million today."},
{"source_name": "The Motley Fool", "title": "Are Telstra shares a top buy for dividend income?", "title_link": "https://www.fool.com.au/2024/05/10/are-telstra-shares-a-top-buy-for-dividend-income/", "published_date": "May 10, 2024", "publisher_name": "Tristan Harrison", "Description": "Telstra Group Ltd  ( ASX: TLS ) shares have been a popular pick for  dividend  income for a while. There are plenty of reasons why this could be the best time to invest for years.  The  ASX telco share  is best known for its mobile network, but the business has a few other segments that also seem appealing to me. Before I get to that, let's look at the dividend credentials of Telstra. Growing dividend The NBN transition was a difficult period for Telstra and its dividend, with the dividend and profit taking a hit. However, now that the business is through that challenging change, it's seeing regular profit growth and dividend increases. That's what I want to see from a good  ASX dividend share , particularly in this period of elevated  inflation  – dividend growth can offset higher expenses in our personal lives. The Telstra interim dividend was  increased  by 5.9% to 9 cents per share. This translates into an annualised grossed-up  dividend yield  of 7%, which is materially more than what anyone can get from a savings account at the moment. Estimates on Commsec suggest it could pay a grossed-up dividend yield of 7.4% in FY25 and 7.8% in FY26. Infrastructure and data  I think there is one key factor that will help Telstra continue to deliver profit growth and dividend growth for the foreseeable future. It's the ongoing growth of subscriber numbers – it seems many people are attracted to the telco's market-leading network reliability and coverage. That helps attract subscribers and allows the business to keep investing in its network, keeping it at the number one spot. There are two other promising areas that I'll point to for the future of Telstra shares. The first is that it is working on growing its wireless home broadband offering. If it can get more people using this 5G-powered broadband, Telstra will be able to capture a lot of the margin that is currently going to the NBN. Higher profit margins could help grow the  net profit after tax (NPAT) . Another very promising development is the massive amount of data that is being used and processed in Australia (eg AI). That data has to get into Australia somehow, and Telstra owns a significant amount of subsea cable. Telstra is also investing in its own fibre network for  extra capacity between capital cities . The huge growth of data centres could lead to more demand that Telstra carries through its networks, which is likely to be a boost for earnings over the long term.  I think the Telstra share price is compelling for the company's defensive nature. According to Commsec, Telstra shares are valued at 17x FY26's estimated earnings. I think it's a very good time to invest for the long-term."},

After everything that's happened recently, is this the right time to hunt for hidden gems? Names like  Altium Limited  ( ASX: ALU ),  Pro Medicus Ltd  ( ASX: PME ) and  REA Group Ltd  ( ASX: REA ) were all very small businesses over a decade ago. Now they're all multi-billion dollar companies. Not every company will turn out as successful as that, but the small end of the market can be an exciting hunting ground. Difficult environment for ASX small-cap shares The market has faced a lot of disruption and volatility over the last two or so years because of elevated inflation and higher interest rates. Fund manager  Monash Investors  has suggested over the last two years it has taken the market longer than usual to reward stocks that experience a (positive) step change in their outlook. This is because of a lower risk tolerance due to the \"upward momentum in  inflation  and  interest rates \". In this situation, Monash Investors said, the  ASX large-cap stocks  have tended to do well because of their \"strong  balance sheets , more stable businesses and better share market  liquidity \". Inflation has supposedly largely benefited the revenue growth and profits of large companies, which are \"more likely than small companies to have the pricing power to pass on inflationary pressures to preserve, or even grow, their margins\". Is this the time to invest? Monash Investors certainly thinks so, commenting:   However, now that inflation is moderating and the market is anticipating interest rate cuts, we are moving into a much more favourable environment for small caps. Looking forward the large cap stocks generally have modest growth outlooks, while the headwinds to small cap growth are abating. If history is any guide to the future, investors will increasingly look to invest in the smaller end of the market.   Some of the positions that appeared to be in the  Monash Investors Sml Companies Trust  (Hedge Fund) ( ASX: MAAT )  portfolio  within the last couple of months included  Johns Lyng Group Ltd  ( ASX: JLG ),  Credit Corp Group Limited  ( ASX: CCP ),  Austin Engineering Ltd  ( ASX: ANG ),  NRW Holdings Limited  ( ASX: NWH ) and  Monadelphous Group Ltd  ( ASX: MND ).

The benchmark index fell 1% to 7,721.6 points. Will the market be able to bounce back from this on Friday and end the week on a high? Here are five things to watch: ASX 200 poised to rebound The Australian share market looks set to end the week on a positive note thanks to a strong session on Wall Street. According to the latest SPI futures, the ASX 200 is expected to open 19 points or 0.25% higher this morning. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones was up 0.85%, the S&P 500 rose 0.5%, and the NASDAQ was 0.3% higher. Oil prices rise ASX 200 energy shares such as  Beach Energy Ltd  ( ASX: BPT ) and  Karoon Energy Ltd  ( ASX: KAR ) could have a good finish to the week after oil prices edged higher overnight.  According to Bloomberg , the WTI crude oil price is up 0.8% to US$79.60 a barrel and the Brent crude oil price is up 0.7% to US$84.19 a barrel. Oil prices have been pushing higher since the US revealed lower than expected stockpiles. Life360 results The  Life360 Inc  ( ASX: 360 ) share price will be one to watch when the location technology company releases its first quarter update. Last month, the company revealed that it had delivered record numbers during the quarter. This includes increasing its global monthly active users (MAU) by 4.9 million to 66.4 million. However, it didn't reveal what impact this had on its revenue and earnings. That will be unveiled with today's update. Gold price rises ASX 200 gold shares including  Evolution Mining Ltd  ( ASX: EVN ) and  Northern Star Resources Ltd  ( ASX: NST ) could have a very good session after the gold price surged higher overnight. According to CNBC, the  spot gold price  is up 1.3% to US$2,352.9 an ounce. This was driven by the release of US jobs data, which was supportive of rate cuts. Sell CBA shares Goldman Sachs has run the ruler over the  Commonwealth Bank of Australia  ( ASX: CBA ) quarterly update. Unfortunately, the broker has seen nothing to change its mind that the banking giant's shares are overvalued at current levels. It has reiterated its sell rating with an improved price target of $82.61. It said: \"While CBA's volume momentum in housing lending has improved and BDDs charges remain benign, we do not believe this justifies the extent of its valuation premium to peers.\""},

Well then, you really are living in the lucky country. The ASX offers a range of high-quality dividend stocks you may wish to add to your portfolio. And unlike many international exchanges, like stock markets in the United States, many ASX-listed companies pay  franked  dividends. That can come in quite handy when it comes time to pay the ATO its pound of flesh each year. If I had a spare $7,000 to invest right now, I'd lean towards buying larger companies listed on the  S&P/ASX 200 Index  (ASX: XJO).  ASX 200  dividend stocks tend to have less  volatile  share price moves than their smaller peers. And many have lengthy track records of delivering reliable passive income to their shareholders. I'd also prefer companies that pay franking credits. And I'd aim to invest in ASX dividend stocks that I believe will grow their payouts over the time they're in my portfolio without sacrificing share price growth. With $7,000 to invest, I'd likely only buy two stocks right now to get a decent exposure without burning too much on brokerage fees. You'll notice both these companies operate in distinctly different sectors. Over time, I'd look to build up my income portfolio to 10 or so stocks for some proper  diversification . With that said… Two ASX dividend stocks I'd buy now for passive income The first ASX dividend stock I'd buy for passive income now is ASX 200  bank stock   Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd  ( ASX: ANZ ). ANZ reported its half-year  results  on Tuesday. The big four bank's cash profit was down 1.0% year on year to $3.55 billion. However, management pleased shareholders by raising the interim dividend by 2.5%. That came in at 83 cents per share, franked at 65%. The good news is there's still time to grab that payout. Though not much! ANZ shares will trade ex-dividend on Monday. Meaning if I want to bank that passive income, I'd need to own shares at market close today. I can then expect to be paid on 1 July. Atop the interim dividend, ANZ paid a partly franked final dividend of 94 cents per share on 22 December. This equates to a full-year payout of $1.77 per share. At yesterday's closing price of $28.79, that works out to a yield (partly trailing, partly pending) of 6.15%. Which brings us to the second ASX dividend stock I'd buy now with my spare $7,000, ASX 200  oil and gas stock   Woodside Energy Group Ltd  ( ASX: WDS ). Woodside's dividends have come down over the past 12 months amid lower energy prices. The company was also struggling with regulatory approvals for its massive offshore Scarborough Energy Project. But Scarborough is now proceeding to plan again, and the oil price is firming up. The outlook for share price and income growth from this ASX dividend stock also  improved yesterday . That followed Federal Resources Minister Madeleine King's strong support for the long-term role of Australian gas in providing jobs and energy and helping the nation and its trading partners through the global energy transition. As for the past 12 months, Woodside paid an interim dividend of $1.243 per share on 28 September and a final dividend of 91.7 cents per share on 4 April, both fully franked. At yesterday's closing price of $28.10, this ASX dividend stock trades on a fully franked trailing yield of 7.69%."},

But which ones are buys? Three that have been tipped as best ideas by analysts at Morgans in May are listed below. Here's why they could be worth a look: Dalrymple Bay Infrastructure Ltd  ( ASX: DBI ) The first ASX dividend share to look at according to Morgans is coal terminal operator Dalrymple Bay Infrastructure. It has an add rating and $3.03 price target on its shares. The broker notes that the lack of appetite from ESG-focused investors means its shares are trading on low multiples and offering big yields. It said:   While DBI faces coal-related ESG headwinds, we think the stock may be attractive to income-oriented investors given its attractive cash yield (21.5 cps DPS guidance for the 12 months to June 2024). Furthermore, its CPI-linked and high margin revenues and numerous risk mitigants are enticing attributes for investors looking for a defensive element to their portfolios. Potential share price catalysts are value accretive organic capital investment and takeover potential.   Morgans expects  dividend yields  of 7.6% in FY 2024 and 7.8% in FY 2025. QBE Insurance Group Ltd  ( ASX: QBE ) Morgans believes that QBE would be a great option for income investors. It has an add rating and $17.96 price target on its shares. This bullish view is due largely to its attractive valuation, rate increases, and cost reductions. The broker explains:   With strong rate increases still flowing through QBE's insurance book, and further cost-out benefits to come, we expect QBE's earnings profile to improve strongly over the next few years. The stock also has a robust balance sheet and remains relatively inexpensive overall trading on 8x FY24F PE.   Its analysts are forecasting partially franked dividend yields of 5.6% in FY 2024 and 6.1% in FY 2025. Woodside Energy Group Ltd  ( ASX: WDS ) The broker also has this energy giant's shares on its best ideas list with an add rating and $36.00 price target. Its analysts think Woodside could be an ASX dividend share to buy thanks to its quality earnings and recent share price weakness. They said:   A tier 1 upstream oil and gas operator with high-quality earnings that we see as likely to continue pursuing an opportunistic acquisition strategy. WDS's share price has been under pressure in recent months from a combination of oil price volatility and approval issues at Scarborough, its key offshore growth project. With both of those factors now having moderated, with the pullback in oil prices moderating and work at Scarborough back underway, we see now as a good time to add to positions.   Morgans is forecasting fully franked dividend yields of 4.4% in FY 2024 and then 5.6% in FY 2025."},

The  banking  giant's shares ended the day over 2% lower at $117.09. Investors were hitting the sell button in response to the bank's  third quarter update . CBA reported a 1% decline in operating income for the three months ended 31 March. This reflects one less day in the quarter and slightly lower net interest margins due to continued competitive pressures and customers switching to higher yielding deposits. This ultimately led to Australia's largest bank reporting an unaudited statutory net profit after tax of $2.4 billion. This is down 3% on the first half average and 5% on the prior corresponding period. Also weighing on CBA shares were its rising arrears. While its balance sheet remains strong, CBA's arrears increased across home loans, credit cards, and personal loans. This was largely blamed on cost of living pressures. Has this pullback created a buying opportunity for investors or should they stay clear of the big four bank? Let's find out. Are CBA shares good value or overvalued? The team at Goldman Sachs has been looking over the result and was reasonably impressed, noting that its profits are run-rating ahead of second-half expectations. The broker said:   Cash profit from continuing operations in 3Q24 of c. A$2.4 bn was down 3% vs. 1H24 quarterly average and run-rating c. 4% ahead of what was implied by our prior 2H24E forecasts largely due to outperformance on the BDD charge. PPOP was in line with expectations.   However, unfortunately this still doesn't justify the significant premium that CBA shares trade at compared to the rest of the big four banks. Goldman adds:   While CBA's volume momentum in housing lending has improved and BDDs charges remain benign, we do not believe this justifies the extent of its valuation premium to peers, and note the 52% 12-month forward PPOP premium it is currently trading on versus peers (ex-dividend adjusted), compared to the 24% 15-year average.   In light of this, the broker has reiterated its sell rating with an improved price target of $82.61 (from $81.98). Based on the current CBA share price of $117.09, this implies potential downside of approximately 30% for investors over the next 12 months. The broker then concludes:   Coupled with i) a business mix that leaves it more exposed to the current competitive environment, and ii) while CBA has historically done a good job in balancing investment and productivity, we do not think it can escape elevated FY24E cost pressures given heightened inflation; we reiterate our Sell recommendation."},

A further 30% have only a vague idea or no idea of their superannuation balance today.  The results show a lack of engagement in superannuation planning and management within the Australian population, Findex says.  Let's investigate.  Do you know how much you've got in superannuation?  The survey shows that the knowledge gap is more pronounced among women and younger Australians.  Baby Boomers were the most likely to know their superannuation balance to the nearest $1,000. Fifty-one per cent of boomer respondents said they could name the number.  Gen Zs were the least likely generation to know their superannuation balance. The survey found that 26% had a vague idea, and 22% had no idea at all.  Of course, it's not surprising that baby boomers are more acutely aware of their superannuation balances. Born between 1946 and 1965 , the bulk of this generation is already well into their  retirement  years.  The youngest group within the baby boomers is turning 63 years old this year.  Their 'retirement age' — meaning the year they are eligible to receive the  age pension  — is only four years away at 67. So, they're much more likely to be crunching the numbers now to prepare for this change.  And with  the Bank of Mum and Dad expanding  into superannuation, many baby boomers have already shared some of their super monies with their kids to help them buy a house.  Why don't you know your super balance? Perhaps one of the reasons why so many Australians cannot name their super balance is because they don't know where to start in managing their superannuation.  The survey also revealed that 64% of respondents, or almost two-thirds of the population, do not feel confident about managing and growing their superannuation. As we've recently covered, Australians tend to  overestimate how much money they need in retirement .  A survey by Colonial First State revealed that, on average, Australians think they need $1.6 million in superannuation or savings for a comfortable retirement. No, no, no.  Not according to the official guidelines!  How much do you need for a comfortable retirement?  The Association of Super Funds of Australia (AFSA) publishes a regularly updated  Retirement Standard .  The standard says couples aged 65 to 84 years who own their own homes without debt need $690,000 in superannuation, plus a part-pension, to fund a 'comfortable lifestyle'. Annual living expenses for a comfortable existence are estimated at about $72,000 per couple.  Single retirees aged 65 to 84 years who own their own homes without debt need $595,000 in superannuation. Their living expenses run to about $51,000 per annum for a comfortable retirement.  ASFA also provides guidelines for a 'modest retirement'. In this case, both singles and couples need $100,000 in superannuation and a part pension to pay the bills. They also need to own their homes without a mortgage.  AFSA estimates living expenses of $46,944 for couples and $32,666 for singles aged 65 to 84 years. AFSA's estimates assume you will draw down all your super capital, invest it, and receive a 6% return per annum.  Do you have enough in superannuation yet?  If you're an 'average' Aussie aged 65 to 69 years, then you probably do.  The  latest Australian Taxation Office (ATO)  figures tell us the average superannuation balance for people aged 65 to 69 years is $428,738.  The average for men is $453,075, and the average for women is $403,038."},

But just because the ASX 200 lithium stock is popular, doesn't necessarily mean it is the best way to invest in lithium right now. For example, the team at Bell Potter currently has a hold rating and $3.60 price target on Pilbara Minerals' shares. This is notably lower than its current share price of $4.17. But one ASX 200 lithium stock that the broker is bullish on and tipping to rise materially from current levels is  Arcadium Lithium  ( ASX: LTM ). Why is it an ASX 200 lithium stock to buy? Bell Potter was pleased with Arcadium Lithium's first quarter update this week, noting that it delivered earnings ahead of its expectations but in line with consensus estimates. It said:   LTM reported Q1 2024 revenue of US$261m (BP est $268m) and Adjusted EBITDA of US$109m (BP est. $68m); overall the result was broadly in line with consensus.   It also notes that the company is forecasting more of the same over the remainder of FY 2024. Though, this will be dependent on realised lithium prices, which were strong during the first quarter. It adds:   The company has held full year 2024 scenarios for revenue (US$1.25-1.9b) and adjusted EBITDA (US$420-1,000m) based on market pricing ranges of US$15,000-25,000/t LCE. LTM achieved a Q1 2024 realised price of $20,500/t for carbonate and hydroxide products, materially higher than published indices due to fixed pricing and floors on a large proportion of hydroxide volumes.   Big returns In response to the update, the broker has retained its buy rating with a trimmed price target of $9.50. With the ASX 200 lithium stock currently trading at $7.07, this implies potential upside of 34% for investors over the next 12 months. To put that into context, a $10,000 investment would be worth almost $13,500 by this time next year if Bell Potter is on the money with its recommendation. Explaining its bullish view on the lithium miner, the broker concludes:   LTM provides the largest, most diversified exposure to lithium in terms of mode of upstream production, asset locations, downstream processing and customer markets. It is a key large-cap leverage to lithium prices and sentiment, which we expect to improve over the medium term. In supportive markets, LTM's growth pipeline could see the company more than double production over the next three years."},

We have  tracked this ETF for a while now , noting that it remains a strong choice for many Australian investors. This is arguably thanks in part to an enviable record of delivering market-beating returns. A high-flying ASX ETF To illustrate, the MOAT ETF has returned 17.59% over the 12 months to 30 April. It has also delivered an average of 14.83% per annum over the past five years, as well as 15.62% per annum since its ASX inception in 2015. This ETF has been able to achieve such stellar results by investing in a concentrated portfolio of US shares that are all selected on their perceived possession of what is known as an economic  moat . A moat is a term first used by legendary investor Warren Buffett. It refers to a company's inbuilt protections against competition. The wider this moat is, the more able a company is to maintain dominance in its field. This moat could come in the form of a strong brand ( Coca-Cola  or  Apple  are classic examples), or else a low-cost advantage that a company possesses at the expense of its competitors ( Amazon  or  Costco ). It could also take the shape of a good or service that consumers simply find too difficult to stop buying or using ( Microsoft 's Office or  Adobe 's Photoshop). Companies with the widest and most durable moats often make for the best long-term investments, as Warren Buffett has proven. Buffett has spoken extensively about the importance of an investment possessing a moat. We can see this strategy playing out in the current MOAT portfolio. At this ASX ETF's most recent filing, its top holdings included the likes of Google-owner  Alphabet, Campbell Soup, Nike, Pfizer, Disney  and Buffett's own  Berkshire Hathaway. So we've established that this ETF is a high flyer when it comes to returns. But let's talk about dividends. What kind of ASX dividend income does the Wide Moat ETF pay? It's fair to say that US shares are not known for their dividend firepower. Sure, there are many strong income payers on the US markets. But thanks to a number of factors, including the absence of a  franking system , it's not too common to find yields of 4% or 5% in the top echelons of the US markets, as it is on the ASX. An ASX index fund typically offers a 3%-5% starting dividend yield. However, a US index fund will be closer to 1%-2%. So what about the ASX's MOAT ETF? Well, an ETF can fund dividend distributions in two ways. The first is passing on any dividend income its underlying holdings payout. The second is distributing the profits from the regular rebalances that most ETFs conduct every quarter in order to reflect their underlying indexes. The VanEck Wide Moat ETF does a little of both. This means that its annual dividends (yes, investors receive just one dividend distribution every year) can vary rather wildly from year to year. To illustrate, MOAT units paid out a chunky $8.15 per unit in 2023. However, in January 2022, investors bagged just 98.11 cents per unit. The year before that, the figure came in at $1.01, whilst in 2020, investors received 88.1 cents per unit. So today, MOAT units are technically trading on a trailing dividend distribution yield of 6.48%. But given this ASX ETF's volatile dividend distribution history, I wouldn't be counting on this continuing over 2024."},

You only need to look at the performance of the ASX uranium stocks such as  Boss Energy Ltd  ( ASX: BOE ) and  Deep Yellow Limited  ( ASX: DYL ) to see this. Over the period, these uranium stocks are up a remarkable 155% and 94%, respectively. But if you thought the gains were over, think again. One little known ASX uranium stock has just been named as a buy and tipped to rise strongly from current levels. Which ASX uranium stock is a buy? According to a note out of Bell Potter, its analysts think that  Lotus Resources Ltd  ( ASX: LOT ) could be a top option right now. It owns an 85% interest in the Kayelekera Uranium Project in Malawi, Africa, and a 100% interest in the Letlhakane Uranium Project in Botswana, Africa. The broker was pleased with the recent mineral resource estimate (MRE) update for the the Letlhakane project. It commented:   The updated MRE stands at 155.3Mt at 345ppm U3O8 for a total contained 118.2Mlbs U3O8, inclusive of 34.4Mlbs in Indicated Resources, which is a reduction on the original ACB [previous owner] MRE (2015) of 190Mlbs at 321ppm U3O8. The main difference between the two estimates is the hypothesised operations, which infer the economic cut-off grade. Under ACB, LM was a large-scale, low-grade two stage heap leach operation. In our February initiation on LOT, we didn't see this as the path forward for the project. Our initial interpretation was that LOT would look to focus on the highgrade portions of the deposit and utilise ore-sorting to increase the milled grade over +600ppm. With a starting point of +400ppm, a conservative estimate of 40% mass rejection could achieve this we hypothesised. Today's announcement is a step towards proving that thesis.   Big returns In response to the news, the broker has reaffirmed its speculative buy rating on the ASX uranium stock with an improved price target of 60 cents. Based on its current share price of 44.5 cents, this implies potential upside of 35% for investors over the next 12 months. Commenting on its recommendation, the broker said:   We maintain a Speculative Buy recommendation and our valuation lifts to $0.60/sh (previously $0.50/sh). Our valuation lift comes from an extension of potential operations at LM beyond our initial forecast (initial LOM production of 61Mlbs). We see positive catalysts at KM including 1) MDA finalisation, 2) FID and 3) offtake negotiations. Successful navigation of these hurdles will place LOT in the best position to advance project funding for KM, all whilst LM advances in the background.   Though, it is worth highlighting the broker's speculative rating. This means it would only be suitable for investors with a high risk tolerance."},

The good news is that there are plenty of these trading on the Australian share market, making life easier for retirees. But which ASX retirement shares are analysts tipping as buys right now? Let's take a look at four: APA Group  ( ASX: APA ) This energy infrastructure company could be a great ASX retirement share to buy. Especially given its defensive earnings, long track record of growth, and big dividend yield. In respect to the latter, Macquarie is forecasting dividends of 56 cents per share in FY 2024 and 57.5 cents per share in FY 2025. Based on the current APA Group share price of $8.69, this equates to 6.4% and 6.6% dividend yields, respectively. Macquarie has an outperform rating and $9.40 price target on its shares. Coles Group Ltd  ( ASX: COL ) Supermarkets are another generator of defensive earnings. As providers of our daily essentials, consumers fill their trolleys each week no matter how much they raise their prices. Morgans believes the company's growth can continue and is forecasting fully franked dividends of 66 cents per share in FY 2024 and then 69 cents per share in FY 2025. Based on the current Coles share price of $16.28, this implies dividend yields of 4% and 4.2%, respectively. Morgans has an add rating and $18.95 price target on its shares. Telstra Corporation Ltd  ( ASX: TLS ) We can't go without food and, for many of us, we can't go without our phone or internet. This makes Telstra another very defensive ASX share that could be worth considering for a retirement portfolio. Especially with its shares falling heavily recently, making its valuation and dividend yields even more attractive. In respect to the latter, Goldman Sachs is forecasting fully franked dividends of 18 cents per share in FY 2024 and then 19 cents per share in FY 2025. Based on the current Telstra share price of $3.64, this equates to yields of 4.9% and 5.2%, respectively. Goldman has a buy rating and $4.55 price target on Telstra's shares. Woolworths Limited  ( ASX: WOW ) Finally, investors might want to consider another supermarket operator, Woolworths. For the same reasons as Coles, it could be a great option for an ASX retirement portfolio. Goldman Sachs certainly believes this is the case. Much like with Telstra, Woolworths shares have pulled back meaningfully recently, which the broker believes has created a compelling buying opportunity. Particularly given that its analysts \"forecast WOW 2-yr sales CAGR FY24-26e of +3.2% and EBIT growth of +4.8%.\" It expects this to support fully franked dividends of $1.08 per share in FY 2024 and $1.14 per share in FY 2025. Based on the current Woolworths share price of $30.78, this implies yields of 3.5% and 3.7%, respectively. Goldman has a buy rating and $39.40 price target on its shares."},

The youngsters see bank savings as a more compelling investment, with 38% of Gen Z and 20% of Millennials ranking savings as the most important type of investment for lifetime wealth-building.  In a statement, Findex commented:    While it is fair to say that this is a natural reflection of differing life stages, as a long-term investment, even small early-top ups to superannuation are more likely to deliver greater benefits in retirement.      Ultimately, this gap underscores the varying approaches to long-term financial planning and the need for heightened awareness among younger Australians.   Millennials and Gen Z have a super advantage  The survey findings are particularly interesting given Millennials and Gen Zs are the first generations that will have received superannuation contributions from their employers over their entire working lives.

The baby boomers were  born  between 1946 and 1965 and Gen X was born between 1966 and 1980. Millennials were born between 1981 and 1995 and Gen Z was born between 1996 and 2010.  Superannuation was  introduced in Australia  in 1992. The mandatory contribution rate for employers has risen from 3% in 1992 (or 4% for employers with an annual payroll above $1 million) to 11% today.  Most superannuation funds are primarily invested in ASX shares and international equities.  In 2023,  Chant West figures  show that the standard 'growth' superannuation fund comprised of 61% to 80% growth assets, like shares, delivered a median return of 9.9%.  Time on their side to build retirement savings  Time is considered a key component to investing success, especially when simple strategies like  compounding  are adopted.  The trick is to start investing as early as possible in life and invest more money as often as you can.  Findex co-CEO Tony Roussos said:   The current level of superannuation literacy presents a clear opportunity for Australians to proactively take charge of their financial future – especially Millennials and Gen Zs who will have had super contributions throughout their careers and also have the benefit of a longer runway towards retirement.   Roussos encouraged Millennials and Gen Z Australians to, \"Take advantage of the time you have on hand by exploring ways to build your balance so that your super works hard for you in retirement.\"  Key actions to ensure a secure retirement  Findex recommends the following key investment actions for Millennials and Gen Z Australians to take now to ensure  a good retirement  in the future.  Millennials   Findex recommends the following actions for Millennials to retire well:  Balancing homeownership and super savings Investigate 'rentvesting' as an alternative to traditional homeownership, allowing you to  invest in property  while maintaining flexibility and your superannuation contributions. Career progression and super contributions As income increases, take advantage of growth strategies, and periodically review and increase superannuation contributions to ensure they align with your retirement goals. Family planning and superannuation Plan for potential career breaks for family reasons. Consider strategies like spousal contributions or government co-contributions to maintain super growth during these periods.   Gen Z   Findex recommends the following actions for Gen Zs to retire well:  Assess your risk appetite and investment diversification Exploring options within superannuation that align with a longer investment timeline can enhance growth. Superannuation typically defaults to 'balanced' options, so younger generations might benefit from 'growth' strategies, aiming to optimise fund performance over time.   Early engagement with superannuation to build retirement savings Start contributing to super as early as possible. Even modest contributions can grow significantly over time due to the power of compounding interest.   Financial literacy and digital tools Leverage digital platforms like Young Money from the Findex Community Fund for financial education, and apps to help with budgeting and investment tracking. Understanding the basics of superannuation,  investment strategies , and  tax  advantages is crucial."},

Not only can you get a good look under the hood of two dominant businesses, but you can also see exactly how the market is valuing two sets of  cash flows  coming out of the same industry. It's hard to compare the  dividends  and earnings of a  bank , for example, against a  tech stock  and come to a coherent valuation case for both. But when two companies are both deriving their earnings from the same base, things get a lot more interesting. So today, let's put this into action by comparing the valuations of the two largest  supermarket operators and grocers  in Australia –  Woolworths Group Ltd  ( ASX: WOW ) and  Coles Group Ltd  ( ASX: COL ). Woolworths and Coles are great companies to compare, as they are direct competitors in the grocery space. Although both companies have auxiliary earnings streams – Coles' bottle shops and Woolies' Big W chain – both derive the lion's share of their earnings from their supermarket businesses. Normally, it would be easy to compare these two companies' valuations by looking at their  price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios  on an annualised basis. Woolies vs. Coles But thanks to some unusual disruptions in Woolies' recent earnings, this isn't very useful right now. At of yesterday's close, Woolies seems to trade on a ridiculous P/E ratio of 1,965.5, whilst Coles is on a far more normal 20.87. So instead, what we will do is take both companies' earnings per share from their recently-announced half-year results covering the six months to 31 December, and see how they compare. For those six months,  Woolies revealed  a basic  earnings per share (EPS)  of 76.2 cents, which was up 2% from the same period in 2021. At the last Woolworths share price of $30.78, this would give the company a P/E ratio of 40.49, or 20.2 on an annualised basis. In Coles' case,  the company reported  a basic EPS of 44.5 cents for the half year, which was down 8.5% on the prior corresponding period. At the last Coles share price of $16.28, this would give the company a P/E ratio of 36.58, or 18.29 on an annualised basis. So, on a like-for-like basis, Coles shares are currently cheaper than Woolworths shares. Put another way, investors are being asked to pay more for $1 in Woolworths earnings than $1 in Coles earnings. That's despite Woolworths shares having an awful year compared to its arch-rival. 2024 to date has seen the Coles share price rise 0.74%. In contrast, Woolies stock has collapsed by 17.94%. We can see this reflected in both companies'  dividend yields . Right now, Woolworths is trading on a dividend yield of 3.41%, but Coles offers a lot more with its 4.05% yield. So Coles shares are cheaper. But does that make them a better ASX 200 buy today? Which ASX 200 stock to buy? Normally, investors would feel justified in paying a higher share price relative to earnings for a higher-quality business. Until this year, it was obvious that Woolworths was the better ASX 200 blue-chip share compared with Coles, thanks to its higher market share. But recent updates from both companies have muddied the waters of that assumption. Earlier this month,  Woolworths reported  a 2.8% rise in total sales to $16.8 billion over the quarter ending 31 March. For the first three months of 2024, Woolies enjoyed a 1.5% rise in Australian food sales and a 1.4% uptick in New Zealand food sales. The company's B2B business stood out though, banking a 3.2% spike in sales. However,  Coles put up some far more impressive figures  over the same period. Coles revealed that its sales revenue for the quarter rose 6.4% over the previous year's equivalent quarter to $10.03 billion. Supermarket sales were up 5.1%, whilst liquor sales fell 1.9%. Foolish takeaway If I were deciding between these two blue-chip ASX 200 shares today for an investment, I would probably want to wait until I saw the next quarter's numbers before making a final decision. I would want to see Coles' superior quarter as part of a long-term trend, not just a one-off fluke. If this is the case, Coles could be the pick of the two today, given its lower P/E ratio and higher dividend yield. However, if I had to make the decision today, I would probably go for Woolworths shares. The company is trading at its lowest share price in years today, and yet remains the dominant grocer in the Australian market. The difference in earnings multiples between the two companies has rarely been as close as it currently is, at least going off the figures we used earlier. So, although Coles' recent numbers almost make it more appealing than Woolworths, I would still have to wait for a clear trend to emerge before taking the plunge with Coles today."},

In this article, we're going to look at how much money an investor with $5,000 might have made if that money was invested in the IVV ETF at the start of the year.   What has happened? It has been a great time to own a piece of the US share market. Some of the biggest global tech companies have been top performers. The iShares S&P 500 ETF owns 500 of the largest and most profitable businesses that are listed in the US. Since the start of 2024: The  Microsoft  share price has risen 10.7% The  Alphabet  share price has gone up 22.6% The  Amazon  share price has soared 25.4%. The  Meta Platforms  share price has shot higher by 36.5%. The  Nvidia  share price has jumped 87.7%. These are among the biggest businesses in the IVV ETF holdings, so they have had the biggest influence on the IVV ETF's overall returns. An ASX ETF's return is dictated by the performance of the underlying holdings. This portfolio has 500 holdings. Since the start of 2024, the IVV ETF has risen by 12.7% in Australian dollar terms. If we look at the  S&P 500 Index  (SP: .INX), which measures the S&P 500 in American dollar terms, it experienced a rise of 9.4%. How much $5,000 invested would be worth now With a 12.7% capital gain, $5,000 would be worth roughly $5,635. That's a pretty good gain in just four months and nine days. The IVV ETF has also paid distributions amounting to approximately 30 cents per unit, which translates into a distribution return of around 0.64% based on the ASX ETF's unit price at the start of 2024. That's a cash return of around $32 since the start of the year. So, in total, an investor's wealth would have increased by $667, with most of that return being capital growth (on paper).  Volatility  could be just around the corner and send the IVV ETF unit price even higher, or lower.  Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance, but the IVV ETF has done very well over the years, rising by an average of 16.2% per annum in the last decade thanks to the strength of the underlying businesses."},

In morning trade, the  lithium  developer's shares are up 1.5% to $1.42. Why are Liontown shares charging higher? Investors have been buying the company's shares this morning in response to a  project update . According to the release, Liontown has signed an agreement with  GR Engineering Services Ltd  ( ASX: GNG ) for the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract at the Kathleen Valley Lithium Project. This is for the delivery and commissioning of the Paste Plant facility to support the underground mining operations at Kathleen Valley. The release notes that the Paste Plant will include two trains capable of producing up to 160m3 of paste per hour and has been designed to accommodate future expansion of mining operations to 4Mtpa. Management highlights that the delivery of cemented paste fill is an integral part of the underground mining cycle at Kathleen Valley. That's because it maximises recovery of the underground orebody and planned production rates, as well as reduces the size of the surface tailings dam that would otherwise be required. The Paste Plant has also been designed to facilitate dry stacking and water recovery. This further increases the amount of recycled water the site utilises. What is the cost? The EPC is valued at approximately $71 million according to the company. The good news is that this forms part of planned and budgeted next stage of growth capital costs post first production and funding is covered by the recently announced $550 million financing facility. And with everything else running on time, investors will be pleased to learn that GR Engineering Services has progressed the design, procurement and initial site works under an early works agreement. This is to ensure timely delivery of the Paste Plant. Commenting on the agreement with GR Engineering Services, Liontown Resources' managing director and CEO, Tony Ottaviano, said:   We are pleased to award the contract for the design and construction of the Paste Plant which will support and further de-risk the planned underground production rates at Kathleen Valley. GRES has designed and constructed multiple paste plant facilities throughout Western Australia and the GRES team has mobilised and commenced initial works at Kathleen Valley.

In early trade, the ASX 200 tech stock is down 9% to $14.15. Why is the Life360 share price sinking? Investors have been selling the location technology company's shares today following the release of its  quarterly update . While some of the numbers were pre-released last month in a trading update, the ones that arguably matter most are now public knowledge and investors are responding negatively. According to the release, Life360 delivered a 15% year on year increase in revenue to US$78.2 million during the first quarter. This was driven largely by a 23% lift in core subscription revenue to US$57 million. At the end of the quarter, Life360's annualised monthly revenue (AMR) stood at US$284.7 million, which is up 19% year on year. This led to the company achieving positive adjusted  EBITDA  of US$4.3 million for the three months (up from US$0.5 million) and a reported EBITDA loss of US$4.1 million. What were the drivers of this result? A record quarter of subscription growth underpinned this solid result. Life360's global monthly active users (MAU) increased by 4.9 million during the three months to 66.4 million. This represents a 31% increase year on year. Management also notes that this was achieved with significant momentum, particularly in a seasonally lower period for MAU growth. Also increasing strongly was its global Paying Circle metric. It posted net additions of 96,000 for the quarter, which was a record. This was up 21% year on year and brings the total to 1.9 million. Management advised that this was supported by improved conversion and retention. Life360's co-founder and CEO, Chris Hulls, was pleased with the record quarter. He said: Life360's Q1'24 results showed continued momentum, with net Paying Circles additions nearly doubling to 96 thousand from 54 thousand in Q4'23, achieving a new first quarter record. In addition, our efforts in relation to both our free members and international expansion are paying off, with 4.9 million new Monthly Active Users (also a new first quarter record. Hulls doesn't believe the ASX 200 tech stock's growth is anywhere near over given its massive global market opportunity. He adds: The market opportunity is on a global scale, and we believe we have significant headroom to grow as we expand to new regions, and launch new features that expand our relevance to different life stages. Outlook Pleasingly, Hulls revealed that the second quarter has started strongly for Life360. He said: This momentum has continued so far in Q2'24 with the achievement of 32 thousand net Paying Circle additions during the month of April. Looking further ahead, the ASX 200 tech stock has maintained its guidance for FY 2024. It continues to expect to report consolidated revenue of US$365 million to US$375 million, adjusted EBITDA of US$30 million to US$35 million, and an EBITDA loss of US$8 million to US$13 million. It is likely to be this guidance that has put pressure on the Life360 share price today. Given its exceptionally strong start to the year, the market appears to have been expecting management to lift its guidance with this result. With no guidance upgrade coming, investors have been quick to hit the sell button. But that doesn't take away the fact that this is a high quality company growing at a rapid rate."},

That sees the PSC Insurance share price up an impressive 36% over the past six months. Investors are snapping up the stock after long-simmering takeover  rumours  were confirmed. ASX All Ords insurer soars on takeover deal After the market closed yesterday, PSC Insurance  reported  that it had entered into a binding Scheme Implementation Deed with The Ardonagh Group. Under the scheme, Ardonagh, one of the world's leading independent insurance broking groups, will acquire all of PSC's shares for $6.19 apiece.

Founded in 2017, Ardonagh is now a top 20 global broker with more than 10,000 employees across 30 countries. The company reported 2023 revenue of £1.6 billion (AU$3.0 billion).

Before you faint at the drastic decline, there's a rather simple and relieving explanation.  Shares in the banking major are 5.5% lower to $26.36 as we head into the afternoon. If it's any consolation, the  S&P/ASX 200 Index  (ASX: XJO) is 0.74% worse for wear. Aussie investors are skittish today as numerous ASX retail shares reveal underwhelming sales updates, further demonstrating weakness in consumer spending.  Back to Westpac… what is the catalyst sending this $92 billion bank to the bottom of the barrel today? Dividend deadline arrives for Westpac shares Don't worry, it's nothing catastrophic. It's merely the  ex-dividend  date.  This is when the company's shares begin trading without the claim to the next dividend payment. All shareholders on Westpac's share register yesterday will snag the 90 cents per share fully franked dividend, but anyone added to the list today will not.  As usual, the share price is falling to reflect the absent dividend value.  In this case, Westpac's dividend has a grossed-up value of about $1.29 after franking credits. Yesterday's closing price was $27.89. Take the former from the latter, and you end up with $26.60 — roughly in line with the current Westpac share price.  Shareholders can expect this interim dividend to land in their account on 25 June 2024.  CBA canary in the banking coal mine There's a chance  Commonwealth Bank of Australia 's ( ASX: CBA )  third-quarter update  is also weighing on Westpac today.  Investors tend to use information from other companies in the same industry to shape expectations. If CBA's update is anything to go by, the Australian banking sector might be cooling off.  Australia's largest bank experienced a 5% fall in unaudited statutory  net profit after tax  in Q3, easing to $2.3 billion. The weaker bottom line resulted from a 1% slip in operating income and a 2% increase in operating expenses.  The big four banks are all in the red day following the news.

Shares in the  S&P/ASX 200 Index  (ASX: XJO)  bank stock  closed yesterday trading for $119.74. In early afternoon trade on Thursday, shares are swapping hands for $117.59, down 1.8%. For some context, the ASX 200 is down 0.9% at this same time. This comes following the release of CBA's quarterly  update  for the three months ending 31 March. What did the big four bank report? Among the key financial metrics for the quarter, the bank reported a 1% year on year decrease in operating income. That dip came along with a 2% increase in operating expenses. Combined, this saw CommBank's unaudited statutory  net profit after tax  fall 5% from the prior corresponding quarter to $2.4 billion, which could explain why CBA shares are underperforming today. From a risk perspective, the bank remains well capitalised with a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 11.9%. That's well above the minimal 10.25% ratio required by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). Why are CBA shares under pressure today? CBA shares are sliding today despite what Citi called a \"positive result\" for the quarter, citing the improvement of  net interest margins (NIM) . According to Citi analyst Brendan Sproules (quoted by  The Australian ), \"The stabilisation and likely modest  improvement  in the NIM reflects, in our view, the stabilisation in retail banking, augmented by better channel mix in mortgages.\" Sproules added, \"We expect the market to receive the result well from a fundamental perspective, although the valuation still remains very challenging from our perspective.\" Indeed, it's the often-cited overvaluation of CBA shares relative to its peers that has a number of brokers forecasting price targets well below current levels. With the bank's $2.4 billion quarterly profit modestly exceeding consensus expectations, Evans & Partners  expects  we may see analysts boost their profit forecasts. \"We expect consensus core profit upgrades of ~2 per cent for FY25F and FY26F. Asset quality is deteriorating in similar fashion to that generally seen in other major bank results over the last week,\" the broker said (quoted by  The Australian Financial Review ). Despite that expectation, Evans & Partners has a 'sell' rating on CBA shares with an $80 price target. UBS also has a 'sell' rating on the biggest Australian bank, though with a higher price target of $105 a share. According to UBS (quoted by the AFR):   Despite a visible deterioration in asset quality metrics, we think the credit impairment charges today suggest some consensus upgrades are likely for 2H 24 cash earnings…   CBA continues to lean on its proprietary distribution channels to defend and drive volume growth in mortgages – a strategy which has so far seen CBA grow at 0.7x system. Defending back-book profitability remains a key imperative for management.   Despite today's retrace, CBA shares remain up a healthy 21% since this time last year."},

We look forward to updating the market further at the full year result in August.\" Westpac Banking Corp  ( ASX: WBC ) The Westpac share price is down over 5% to $26.42. There are a couple of reasons for this decline. One is weakness in the banking sector following the release of an update from a big four rival. The other is Westpac's shares going ex-dividend this morning for its interim and special dividends. Earlier this week, the bank released its half year results and declared a fully franked interim dividend of 75 cents per share (up 7.1%) and a special fully franked 15 cents per share dividend. These dividends will be paid to eligible shareholders on 25 June."},

In afternoon trade, the ASX 200 stock is up over 1% to $187.09. This compares favourably to a 0.8% decline by the benchmark ASX 200 index today. Why is this ASX 200 stock avoiding the market selloff? Investors have been fighting to get hold of the property listings company's shares on Thursday after it release its  third quarter update . For the three months ended 31 March, the ASX 200 stock reported a 24% increase in revenue to $334 million and a 30% lift in operating EBITDA to $177 million. This is a quicker rate of growth than the company delivered in the first half. As a result, financial year to date, revenue is now up 20% to $1,060 million and operating EBITDA is up 24% to $616 million. Commenting on the quarter, REA Group's CEO, Owen Wilson, said:   The Australian property market maintained its strong momentum during the quarter with seller confidence and healthy buyer demand driving activity. Australian consumers' preference for our premium products and our focus on customer value delivered an exceptional result in this strong market.   The ASX 200 stock advised that national listings were up 6% year on year in the third quarter thanks largely to the key Sydney and Melbourne markets. Listings in these markets were up 20% and 18%, respectively, compared to the prior corresponding period. Market leadership continues REA Group continues to be the market leader by some distance. It notes that its network of brands holds three of the top four rankings across all Australian property websites. In addition, 11.2 million people visited realestate.com.au each month on average during the quarter, with 52% exclusively using realestate.com.au. There were also 130 million average realestate.com.au monthly visits, which is 4.1 times more visits than its nearest competitor each month on average. Outlook The ASX 200 stock's CEO remains positive on the future and has reiterated its target of positive jaws (revenue growing quicker than costs) in FY 2024. Wilson concludes:   REA is well positioned for a strong finish to the financial year. The property market should continue to benefit from the belief that interest rates have reached, or are near the peak, providing buyers and sellers with confidence. We're excited by our development pipeline and look forward to delivering new products and experiences that will continue to drive growth and further enhance the value of our audience.   Broker reaction Goldman Sachs was impressed with the update, noting that it came in ahead of expectations. The broker said:   REA delivered a strong 3Q24 update, with Sales/EBITDA +24%/+24% vs. pcp and +3%/+5% vs. GSe."},

Well, with the market down in the dumps today, now could be a good time to pounce. But which ASX shares would be good options? Let's take  a look at five buy-rated stocks that brokers are tipping to generate big returns for investors. IDP Education Ltd  ( ASX: IEL ) The team at Goldman Sachs thinks that this language testing and student placement company is an ASX share to buy right now. It feels that recent weakness has created a compelling buying opportunity in a quality company that is going through a temporary headwind. Its analysts note that \"we are nearing the base for FY25E earnings and are now capitalising what we see as trough earnings/growth at a historically low multiple. IEL's structural growth outlook and business quality remain unchanged in our view.\" The broker currently has a buy rating and $25.30 price target on its shares. Lovisa Holdings Ltd  ( ASX: LOV ) Bell Potter is feeling very bullish about fashion jewellery retailer Lovisa. In fact, the broker has just lifted its valuation for the company because it believes it can grow its store network at an even quicker than expected rate. Bell Potter estimates that Lovisa can grow its network by 10% per annum between FY 2023 and FY 2034. It expects this to underpin strong earnings growth over the period. The broker has a buy rating and $36.00 price target on Lovisa's shares. Megaport Ltd  ( ASX: MP1 ) Another ASX share that has been named as a buy is Megaport. It is a leading global provider of elastic interconnection services. Macquarie is a big fan of the company and is forecasting rapid growth over the coming years. This is thanks to strong near-term operating leverage and the growth of its Megaport Cloud Router (MCR) and Megaport Virtual Edge (MVE) products. Macquarie currently has an outperform rating and $18.30 price target on Megaport's shares. Qantas Airways Limited  ( ASX: QAN ) Over at Goldman Sachs, its analysts also think that this  airline  operator's shares are great value at current levels. Especially given the way the company's post-COVID transformation has created structurally stronger earnings. Goldman has a buy rating and $8.05 price target on its shares. Xero Ltd  ( ASX: XRO ) Finally, another ASX share that Goldman Sachs is bullish on is Xero. It is a rapidly growing cloud accounting platform provider with a huge market opportunity. And when I say huge, I mean it. The broker believes Xero is \"very well-placed to take advantage of the digitisation of SMBs globally, driven by compelling efficiency benefits and regulatory tailwinds, with >100mn SMBs worldwide representing a >NZ$100bn TAM.\" Goldman has the company on its Asia-Pacific conviction list with a buy rating and $156.00 price target,"},

But today is a challenging one for  Neuren Pharmaceuticals Ltd  ( ASX: NEU ), with its share price crashing 10.6% to an intraday low of $17.97 this morning.  This followed the release of its  Q1 FY24 update on sales of its maiden drug, Daybue . The ASX 200 biotech has since retraced some of those losses. Neuren shares are changing hands for $18.97 apiece, down 5.62%, at the time of writing.  It appears investors aren't too pleased with the progress of DAYBUE sales in the US.  Let's look into the details of the update.  ASX healthcare star falls on Q1 sales update  The update issued by Neuren Pharmaceuticals today contains highlights of the Q1 FY24 earnings reported by its United States partner,  Acadia Pharmaceuticals  ( NASDAQ: ACAD ). Acadia is responsible for the global sales and commercialisation of Neuren's first approved drug, DAYBUE, which received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval last year.  DAYBUE is a world-first drug treatment for Rett syndrome. It's approved in the US for adults and pediatric patients aged two years and up.  Acadia announced that Q1 net sales of DAYBUE in the US totalled US$75.9 million. This only just missed the guidance range of US$76 million to US$82 million. Neuren anticipates it will receive royalty revenue of A$11.6 million for the quarter. It expects full-year FY24 royalties of between A$61 million and A$70 million.  That's on top of sales milestone revenue of A$77 million, assuming Acadia meets its guidance range and the US/AUD exchange rate is 65 cents.  Today's sales data for 1Q FY24 was lower than last quarter's  net sales  of US$87.1 million.  Acadia reiterated its full-year 2024 guidance for net sales of between US$370 million and US$420 million.  Why were 1Q FY24 sales lower than 4Q FY23?  Neuren has previously explained that seasonal effects negatively impacted 1Q FY24 sales.  These included refills that were due in January and actioned in December, prior to the holidays, and reduced Rett clinic days in January.  The company said discontinuations during Q1 were higher following a surge in new patient starts in the previous quarters.  Gross-to-net discounts were slightly higher in Q1, too.  Net patient additions have resumed, with increases in each of the past six weeks. The company said:    Approximately 25% of the 5,000 diagnosed Rett syndrome patients in the United States have initiated therapy.    Persistence on therapy continues to track more than 10% higher than the clinical trial experience, with 58% remaining on therapy after treatment for 9 months. 862 patients are currently on therapy.   What's next for this ASX healthcare stock? Neuren Pharmaceuticals said Acadia had made good progress on its international expansion for DAYBUE.  A New Drug Submission in Canada was accepted for filing, and priority review was granted, with potential for approval around the end of 2024. A pediatric investigation plan (PIP) was filed with and accepted by the European Medicines Agency, with a Marketing Authorisation Application anticipated in Q1 2025. A formal meeting with the Japanese regulatory agency (PMDA) to discuss the clinical plan is scheduled in Q2 2024. What's next for Neuren Pharmaceuticals? Neuren's second drug candidate, NNZ-2591, is in Phase 2 development for Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS), Angelman syndrome, Pitt-Hopkins syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome. Neuren is focused on developing new drug therapies to treat serious childhood neurological disorders  that have no or limited approved treatments available.  All of its drugs have 'orphan drug' designation for rare and serious diseases in the US, which gives Neuren access to incentives to support its work.  Typically, an orphan drug is not profitable to produce without government assistance, as the diseases they treat are rare and affect only small portions of the population.  Neuren Pharmaceuticals share price snapshot Over the past 12 months, this ASX healthcare share has risen 39.5%. Obviously, that encapsulates part of that magnificent 214% gain over the 12 months to 31 December.  But the company hit a snag in February, which impacted its share price trajectory, as shown below.  Neuren Pharmaceuticals was hit with a short seller's report on 15 February. The report described DAYBUE as a  \"flop\" amid \"horror stories\" of side effects among patients .  Neuren's  response  was not enough to stop the ASX healthcare share tumbling, and it's moved sideways ever since."},

As we can see on the chart below, the last six months has been a period of strong growth for shareholders. The owner of Bunnings, Kmart and Officeworks is benefiting from the overall economy remaining stronger than feared. Some households are doing it tough, so this is where the value on offer from the Kmart and Bunnings products can shine through. However, no ASX share is a buy at  any  price, so investors should be cautious about paying at an increasingly high price.  Time to be cautious? As the share price rises, it pushes up the  price/earnings (P/E) ratio , making it seem more expensive (if the earnings projections aren't also increasing). If we look at the projections on Commsec, Wesfarmers is projected to see profit growth in each of the next three annual results. It's predicted to grow  earnings per share (EPS)  to $2.26 in FY24, $2.44 in FY25 and $2.71 in FY26. This would put the Wesfarmers share price at 31x FY24's estimated earnings and 29x FY25's estimated earnings. This is fairly elevated considering Wesfarmers is only projected to grow its EPS by 8% in FY25 and 11% in FY26. Ideally, an attractive investment will see the P/E ratio and earnings growth at a fairly similar number. This comes at a time when the  Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)  is expecting  inflation  (and the  interest rate ) to remain elevated for a while yet. We may not have seen the last of the  volatility  of the stock market this year. Is the Wesfarmers share price still a buy? I'd be  less  excited to buy Wesfarmers shares today than in December or January 2024. However, it's important to keep in mind that this business has been generally growing for decades. And what happens in 2024 is unlikely, in my mind, to disrupt the company's long-term earnings trajectory. Wesfarmers' Kmart and Bunnings businesses have plenty of potential to keep growing, particularly if the  Australian population  keeps increasing at a good pace. More people means more potential customers and more houses required (which need construction materials). The business is growing into other sectors such as lithium and healthcare. I think healthcare is very promising for the company – not only is it a huge market, with multiple areas of growth (eg digital healthcare, and the wellness category), but Wesfarmers can bring some of its expertise and scale to its subsidiaries in the healthcare space, such as Priceline. While I wouldn't call it cheap, this is the sort of quality business that could keep growing profit for a long time to come.  I'd be happy enough to start a position today and then buy more if the Wesfarmers share price falls or if the earnings can grow to reduce the P/E ratio."},

With demand growth outpacing supply growth, the copper price has surged from US$8,197 per tonne on 15 February to US$10,030 per tonne today. As you'd expect, that's offered some heady tailwinds for miners with a strong copper focus. The  Aeris Resources Ltd  ( ASX: AIS ) share price, for example, has rocketed 189% since 15 February. And  S&P/ASX 200 Index  (ASX: XJO) copper share  Sandfire Resources Ltd  ( ASX: SFR ) is up 39% over that same period. This is a company with a  market cap  of almost $4.5 billion. The booming global demand for copper also saw now dual-listed, Canadian-based  Capstone Copper Corp  ( ASX: CSC ) begin trading on the ASX on 8 April. Since then, the ASX copper share has gained 12%. Then there's  BHP Group Ltd  ( ASX: BHP ). While iron ore brings in the biggest slice of BHP's revenue, copper comes in at number two. And BHP is actively looking to increase its copper exposure, lobbing a roughly $60 billion  takeover  bid for copper-focused  Anglo American  ( LSE: AAL ) last month. That offer was rejected by Anglo American's board. The market is now waiting to see if BHP comes back with a better offer. Why ASX copper shares are enjoying near-record prices Looming interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve, supply disruptions at various mines across the world, and strong demand growth have all worked to send the copper price — and ASX copper shares — skywards. These dynamics have seen  Goldman Sachs  boost its year-end price target for copper to US$12,000 per tonne, up from the prior forecast of US$10,000 per tonne. According to Goldman analyst Nicholas Snowdon (quoted by  Bloomberg ), \"We continue to forecast a shift into open-ended and mounting metal  deficits  from 2024 onwards.\" Snowdon noted the possibility that global inventories could dip to very low levels in the fourth quarter of 2024. AIs, EVs, and the great energy transition In late April, Nick Pashias, head of Equities and portfolio manager of Antares' High Growth Shares Fund, highlighted the range of factors driving rising global copper demand and, in turn, supporting ASX copper shares. According to Pashias:   In an era where the world is increasingly reliant on electricity, copper emerges as a critical component in meeting the surging demand.   As the backbone of power infrastructure and a key enabler of technological advancements such as EVs, AI, and data centres, copper stands at the forefront of the energy revolution.   Highly conductive copper has benefited from the rapid increase in electricity consumption. Addressing this unprecedented surge in electricity use, Pashias said:   Data centres, fuelled by the AI boom, have become the fastest-growing consumers of power. As AI applications continue to evolve, the demand for data processing and storage escalates, placing significant strain on power grids worldwide.   With data centres increasingly adopting AI technologies, the need for robust power infrastructure, including copper-based systems, becomes indispensable.   He noted that data centres currently consumed around 1% to 2% of total electricity production, with median forecasts suggesting \"data centre energy usage will grow at 11%\" every year through 2030. And this booming demand growth comes amid limited new supplies. \"Factors such as geopolitics, production halts, delays, and aging mines contribute to a tightening supply-demand imbalance, amplifying the attractiveness of copper as an investment opportunity,\" Pashias said. So, is it too late to buy ASX copper shares like Sandfire Resources? Putting the pieces together, I think not."},

At the close of trading, the  All Ordinaries Index  (ASX: XAO) had clawed back some ground to end the day 0.14% higher. But there were two  ASX gold shares  that sat out of trading this morning. Oh, and one of them clocked a 135% gain just before it was halted. But first, let's talk about  De Grey Mining Ltd  ( ASX: DEG ). This ASX gold share last traded yesterday, and its share price is currently frozen at yesterday's close of $1.26. Just before market open this morning,  De Grey revealed  it would conduct a  capital raising program  to finance its Hemi Gold Project. De Grey will raise an estimated $600 million from this capital raise. Of that figure, approximately $343.9 million will be raised from an institutional share placement, with the remaining $256.1 million coming from an entitlement offer for existing shareholders. De Grey plans to issue 545.5 million new shares to fund this program, which represents around 29.5% of the company's current share count. These new ASX gold shares will be issued at a price of $1.10 each. It will be interesting to see what the market makes of these plans when De Grey shares eventually return to trading. But let's get to the 135% share price spike. How is this ASX gold share up 300%? That's precisely what occurred with the shares of  Iceni Gold Ltd  ( ASX: ICL ) this morning. Iceni shares closed at 2.3 cents each yesterday but opened at 3.9 cents this morning before a trading halt took effect just before 11am. By that time, this ASX gold share was trading at 5.4 cents. After the shares were halted,  Iceni revealed  that the company had struck gold… literally. Iceni has made a major discovery at the gold explorer's 14 Mile Well Project in Western Australia. In a subsequent release, Iceni confirmed that fieldwork at the site had resulted in the discovery of \"multiple spectacular gold-bearing quartz veinlets\" within a small area. Iceno was able to produce a 9.5-ounce gold dore bar from just one sample at the site. Here's some of what Iceni managing director Wade Johnson had to say on this development:   The shallow excavation and sampling activities at Christmas Gift [within the 14 Mile Well Project]  exposing the rich gold-bearing quartz veinlets within the shear zone is an exciting development for the company.   The additional fieldwork has improved our knowledge of the host structure… but also provides a geological model that we can apply elsewhere in the Everleigh Well area.   The strike length of the structure is open, drill sites have been prepared and we are looking forward to commencing drilling shortly to evaluate the down dip extent of the structure and rapidly advance this priority target.   This afternoon, Iceni shares returned to trading, and investors haven't been mucking around. The company exploded to a high of 11 cents before retreating to 9.2 cents on the close of trade. That's still a whopping 300% higher than when it started the day It's a pretty good day to be an Iceni shareholder."},

Here's how much you have now!", "title_link": "https://www.fool.com.au/2024/05/09/invested-8000-in-new-hope-shares-3-years-ago-heres-how-much-you-have-now/", "published_date": "May 9, 2024", "publisher_name": "Bernd Struben", "Description": "New Hope Corp Ltd  ( ASX: NHC ) shares have handed out some very tidy gains over the past three years. How tidy? I'm glad you asked! Here's what an $8,000 investment in New Hope shares three years ago would be worth today. How have New Hope shares been tracking? Three years (and two days ago) ago, on 7 May 2021, you could have bought New Hope shares for $1.18 apiece. Meaning you could have bought 6,779 shares with your $8,000 investment. Not coincidentally, May 2021 was also when we saw coal prices begin to really lift off. At the time thermal coal, primarily used for generating electricity, was trading for approximately US$98 per tonne. But fuelled by strong demand amid limited new supplies, and following Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thermal coal prices hit all-time highs of some US$440 per tonne by September 2022. This also saw New Hope shares trading at all-time highs in October of that year. Although the ASX 200 coal stock has retreated from those record highs, investors who bought three years ago will still be sitting very pretty. New Hope shares closed yesterday trading for $4.70 apiece. That gives the  S&P/ASX 200 Index  (ASX: XJO)  coal miner  a market cap of right around $4.0 billion. And it means that the 6,779 shares you bought three years ago for $8,000 would now be worth a cool $31,861.30. But that's not the extent of the gains you would have booked. New Hope shares also have been paying out some very juicy  dividends . Don't forget the dividends New Hope shares gained a lot of attention among  passive income  investors in recent years amid the coal miner's soaring dividend payments. Since May 2021 the ASX 200 coal stock has made a total of six fully  franked  dividend payments. All told these come out to $1.80 a share in dividends that you would have received if you'd bought the stock three years ago. Now we'll assume here that you decided to spend those dividends rather than reinvest them, which could have netted you even more gains. OK. If we add the $1.80 a share in total dividend payouts to yesterday's closing price of $4.70, then the total accumulated value of New Hope shares since May 2021 works out to $6.50 a share. Which means – drum roll please – that the 6,779 shares you bought three years ago for $8,000 would be worth $44,063.50 today. Or a gain of 451%!"},

That translates to the broad market typically moving in a general state of incline over time. But share markets move in cycles, and purchase prices matter. Under this lens, a stock market  crash  – while not ideal – opens a window of buying opportunities. The great investing icon Warren Buffett says it best: \"Widespread fear is your friend as an investor because it serves up bargain purchases.\" If there were another market crash, here are three of the ASX 200 shares I would go bargain-hunting for. Wesfarmers Ltd ( ASX: WES ) Say the market were to crash, a  recession  is likely to precede or follow suit. The diversified  retail  conglomerate Wesfarmers has a competitive advantage here due to its broad offering of portfolio brands. Many of its companies are in competitive industries with low profit margins but have high market share and equally high revenues. That's because they are the low-cost provider in many instances, beating the competitors on price and operating margin – highly attractive in a high- inflation  world. Bunnings, Kmart, and Priceline Pharmacy are three cases in point here. But when times are tough, consumers also turn to low-cost providers as their preferred providers. So, if the economy is slow, Wesfarmers' competitive advantage increases. Goldman Sachs  has  tipped  Bunnings to deliver $2.5 billion to $3 billion in free  cash flow  for Wesfarmers this year, which will be used to finance its growth ventures in health and lithium. Wesfarmers touched a record trading high of $71.11 on Wednesday. Any move into the $50-$55 per share range would be an attractive entry point in my books. CSL Ltd ( ASX: CSL ) Global  biotechnology  giant CSL continues to cement its position as a market leader in various complex disease segments. The company's technologies are used in laboratories throughout the globe, and its three core units, CSL Behring blood plasma therapy, CSL Vifor iron deficiency and nephrology therapies, and Seqirus for vaccines, are here to stay. A market crash would make this ASX share really attractive to investors due to the cyclical tailwinds building in its plasma collections and immunoglobulin divisions. Research conducted by Global Market Insights  projects  the global immunoglobulin market to grow at 7.7% per year to 2030, reaching US$32 billion by then. Analysts at  UBS  agree, forecasting \"double-digit earnings growth over the coming years\" from this division, according to my Foolish colleague James  last week . UBS has a price target of $330 on the CSL share price, 20% upside potential. If the stock slipped back to $225 per share, the upside potential would increase to 46% at UBS' valuation. National Australia Bank Ltd ( ASX: NAB ) ASX  banking  shares have rallied in 2024. NAB hasn't missed the boat, up 12% in the past four months. NAB also had a  return on equity (ROE)  of 12.9% in 2023, the second highest in the banking majors. The rally has pushed NAB shares toward many  analyst  price targets. Goldman Sachs and  Morgans  value NAB at $33 and $30 apiece, respectively, whereas  Citi  analysts have a $28 valuation. Despite this, NAB has plenty going for it. It recently  announced  a number of leadership changes that caught investor attention. As I write, its dividend of $1.68 per share provides a trailing dividend yield of 4.85%, which would spike sharply in a market crash. A pullback to $25 per share, for instance, would give NAB shareholders a 6.7% yield at that dividend rate.  This characteristic is easy to ignore at the wrong price. That's why, if the market were to suddenly crash, NAB is firmly on my radar."},

This time last year, Woolworths shares were flying high above $38 each. But today, those same shares are going for just $30.96 at the time of writing, up 0.16% for the day thus far. Not only is that down 19.9% from where those shares were 12 months ago, but it also puts Woolies down around 17.5% over 2024 to date. Investors have also had to watch as Woolworths has retreated more than 26% from the company's last all-time high of roughly $42 that we saw back in mid-2021. Check that all out for yourself below: However, as all  dividend  investors know, a falling share price in addition to a stable dividend produces something rather desirable – a rising  dividend yield . Falling Woolworths shares but a rising dividend yield A company's dividend yield is a function of two metrics. The first is the raw dividends per share that a company forks out, every six months in this case. The second is the company's share price. If a company's dividend payments remain the same, but its share price drops, the dividend yield that investors enjoy on any additional share purchases rises. To illustrate, Woolworths has paid out two dividends over the past 12 months. The first was the September final dividend worth 58 cents per share. The second was the interim dividend of 47 cents per share that investors enjoyed just last month. Both of these dividends came with  full franking credits  attached. They were also both increases over the previous corresponding dividend payments. Woolworths' last 52-week high was achieved back in June last year and saw the company hit $40.35 a share. At this share price, Woolies' last two dividend payments would give the company's shares a dividend yield of 2.6%. Instead, at today's current pricing of $30.96, Woolworths is trading on a dividend yield of 3.39%. Quite an improvement, one could argue. So the sharp drop that Woolworths investors have endured over the past year or two has a clear silver lining for income investors who have enough capital to buy more shares at these reduced prices. These share price drops still haven't been enough to close the dividend yield gap that exists between Woolworths shares and those of the company's arch-rival,  Coles Group Ltd  ( ASX: COL ). Coles shares are currently trading with a dividend yield of 4.05%. But the gap is closer today than it has been for a long time."},

This is a retailer of affordable jewellery with a global store network. At the end of the  FY24 first-half  period, it had at least ten stores in the following countries: Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa, the UK, France, Germany, Belgium, Poland, USA and Canada. Store growth continues for ASX 200 stock The business has added many stores to networks in its existing countries, while also expanding into new countries. For example, in the last couple of years, it has expanded into a number of countries including Mexico, Canada, the UAE, Romania, Hungary, Spain, Botswana, Vietnam, mainland China and Taiwan. Many of these countries have much bigger populations than Australia, so there's plenty of growth potential for Lovisa's store network. Australia had 175 stores at the end of HY24, with its total network being 854 stores. With the HY24 result, Lovisa said:   With a footprint now in over 40 markets and increased support structures in place we are well placed to continue our global rollout across both existing and new markets.   The ongoing store growth is helping the ASX 200 stock's total sales. Trading in the first seven weeks of FY24 saw comparable store sales growth of 0.3% year-over-year.  Total  sales were up 19.6% year over year, thanks to those new stores. In HY24 it opened another 53 stores and in the first several weeks of the second half of FY24 it had opened another nine stores and it recently opened a new store in Dublin, Ireland. Huge profit growth expected for ASX 200 stock The broker UBS has predicted that Lovisa can deliver huge profit growth in the next few years. In  FY23 , the business generated revenue of $596 million and  earnings per share (EPS)  of $0.62. UBS suggests that Lovisa could grow its revenue by 18% to $703 million and improve EPS by 12.9% to 70 cents per share in FY24. Ongoing store growth could help the ASX 200 stock grow its EPS by 134% to $1.45 in FY28 compared to FY23, according to UBS. The broker suggests Lovisa's revenue could grow by 15.5% to $812 million in FY25 and EPS could rise by 21.4% to 85 cents. In FY26, UBS suggests Lovisa's revenue could increase by 15.1% to $935 million and EPS could rise 24.7% to $1.06. FY27 could see the revenue rise by another 15% to $1.075 billion and EPS go up 17.9% to $1.25.   FY28 could see Lovisa's revenue rise by 13.2% to $1.2 billion, while EPS could go up 16% to $1.45. Foolish takeaway There is no guarantee that Lovisa's store network growth will continue at the same growth rate as it has over the past several years.  Lovisa shares have been a strong performer – in the past five years they have risen around 220%. If the store count, revenue and profit keep rising, then Lovisa could be one to watch. However, it has risen significantly in the last six months, so it's not as cheap as it was in November. The market is expecting a lot of success from this business."},

With an investment in  Wesfarmers Ltd  ( ASX: WES ) stock, we have just that. The holding company boasts a portfolio containing some of Australia's strongest  retail ,  healthcare , and chemicals brands. These include Bunnings, Kmart/Target, Officeworks, Priceline Pharmacy, and Flybuys just to name a select few. When you own Wesfarmers stock, you own pieces of these companies, too. Wesfarmers has a long history of creating value for its shareholders. Its share price is up 81% since May 2019. A $10,000 investment back then is now worth $18,100, plus $1,667 in dividends. But what about the future? Here, I'll explain. Diversification: Good for risk and value One major reason for Wesfarmers' success is its highly diversified operations. Most people think of  diversification  as spreading their risk across a number of assets. But diversification also provides many sources of value. Wesfarmers has 37 brands operating under its wings. It has fingers in many pies. Goldman Sachs  touched on this in a recent  note , stating many Wesfarmers' divisions remained \"under-appreciated by the market\", including digital, retail media and the WES health platform. Goldman also expects a respective 6% and 11% growth in sales and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) for the Bunnings franchise in FY 2025/2026. This could generate \"strong annual free cash flow of $2.5 billion–$3 billion to fund two new high-growth and high-return platforms, Health and Lithium…\". These are two points to take note of. Speaking of Bunnings and Kmart Wesfarmers' portfolio is filled with low profit margin, high sales volume companies. They have wide consumer penetration, as a result. Goldman cited volume and consumer penetration in its view on Wesfarmers stock. It said the company had the \"largest volume of consumer data assets\", which included \"14.2 million total loyalty members across Flybuys, Priceline and PowerPass\". Both Bunnings and Kmart fit this mould, too. For instance, Bunnings made up 44% of the company's revenues in the six months to 31 December 2023 but comprised 58% of the group's EBIT. Kmart was 22% and 29%, respectively. Bunnings' H1 FY 2024 EBIT margin was 12.9%, whereas Kmart's was 10%.  But sales volume was tremendously high — $9.9 billion and $5.9 billion respectively. Both companies subsequently have stellar  returns of capital (ROC) , tallying 66% for Bunnings and 59% for Kmart. That means every $1 Wesfarmers invests into Bunnings and Kmart returns 66 and 59 cents on that dollar, respectively. This is a competitive advantage. Dividends increasing Aside from the capital appreciation, a final tailwind for Wesfarmers is the company's  dividend . The fully  franked  payment of $1.94 per share gives an ungrossed dividend yield of around 2.84%, as I write. However, it's the recent increase that's worth noting. The company's half-year sales growth was flat at 0.5%. But it grew  net profit after tax (NPAT)  by 3%. That means each $1 of new revenues brought in $6 of additional profit for the half – quite the result. The Wesfarmers board increased its dividend by 3.4% to $0.91 per share. Goldman Sachs sees this trend continuing through FY 2025/2026 as \"cost optimising and digitalisation initiatives drive margin expansion\". Foolish takeaway Wesfarmers stock has proven to be a superb long-term investment. Based on performance, I believe it can continue to beat the  S&P/ASX 200 Index  (ASX: XJO) over time. Since January this year, the Wesfarmers share price has climbed more than 20% into the green."},

Let me now demonstrate why. Buy and hold ASX shares Over the long term, the share market has delivered investors an average annual return of 10% per annum. And while there is no guarantee that it will continue doing the same in the future, we're going to assume that it does for the purpose of this article. Based on that return, if you are able to invest $10,000 into ASX shares each year and earned the market return, you would grow your portfolio to $175,000 after 10 years thanks to the power of  compounding . But why stop there? Compounding really starts to work its magic the longer you leave it. So, if we fast forward another 10 years of doing the same, your portfolio would have become worth almost $650,000. But which ASX shares would be good options for a buy and hold investment? Three to consider are as follows: CSL Ltd  ( ASX: CSL ) The first ASX share that could be a great buy and hold option is CSL. It is the  biotechnology  giant behind the CSL Behring, CSL Vifor, and CSL Seqirus businesses. These are leaders in their respective fields and provide world-class plasma therapies, iron deficiency and nephrology treatments, and vaccines. UBS thinks investors should be buying its shares at present. The broker currently has a buy rating and $330.00 price target on CSL's shares. Nextdc Ltd ( ASX: NXT ) Another ASX share that could be a great long term option for investors right now is NextDC. It is a leading data centre operator with world class operations across the Asia Pacific. Thanks to the shift to the cloud and the artificial intelligence boom, demand for data centre capacity is growing rapidly. This has many analysts predicting that NextDC will grow its earnings very strongly over the next decade. One of those is Morgans, which has an add rating and $19.00 price target on its shares. Pro Medicus Limited ( ASX: PME ) Finally, this health imaging technology company could be a quality option for investors. It is a leading provider of radiology information systems (RIS), Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS), and advanced visualisation solutions across the globe. Goldman Sachs is very bullish on the company's long term outlook. So much so, it recently put a buy rating and $134.00 price target on its shares."},

Especially if you're just wanting to take a set and forget or buy and hold approach to investing. This is because ASX ETFs allow investors to buy large groups of companies in one fell swoop. This means you don't have to pick individual stocks to buy, nor do you really need to keep a close eye on the companies you're invested in. You can just put your money to work and watch your investments grow. But which ASX ETFs could be quality options for investors looking to make buy and hold investments? Let's take a look at two: BetaShares NASDAQ 100 ETF  ( ASX: NDQ ) When investing for the long term, it is never a bad idea to invest in the highest quality companies the world has to offer. The  BetaShares NASDAQ 100 ETF  certainly ticks this box. It provides investors with access to 100 of the largest non-financial companies on the famous NASDAQ index. These are the giants of Wall Street (and the world) and include iPhone maker  Apple  ( NASDAQ: AAPL ), Facebook and Instagram owner  Meta  ( NASDAQ: META ), software giant  Microsoft  ( NASDAQ: MSFT ), graphics card behemoth  Nvidia  ( NASDAQ: NVDA ), and electric vehicle leader  Tesla  ( NASDAQ: TSLA ). Over the last 10 years, the index this ETF tracks has delivered investors a stunning average total return of 22.25% per annum. This would have turned a $10,000 investment into almost $75,000. VanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat ETF  ( ASX: MOAT ) Another ASX ETF that could be a great buy and hold option is the  VanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat ETF . This fund has a focus on companies that are deemed to have sustainable competitive advantages ( wide moats ) and fair valuations. These are the qualities that the king of buy and hold investing, Warren Buffett, looks for when he is making investments for  Berkshire Hathaway  ( NYSE: BRK.B ). And given how the Oracle of Omaha has consistently outperformed the market since all the way back in 1965, I think it is fair to say that a focus on companies with wide moats and fair valuations has its merits. The companies that the fund invests in will change periodically. But at present it includes tobacco giant  Altria Group Inc  ( NYSE: MO ), food company  Campbell Soup  ( NYSE: CPB ), beauty products company  Estee Lauder  ( NYSE: EL ), sportswear leader  Nike  ( NYSE: NKE ), and entertainment juggernaut  Walt Disney  ( NYSE: DIS ). Over the past 10 years, the index the fund tracks has generated an average total return of 17.1% per annum. This would have turned a $10,000 investment into over $48,000."},

Here are five things to watch: ASX 200 expected to fall The Australian share market looks set for a subdued session on Thursday following a mixed night on Wall Street. According to the latest SPI futures, the ASX 200 is expected to open the day 16 points or 0.2% lower this morning. In the United States, the Dow Jones was up 0.45%, but the S&P 500 was flat and the Nasdaq fell 0.2%. Oil prices rise ASX 200 energy shares including  Beach Energy Ltd  ( ASX: BPT ) and  Woodside Energy Group Ltd  ( ASX: WDS ) could have a good session after oil prices charged higher overnight.  According to Bloomberg , the WTI crude oil price is up 1.1% to US$79.22 a barrel and the Brent crude oil price is up 0.7% to US$83.77 a barrel. This was driven by a surprise stockpile decline in the United States. CBA Q3 update The  Commonwealth Bank of Australia  ( ASX: CBA ) share price will be on watch on Thursday when the banking giant releases its third quarter update. One area of focus for investors will be productivity. Goldman Sachs recently commented: \"In light of the soft revenue growth environment, it has become increasingly important for the sector to take a more proactive approach in cost management. Adding to this challenge has been stickier than expected inflation which was a headwind to costs in FY23 with its impact broadly based across i) staff, ii) third party, iii) and investment spend. Overall we are of the view the key to offsetting these inflationary pressures will be the banks' ability to deliver productivity improvements.\" Gold price softens It looks set to be a subdued day for ASX 200 gold shares  Newmont Corporation  ( ASX: NEM ) and  Northern Star Resources Ltd  ( ASX: NST ) after the gold price softened overnight. According to CNBC, the  spot gold price  is down 0.3% to US$2,316.4 an ounce. The precious metal appears to be in a holding pattern while waiting for rate cut clues. Westpac goes ex-dividend Westpac Banking Corp  ( ASX: WBC ) shares are going ex-dividend on Thursday and look likely to drop into the red. Earlier this week, Australia's oldest bank released its half year results and posted a 4% year on year decline in net operating income to $10,590 million. However, this couldn't stop the bank from increasing its fully franked interim dividend by 7.1% to 75 cents per share and declaring a special fully franked 15 cents per share dividend. These dividends will be paid to eligible shareholders on 25 June."},

The  ASX bank share sector  collectively has quite a high  dividend payout ratio , which pushes up the  dividend yield . The other side to the equation is having a reasonable  price/earnings (P/E) ratio . The NAB share price has risen strongly over the past year, as we can see in the chart below. After the bank's recent release of the  FY24 first-half result , let's consider how big the dividend payouts might be in the future. HY24 payout recap NAB reported that its cash earnings of $3.55 billion for the six months to 31 March 2024 were down 12.8% year over year and down 3.1% half-on-half. However, the diluted cash  earnings per share (EPS)  of $1.12 didn't drop as much – it fell 1.6% half-on-half and 12.3% year on year. NAB decided to grow its interim dividend per share by 1.2% year over year to 84 cents per share. This was the same dividend as the FY23 second-half dividend. It represents a cash dividend payout ratio of 75%, which is generous and leaves some profit within the business for more growth. That means the business currently has a fully franked dividend yield of around 5% and a grossed-up dividend yield of approximately 7%. How much passive income would 200 NAB shares pay? If NAB were to repeat the last two declared dividends as the next two dividends, it would be an annual payout of $1.68. Owning 200 NAB shares would mean receiving $336 of cash and $480 of grossed-up dividends if we include the  franking credits . But that's assuming the dividends don't change in the coming years. Some analysts think the NAB dividend may grow in the next few years. The estimate on Commsec suggests the bank could pay a passive income of $1.70 per share in FY25 and $1.71 per share in FY26. That means that if an investor owned 200 NAB shares, it could pay $340 in cash dividends and $486 in grossed-up dividends, with the franking credits as a bonus. Outlook for NAB shares  The NAB dividend could be heavily influenced by how the economy performs for the foreseeable future. NAB had this to say regarding the economic outlook:   In Australia, household consumption growth slowed sharply in the second half of 2023, impacted by interest rates and cost of living pressures. This is weighing on real GDP growth which is expected to remain below-trend over the near term.    However, some relief is anticipated later this year with expected tax cuts and a forecast easing in monetary policy from November should inflation continue to moderate. Following 1.5% GDP growth over 2023, growth of 1.7% is forecast over 2024, before improving to around 2.25 % in 2025.    Pressure has eased in the labour market and wage growth is expected to slow from elevated rates in 2023. The unemployment rate is expected to continue to drift higher, peaking at around 4.5% by end 2024, but most indicators of labour demand remain healthy suggesting employment will continue to grow."},

No old saying will prevent me from pulling the trigger on buying if there are looming opportunities in the market.  The fight against  inflation  waged by the Reserve Bank of Australia continues to threaten a 'genuine' recession. Warren Buffett recently said the investment landscape isn't 'attractive'. And I haven't purchased any individual shares since February… that's bearish, right?  I don't think so.  It might mean those no-brainer buys are harder to find, but I reckon a keen-eyed investor can spot a beauty even now.  Why buy ASX dividend shares? I try not to place  too  much emphasis on income in my  portfolio . While still in my younger years, my goal is to maximise wealth growth. Hence, I'm not looking for companies with the highest dividend yield, trying to squeeze out every last dollar I can to fund my next year of activities.  However, if I can find a great quality company that just happens to pay  dividends … That's the investing equivalent of finding loose chips in the bottom of the Maccas bag after devouring your fries. You weren't expecting it, but you're glad to see them.  After a while, those dividends add up. I've purchased other ASX shares with money solely sourced from dividends. It feels like I've stumbled upon some sort of money glitch. Whatever 'math' you want to call it, investments funded by income from  ASX dividend shares  are pretty magical.  I've prattled on long enough. Here's what I'm buying this month. My bottom drawer buy It mightn't be a dividend aristocrat, but it's close enough for me.  Sonic Healthcare Ltd  ( ASX: SHL ) has steadily grown its dividends for 30 years. That's worthy of some sort of term. Maybe dividend stalwart is fitting.  The laboratory, pathology, and radiology services provider is a cornerstone of healthcare systems worldwide. However, investors have sold down the stock by more than 40% from its all-time high as COVID testing revenues have evaporated.  In my view, the market is overlooking the quality of Sonic's base business. Pathology and laboratory testing is a difficult industry to crack. The value typically accrues to the players with the greatest scale — that's what Sonic Healthcare is in multiple markets.  Due to the sell-off, this ASX dividend share is currently trading on a  dividend yield  of 4%. Pouncing on the pullback  Macquarie Group Ltd  ( ASX: MQG ) posted a lacklustre  full-year result  last week. Net profit for the 12-month period was down 32% versus the prior year, prompting the financial dynamo to dial back its final dividend by 14.4% to $3.85 per share.  The Macquarie share price is now roughly 5% below its 52-week high. At first glance, the result appears worthy of selling. But let's not be hasty.  I believe Macquarie will still be a frontrunner in the long term. The company houses an immense array of expertise in funding and managing infrastructure. Such skills could be in high demand over the coming decades.  This ASX dividend share is yielding 3.4%."},

Especially given its attractive valuation and strong earnings per share growth outlook. It said:   While shares have struggled of late, we continue to view CSL as a key portfolio holding and sector pick, offering double-digit recovery in earnings growth as plasma collections increase, new products get approved and influenza vaccine uptake increases around ongoing concerns about respiratory viruses, with shares trading at 25x, a substantial discount (20%) to its long-term average.   The broker has an add rating and $315.35 price target on CSL's shares. ResMed Inc.  ( ASX: RMD ) Another ASX 200 share that Morgans is tipping as a strong buy is sleep disorder treatment company ResMed. Its analysts feel that concerns over weight loss drugs disrupting its market are unwarranted. As a result, it believe ResMed's long-term growth outlook remains very positive. It said:   While weight loss drugs have grabbed headlines and investor attention, we see these products having little impact on the large, underserved sleep disorder breathing market, and do not view them as category killers. Although quarters are likely to remain volatile, nothing changes our view that the company remains well placed and uniquely positioned as it builds a patient-centric, connected-care digital platform that addresses the main pinch points across the healthcare value chain.   The broker has an add rating and $34.11 price target on its shares. Washington H Soul Pattinson & Company Ltd  ( ASX: SOL ) A third ASX 200 share that is on Morgans' best ideas list this month is investment house Soul Patts. The broker likes the company due to its positive long term track record and diversified business. It explains:   SOL's investment portfolio includes a diversified pool of assets ranging from listed equities (both large cap and emerging companies), private equity, property and structured yield. On a 20-year horizon, SOL's annualised TSR is 12.5% vs the All Ords accumulation index of 9%. SOL has a 20-year history of increased dividend distributions, with a 20-year CAGR of c.8%. In our view, SOL's management team continues to deliver both organic and inorganic growth over the long term. We continue to like the SOL story, particularly its track record of growing distributions.   Morgans has an add rating and $35.60 price target on the company's shares."},

But which ASX dividend stocks could be quality options for an income portfolio right now? Well, listed below are two stocks that have recently been named as buys by analysts. In addition, they have been tipped to provide investors with  dividend yields  of at least 5.5% in FY 2024 and FY 2025. Let's now take a look at why analysts are bullish and what they are saying about these stocks: Accent Group Ltd ( ASX: AX1 ) The first ASX dividend stock for investors to look at according to analysts at Bell Potter is Accent Group. It is a footwear focused retailer that operates over 800 stores (and numerous online stores) across brands including HypeDC, Sneaker Lab, Platypus, Stylerunner, and The Athlete's Foot. Following a review of the retail sector this week, the broker remains very positive on Accent Group. It said: \"Our revenue assumptions for Accent Group (AX1) see improving comps towards the end of the 2H and we remain positive on recovering trends with positive commentary from global footwear brands such as Skechers & Deckers (Hoka). We also focus on incremental benefits to AX1's younger customer demographics who we think could benefit from the upcoming tax cuts.\" Bell Potter expects this to underpin fully franked dividends per share of 13 cents in FY 2024 and then 14.6 cents in FY 2025. Based on the latest Accent share price of $1.83, this represents dividend yields of 7.1% and 8%, respectively. The broker currently has a buy rating and $2.50 price target on its shares. Dexus Industria REIT ( ASX: DXI ) Another ASX dividend stock that could be a buy is Dexus Industria. It is a real estate investment trust that primarily invests in high quality industrial warehouses located across capital cities such as Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide. Morgans is positive on the company. It notes that \"DXI's industrial portfolio remains robust with the outlook positive for rental growth. The development pipeline also provides near and medium-term upside potential and post asset sales there is balance sheet capacity to execute.\" The broker currently has an add rating and $3.18 price target on its shares. In respect to dividends, Morgans expects dividends per share of 16.4 cents in FY 2024 and 16.6 cents in FY 2025. Based on the current Dexus Industria share price of $2.97, this will mean dividend yields of 5.5% and 5.6%, respectively."},

That's because the  banking  giant has just released its third  quarter update . Let's see what the bank reported for the three months ended 31 March. CBA share price on watch following Q3 update   Operating income down 1%   Operating expenses up 2%   Unaudited statutory net profit after tax down 5% to $2.4 billion   CET1 ratio of 11.9%   What happened during the quarter? For the three months ended 31 March, CBA reported a 1% decline in operating income. This reflects one less day in the quarter and slightly lower net interest margins. The latter was driven primarily by continued competitive pressures and customers switching to higher yielding deposits. This was largely offset by higher earnings on replicating portfolio and equity hedges. CBA's expenses increased 2% due to higher amortisation and staff costs, which were partially offset by productivity initiatives. This ultimately led to Australia's largest bank reporting an unaudited statutory net profit after tax of $2.4 billion for the three months. This is down 3% on the first half average and 5% on the prior corresponding period. What else did CBA report? CBA reported improved momentum in volume growth. This was delivered across home lending and household deposits in the quarter. It advised that in the Retail Bank, transaction accounts continued to grow with an increase of ~143,000 accounts in the quarter. This was mainly driven by new migrant account openings. Home loans grew $4.2 billion during the quarter. However, this was at 0.7x system for the three months. Its proprietary mix for home loans represented 65% of new business flows for the quarter. Household deposits grew $5.3 billion in the quarter. CBA has been working hard on its business banking operations. It advised that it has continued to build its Business Banking franchise through deep transaction banking relationships. Business transaction accounts increased by ~25,000 in the quarter to over 1.22 million accounts. This is up 10% on the prior comparative period. Business lending volumes grew above system at 1.1x for the three months, with diversified growth across multiple sectors. Rising arrears Finally, the bank's balance sheet remains strong despite an increase in arrears. It reported a loan impairment expense of $191 million for the quarter, or 8 basis points of average Gross Loans and Acceptances (GLAA). Home loan arrears increased during the quarter to 0.61% (+9 basis points), as higher interest rates continue to impact some borrowers. Credit card arrears increased during the quarter (+8 basis points) in line with seasonal trends. Personal loan arrears increased (+20 basis points) during the quarter, with elevated arrears observed for customers more susceptible to cost of living pressures. Management warned that it expects to see further increases in arrears in the months ahead given continued pressure on real household disposable incomes. Nevertheless, CBA finished the period with a healthy customer deposit funding ratio of 75%, LCR of 138%, and NSFR of 120%."},

If I were investing $500 today, I'd want to choose stocks that can grow earnings significantly but aren't priced exorbitantly.  There are plenty of great businesses on the ASX, such as  WiseTech Global Ltd  ( ASX: WTC ),  Pro Medicus Ltd  ( ASX: PME ) and  REA Group Limited  ( ASX: REA ). However, these stocks certainly come with hefty  price/earnings (P/E) ratio  price tags. There are a few different factors I'd want to identify with a compelling ASX growth share. ASX growth share characteristics I look for One of the first things I'm looking for is that the business has a solid core offering that seems relatively insulated from technological change and competition – some industries are changing (and being challenged) very quickly. Next, ideally, I want to see that the ASX growth share has in-built operating leverage, meaning as the business becomes bigger, profit margins grow enabling  net profit after tax (NPAT)  to rise faster than revenue. Why is that important? Profit is usually what investors use to value a business, and profit pays for  dividends . Accelerating profit should mean good shareholder returns over time.   Global growth is a key factor that I like to look for. Australia is a great country, but the relatively small population means the growth ceiling can be reached fairly quickly. Tapping into the North American, Europe or Asia markets can be very lucrative for an ASX company. Finally, I'd want to invest in a business that is reasonably priced, thinking about the potential profit it may generate in the next two to three years. Where I'd invest $500   right now I'll talk about my latest ASX growth share investment, seeing as I made it just a few days ago. Collins Foods Ltd  ( ASX: CKF ) operates KFC outlets in Australia, the Netherlands and Germany. It's also responsible for Taco Bells in Australia. I think KFC has a strong brand, and I can't see food as we know it being replaced any time soon. It's displaying excellent operating leverage at the moment. In the  FY24 first-half result , Collins Foods reported revenue rose 14.3%, underlying  earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)  increased 16.7% and underlying net profit went up 28.7%. That's exactly the sort of profit margin improvement I like to see. There is plenty of room for Collins Foods to grow its KFC and Taco Bell networks in Australia, and the potential growth in Germany and the Netherlands is very compelling to me. It opened four new KFC locations in Australia in HY24 and eight in the Netherlands. According to the estimates on Commsec, Collins Foods shares are valued at 18x FY24's estimated earnings. It is then projected to grow  earnings per share (EPS)  by 44% to 74.8 cents, which puts it at just 13x FY26's estimated earnings.  Collins Foods isn't the only  S&P/ASX 200 Index  (ASX: XJO) share that I've invested in recently. I've also written about  Corporate Travel Management Ltd  ( ASX: CTD )  here  and  Johns Lyng Group Ltd  ( ASX: JLG )  here  as other ideas."},

ASX 300 retail share slides on results The Temple & Webster share price is down 3.0% to $12.24 after the ASX 300 retail share released a trading  update  ahead of its presentation at the Macquarie Conference. Still, shares remain up a whopping 93% over the past six months. Shares are sliding despite Temple & Webster reporting that the first half-year sales were strong, with sales from 1 January to 5 May up 30% compared to the prior corresponding period. The company said sales growth is being driven by both repeat and first-time customers. And Temple & Webster is harnessing artificial intelligence to drive growth and improve customer experience. \"Our suite of internal AI solutions are delivering, in aggregate, conversion rate increases of over 10% and are now handling ~40% of all customer interactions,\" the company stated. The ASX 300 retail share also reaffirmed its full-year earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation ( EBITDA ) guidance range. \"We reiterate our EBITDA guidance of 1-3%, targeting the mid-point of the range as we continue to invest in growing our market share and delivering on our key growth pillars,\" CEO, Mark Coulter, said. \"While the overall furniture and homewares market is down 4% HTD [1 January to 5 May] due to cost-of-living pressures, our strong growth highlights the significant market share gains we are making,\" Coulter added. As for the balance sheet, the ASX 300 retail share is holding more than $100 million in cash with no debt. Temple & Webster reports its full-year results in August. JB Hi-Fi share price dives on slowing growth The JB Hi-Fi share price is also under selling pressure this morning, down 5.5% to $56.65 after the electronics retailer released a sales  update  for the period from 1 January to 31 March (Q3 FY 2024). The JB Hi-Fi share price remains up 22% over the past six months. The ASX 300 retail share reported a 0.3% year on year decline in same-store sales growth for its JB Hi-Fi Australia business. The JB Hi-Fi New Zealand business, on the other hand, enjoyed a 2.9% increase. Comparable sales growth at The Good Guys dipped 0.8% from the prior corresponding period. For the first three quarters of FY 2024, JB Hi-Fi sales growth in both Australia and New Zealand was flat. Sales growth at The Good Guy sales declined by 7.3%. Commenting on the results pressuring the ASX 300 retail share today, CEO Terry Smart said, \"We are pleased with our Q3 FY24 sales results. Our trusted value-based offerings and high levels of customer service continue to resonate with our customers.\""},

That's the view of analysts at Bell Potter, which believe the ASX  biotech stock  could be a great option for investors with a high tolerance for risk. What is Paradigm Biopharmaceuticals? Paradigm Biopharmaceuticals is a biotechnology company focused on repurposing Pentosan Polysulfate Sodium (PPS) for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) in the knee. Bell Potter believes that the global market for a safe, effective treatment that provides superior patient outcomes compared to the standard of care is a \"multiple blockbuster.\" In fact, it has suggested that market estimates of US$10 billion in annual revenues are likely conservative. The good news is that the company's recently completed phase II study produced some highly encouraging results, which are worthy of further clinical trials. What is the broker saying about this ASX biotech stock? Bell Potter notes that the coming weeks will be pivotal for this ASX biotech stock. This is because it is expecting to receive feedback from the US FDA in relation to its pathway for its treatment. It said:   PAR has a major short term catalyst within weeks being FDA feedback from its recent meeting to discuss the pathway for iPPS. A key discussion point was the design of the proposed phase 3 and confirmatory study for iPPS in osteoarthritis (OA) including the minimal effective dose (2mg twice weekly for 6 weeks). Recent studies in lower doses proved ineffective in the management of pain, hence there is no alternative to this optimal dose. Other than efficacy, the key considerations are toxicity and safety.   The data from several hundred patients treated in various clinical studies, the Special Access Scheme in Australia and non-clinical studies has shown iPPS at the optimal dose to be exceptionally safe with no serious adverse events. Accordingly, we are confident the FDA will approve the minimal effective dose and the proposed trial design.   In light of the above, this morning the broker has reaffirmed its speculative buy rating on the company's shares with a 47 cents price target. Based on its current share price, this implies over 80% upside for investors over the next 12 months. Though, it is worth remembering that Bell Potter's speculative rating means this is a high risk play. So, investors with a low or normal risk tolerance may want to stay well clear of the ASX biotech stock and focus on more appropriate investment options."},

In morning trade, the ASX All Ords stock was down as much as 20% at one stage. The baby products retailer's shares have recovered a touch since then but remain down 17% at the time of writing. Why is this ASX All Ords stock crashing today? Investors have been flooding to the exits today after the company released a disappointing  trading update. According to the release, the trend of improving comparable store sales that was seen in the first half has softened over the last two months. Management believes this reflects the ongoing cost-of-living pressures being experienced by new parents with young families. Baby Bunting advised that through March and April, investments were made in price which fell short of expectations in terms of sales and performance. This ultimately has led to its gross margin year-to-date easing to 36.9%. This is down from 37.2% during the first half. On the bottom line, the company's FY 2024 pro forma net profit after tax is now expected to be in the range of just $2 million to $4 million. This includes a loss of approximately $1.2 million associated with the extended closure and remediation of the Cairns store. This will be a sizeable decline on FY 2023's net profit after tax of $14.5 million, which itself was down 51% on FY 2022's numbers. Commenting on the underperformance, the ASX All Ords stock's CEO, Mark Teperson, said:   Baby Bunting remains focused on providing great value to customers. We're acutely aware that our customers are more sensitive than many other groups to the widespread cost-of-living pressures and are managing their spending carefully.   While we have seen an improving trend in transactions in 2H compared to 1H, this was heavily impacted by a declining average transaction value driven by consumers trading down and ongoing competition in nursery essentials impacting market price.   What's next? The company advised that the second half remains a transition period as it builds toward FY 2025. All stores are now enabled for online fulfilment, which has delivered lower freight costs (due to fewer split orders), better utilisation of inventory, and lower pick costs through April. In addition, its revised go-to-market promotional strategy is showing positive trends in active customers and transaction volumes. Teperson concludes:   Our focus on customer experience and simplification of the business continues. We continue to look for opportunities to align the cost profile with the Group's sales trajectory and future growth plans.   In late June, the ASX All Ords stock plans to provide a further update on FY 2024 trading, its initiatives into FY 2025, and its strategy for the year ahead and beyond."},

Super Retail was presenting at the  Macquarie Australia conference  today, which included its  sales update  and details of the group's 2024 enterprise agreement. Sales update The business reported a few different sales statistics. For the second half of FY24, like-for-like (LFL) sales growth for weeks 27 to 43 showed:   Supercheap Auto LFL sales rose 1%   Rebel LFL sales fell 2%   BCF LFL sales declined 5%   Macpac LFL sales increased 3%   Overall group LFL sales dropped 1%   Super Retail also reported total sales growth for weeks 1 to 43 (FY24 year to date):   Supercheap Auto sales increased 3%   Rebels sales fell 2%   BCF sales grew 5%   Macpac sales went up 2%   Total group sales rose 2%   The retailer's total group sales across March and April were approximately 1% higher than the prior corresponding period. Supercheap Auto benefited from strong demand in auto maintenance categories, including lubricants, power and car detailing. Rebel footwear sales improved thanks to the introduction of new and expanded brand ranges (including Hoka and On), though apparel demand remains \"subdued\". BCF's LFL sales reflected \"softer trading in the key Easter period and the cycling of clearance activity\" in the prior corresponding period. Macpac's sales growth was driven by a \"strong performance\" in New Zealand as inbound travel boosted sales in key tourist destination stores. It also revealed the group  gross profit margin  is \"in line\" with the prior corresponding period. The business has opened 20 stores and closed four in FY24 so far. It expects to open another seven stores before the end of FY24. 2024 enterprise agreement Super Retail said its 2024 retail and CCC Enterprise Agreement (EA) has been endorsed by its Australian team members and approved by the Fair Work Commission (FWC). The EA covers a three-year term, starting from 14 July 2024. The new EA will see all wages-paid team members across the group's Australian retail stores receive higher penalty rates and an increase in base pay rates to the tune of a 5.25% increase in FY25, 3.25% in FY26 and 3.25% in FY27. The EA applies to the store wages component of the group's employee expenses (not support office employee expenses) and excludes retail management. Prior to the EA, on 2 July 2023, the group increased retail team member base pay rates by 3%. Eligible team members will also receive a one-off payment equivalent to 2.75% of their annual base pay, with this to be paid before the end of FY24. Management comments Super Retail managing director and CEO Anthony Heraghty said:   Given current challenges around inflation and interest rates, our customers are managing their spending carefully and becoming increasingly value focused.   While store foot traffic and transaction volumes continue to grow, ongoing cost of living pressure is impacting number of items per sale.

Since early March, the airline operator's shares have ascended by an impressive 24%. This leaves them trading above the $6.00 mark for the first time this year. Does this make its shares expensive? Or can they keep climbing? Let's see what analysts are saying. Are Qantas shares too expensive? The good news for investors is that you may not be too late to the Qantas party. In fact, if one leading broker is on the money with its recommendation, there could be even larger gains to come for investors buying at today's price. According to a recent note out of Goldman Sachs, its analysts have retained their buy rating and $8.05 price target on the airline operator's shares. Based on the current Qantas share price of $6.21, this implies potential upside of 30% for investors over the next 12 months. And while the broker is not expecting any dividends this year, they could be on the horizon. The broker is forecasting a 30 cents per share dividend in FY 2025. This represents a very attractive 4.8% dividend yield. Why is it bullish? Goldman believes the market is undervaluing the company based on its improved earnings capacity following the transformation of its business following the COVID crisis. Despite these improvements, the company's valuation remains below pre-COVID times. It explains: \n Qantas Airways is the flagship carrier of Australia and is the largest airline in Australia by capacity share, serving destinations domestically and internationally. As a key beneficiary of the re-opening of the world post-COVID, we expect the airline's traffic capacity to return to 95% of pre-COVID levels by FY24e, with the airline's earnings capacity (EPS) expected to exceed that of pre-COVID levels by ~52%. We forecast a ~24% FY19-24e cumulative uplift in unit revenues (c. 4.4%pa), and ~50% drop-through of QAN's A$1bn+ structural cost-out program. QAN's current market capitalisation and enterprise value are 10% below and 11% below pre-COVID levels. \n Goldman then adds: \n As such, we believe QAN is not priced for a generic recovery, let alone prospects for improved earnings capacity. We continue to see upside associated with substantially improved MT earnings capacity. \n Overall, this could make Qantas shares a good option if you're looking for exposure to the travel sector."},

Following a correction in global markets these past few weeks, plenty of \"quality merchandise\" now presents itself. I have one ASX 300 stock in laser focus. Coal player  Yancoal Australia Ltd  ( ASX: YAL ) is my top ASX 300 stock pick for May. It's been in the green lately, but at today's share price of $5.91 apiece, the miner is still trading 14.5% lower than its all-time high of $6.91 in September 2022. This suggests there could still be plenty of value for investors. Here, I'll run through three tailwinds behind this  ASX coal miner . Strong demand for coal Global coal demand is projected to grow from 2024 as major importers India and China extend their economic growth. According to  Trading Economics,  China has announced plans to build an additional 70 gigawatts in coal capacity this year. It also built 47 gigawatts into its system last year. For context, Australia generated 30.2 gigawatts of power in 2021, says  the Department of Energy . These policies spurred Trading Economics to forecast a coal price of $147 USD/metric tonne by FY 2025, 8% above the $136 USD/MT it trades now. India also  imported  25% more coal in 2023 vs 2022, tallying 1.23 billion tonnes by yearend. Around $495 million of this tonnage is set to be imported this year. Subsequently,  S&P Global  has raised its outlook on coal pricing \"as demand for Newcastle Australia thermal coal appears to be strengthening\". It expects demand from India to \"pick up\" and that China imports will spike \"while there are tightened safety inspections in its main coal mining provinces\". All of this is excellent for Yancoal's sales and earnings growth. Attractive dividend yield If this ASX 300 stock were to pay its last annual dividend at the recent price of $5.70 a share, investors would receive a 12.2% yield. This mammoth cash return is due to the record thermal coal prices seen throughout 2022 and 2023. The company passed these through as dividends to its shareholders. However, this latest dividend is not out of sync with the last three to four years of payments. If coal prices remain as high as they are tipped to, it's not unreasonable to expect a similar rate of dividends from Yancoal moving forward. Commodity stocks are relatively 'cheap ' According to recent  analysis  by Crescat Capital macro strategist Tavi Costa, the \"commodity-to-equity\" ratio \"remains at near historical lows\". This measures the value of the GSCI Commodity Index against the value of the MSCI World Equity Index. Because of this, Costa believes we are \"still in the very early stages\" of a commodity cycle, the kinds of which \"often evolve over long-term trends\". \"Conventional investment strategies are poised to undergo a significant restructuring, placing a prominent emphasis on investments in hard assets\", Costa added. And by hard assets, he means mining. Yancoal is indeed cheap by relative standards. It trades at a  price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)  of 4.16 times, meaning investors are paying $4.16 for every $1 of the company's earnings. In contrast, the P/E of the  iShares Core S&P/ASX 200 ETF  ( ASX: IOZ ) is 17.3 times at the time of writing. If the S&P/ASX 200 is the benchmark, there could be relative value on the table. On the one hand, you might pay 17.3 times P/E for the S&P/ASX 200 ETF to obtain a 3.6% yield, where \"consensus is that ASX 200 earnings will drop by 3.7%\" this year, according to the  Australian Financial Review. Or you could pay the 4.16 times P/E into a rising coal price for a likely greater than 12.2% dividend yield, given Yancoal's payout history and current share price. Interesting."},

The benchmark index is currently down a fraction to 7,792.3 points. Four ASX shares that are not letting that hold them back are listed below. Here's why they are rising: Flight Centre Travel Group Ltd  ( ASX: FLT ) The Flight Centre share price is up 1.5% to $20.86. This follows the release of a  trading update  this morning. The travel agent revealed that it expects to deliver record sales in FY 2024. Flight Centre CFO, Adam Campbell, advised that the company is on track to exceed the previous record total transaction value (TTV) of $23.7 billion it achieved in FY 2019. In addition, the company reaffirmed its profit guidance for the year. This will mean profit before tax (PBT) in the range of $300 million to $340 million for FY 2024. This is approximately triple FY 2023's PBT of $106 million. Nine Entertainment Co Holdings Ltd  ( ASX: NEC ) The Nine Entertainment share price is up over 1% to $1.51. This has also been driven by the release of a trading update. The entertainment and media company revealed solid performances across its businesses in FY 2024. This includes its Stan streaming service, which management \"continues to expect growth in both revenue and EBITDA in FY24.\" In addition, Nine's Publishing business continues to benefit from the growth of digital audiences. This is expected to underpin digital subscription revenue growth in the low double digits in the second half. Polynovo Ltd  ( ASX: PNV ) The Polynovo share price is up 7% to $2.27. Investors have been buying this medical device company's shares following the release of a  sales update . Polynovo advised that it had a record month of revenue in April thanks to strong growth across the business. The star of the show was its US business, which recorded monthly sales of A$6.9 million. This was an increase of 75% on the prior corresponding period. This ultimately led to Polynovo achieving record monthly group revenue of A$10.1 million, which represents a 68.6% increase on the same period last year. QANTM Intellectual Property Ltd  ( ASX: QIP ) The QANTM share price is up 6.5% to $1.79. This has been driven by news that QANTM has received a  takeover approach  from rival  IPH Ltd  ( ASX: IPH ). It has made an unsolicited non-binding indicative proposal of 0.291 IPH shares and a fully franked special dividend of up to $0.11 cash per share. This implies an offer of $1.90 per share. This is a premium to another non-binding indicative offer that was tabled by Adamantem Capital. It offered to acquire QANTM for $1.817 per share by way of a scheme of arrangement."},

Shares in ASX 200 4×4 accessories manufacturer  ARB Corp Ltd  ( ASX: ARB ) closed yesterday trading for $38.66. In earlier trade today shares were trading for $39.78, up 2.9%. The ARB share price has since given back some of those gains, currently up 1.2% at $39.11 a share. The other stock enjoying a strong run on Wednesday is specialist insurance provider  AUB Group Ltd  ( ASX: AUB ). The AUB share price closed yesterday at $29.36. At the time of writing, shares are up 2.3%, swapping hands for $30.04 apiece. Here's what's stoking investor interest in these ASX 200 shares today. What's lifting the AUB share price? The AUB share price is leaping higher today after the company provided some promising profit  guidance . The ASX 200 share said that due to favourable trading momentum, it expects FY 2024 underlying net profit after tax (NPAT) to come in near the top end of its previously forecast range of 161 million to 171 million. Among the assumptions backing this guidance is that interest rates will remain unchanged over the period in its key operating jurisdictions. The company's group of retail and wholesale insurance brokers and underwriting agencies operate in around 570 locations globally. The AUB share price is up 13% over 12 months. ASX 200 share at  Macquarie Conference presentation As for ARB, the ASX 200 share looks to be getting a lift from the company's  presentation  at the Macquarie Conference today. Atop reporting on the company's historic growth trajectory and recent new store openings, CEO Lachlan McCann said sales revenue in Q3 FY 2024 was up 6.4% year on year. Total sales over the nine months to March were up 2.1%. As for the outlook, the company said that its aftermarket order book \"remains strong\". And its export order book was said to be \"trending positively\", with ARB achieving export sales growth of 2.1% in Q3 FY 2024. The ASX 200 share also expects sales to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) will keep growing in FY 2024 and into FY 2025 based on contracts it already has in place. ARB could also receive some ongoing tailwinds, with new vehicle supply and lead times improving across the world. In the quarter just past, the company reported sales growth across each of its Australian aftermarket, export, and OEM sales channels. And McCann said the outlook is \"trending positively, with favourable trading conditions expected to continue\" into the first half of FY 2025. With today's intraday boost factored in, the ASX 200 share is up 20% over 12 months."},

If you are then it could be worth looking at the ASX All Ords shares listed below. That's because they have just been named as buys by analysts at  Bell Potter  and tipped to rise 16% to 40%. Here's what the broker is saying about these stocks: Domain Holdings Australia Ltd  ( ASX: DHG ) Bell Potter was pleased with this property listings company's quarterly update. Particularly given that listings are improving after a difficult period. It said:   Observed sales and total Buy listings data points on respective residential listings platforms have affected a reversal since flattening in March. Trends into Q4 appear to support growing new Buy listings for DHG based on increased total Buy listings (89% from 86% in Feb) improving concurrently with total R1m sales (86% from 66% in Feb) relative to REA which potentially imply DHG listings are gaining against its competitor via new listings replenishing sold stock at a quicker rate.   In light of the above, the broker has lifted its earnings per share estimates and is now forecasting an \"adj. EPS CAGR of ~26% b/w FY24-26.\" Bell Potter has retained its buy rating and $3.75 price target on the ASX All Ords share. This implies a potential upside of 16% for investors. Develop Global Ltd  ( ASX: DVP ) Another ASX All Ords share that has been given the thumbs up by Bell Potter on Wednesday is Develop Global. It is a mineral exploration company with a focus on future-facing metals. In addition, it is a mining services provider that is currently working on the underground development of the Mt Marion Lithium Mine owned by  Mineral Resources Ltd  ( ASX: MIN ). Bell Potter was reasonably pleased with a recent scoping study from the Pioneer Dome  lithium  project, noting that it \"appears conservative.\" Which is always a good thing when valuing a project based on forecast commodity prices. It said:   We believe the Study applies conservative average LOM SC6 price forecasts of US$1,393/t. Long-term SC6 prices applied to our Pioneer Dome asset model are US$1,600/t, yielding an unrisked NPV(10.5% real) of A$273m. For context, using the Study price outlook in our model yields an unrisked NPV(10.5% real) of A$215m.   Outside this, the broker believes the company is well placed for growth thanks to the development of another project, the Woodlawn Zinc-Copper Mine. It said:   DVP are advancing multiple critical mineral projects simultaneously, with each development representing an opportunity to transform the company's earnings and FCF generation. The most advanced of these projects, Woodlawn, is expected to recommence production in 1H CY25; FID and announcement of a financing package are important upcoming catalysts.   Bell Potter has a buy rating and a $3.20 price target on the ASX All Ords share. This implies a potential upside of 36% for investors."},

Today, the spotlight is on  Perpetual Ltd  ( ASX: PPT ) as details of its talks with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co, known as  KKR & Co Inc  ( NYSE: KKR ), boil to the surface.  After much speculation, the Australian investment group revealed the outcome of its  strategic review  this morning.  The review, which sought to 'unlock additional value for shareholders', has yielded a few notable changes, including arguably the biggest change for the company in its more than century-long existence. In response, the Perpetual share price is tumbling 7% to $22.35. Historic change for 138-year-old Australian brand At the end of Perpetual's review, the decision has been made to sell the wealth management and corporate trust businesses. The Sydney-based firm will focus solely on being a global multi-boutique asset manager.  It's a verdict that will see Perpetual depart from its 138-year-old roots. The company was originally formed as a trustee company in 1885, managing the estates of many Australians before getting started in the fund management game in the 1980s.  Asset management powerhouse KKR has agreed to acquire the businesses from the ASX 200 stock via a scheme of arrangement. Perpetual will receive a total cash consideration of A$2.175 billion in return, valuing the businesses at 13.7 times the last 12 months'  earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) .  Commenting on the outcome of Perpetual's review, group chair Tony D'Aloisio said:    […] The Board has concluded that becoming a standalone asset management business, rather than a complex diversified financial services conglomerate which is difficult for the market to value, will provide better long-term value for Perpetual shareholders.    The board unanimously recommends the proposal to shareholders, labelling it as a 'positive and compelling outcome'.  What will become of the ASX 200 stock? Perpetual will continue to exist on the ASX if the deal goes forward — but the company will look a little different.  Management describes the remaining operations as a debt-free asset manager with scale. As shown below, Perpetual will hold $227 billion in assets under management post-sale via its brands: Perpetual, Pendal, Barrow Hanley, Trillium, etc. Source: Perpetual Investor Presentation Strategic Review However, the Perpetual brand will be owned by KKR. A licensing agreement will allow the company to continue using the label for up to seven years, although the plan is to rebrand by the end of 2025.  The deal is slated to be completed by February next year.  Lastly, another blow for the ASX 200 stock today could relate to a management change. Today's release also revealed CEO and managing director Rob Adams will retire at the end of a transition period. A global search has commenced to find a replacement."},

You're not alone. The  All Ordinaries Index  (ASX: XAO) has underperformed the stellar run we've witnessed on the  S&P 500   Index  (SP: .INX). But investors buying a diversified basket of stocks a year ago should have handily outpaced  inflation  as well as the returns they might have earned from a cash term deposit. Over the past year, the All Ords has gained 8.0%. So far in 2024, the index is up 2.6%. That compares to a 25.4% 12-month gain posted by the S&P 500, which is up 9.4% in 2024. With those gains in mind, is right now a good time to buy ASX shares? Or should investors bear in mind the old adage to 'sell in May and go away'? Here's what the experts are saying. The case to wait Making the case not to rush out and buy ASX shares just yet is Will Hamilton, managing partner of Hamilton Wealth Partners. Hamilton points out that the strong run enjoyed by the markets has been driven by expectations of multiple interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve. Now, he notes, \"The odds of no easing in 2024 [are] rising, but also the once-unthinkable prospect of the Fed having to raise rates again is possible.\" According to Hamilton: \n I feel we are entering a classic 'sell in May and go away' as traders square their books for the northern summer and market expectations drift lower. After the extreme optimism this is not a bad thing and can set the remainder of 2024 up for a reason to remain optimistic. \n If Hamilton has it right, you may wish to hold onto your investment cash and buy ASX shares a little later in the year. The case to buy ASX shares now Nucleus Wealth's Damien Klassen  quotes  legendary investor Warren Buffett in his case that now is a great time to buy ASX shares. \"In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine,\" Warren Buffett famously said. \"So in the short term, anything can happen but over the long term, the returns that tend to show up are very likely to be positive and reflective of business growth,\" Klassen says. And investors buying ASX shares now who have longer investment horizons should enjoy lower risks than short-term investors. According to Klassen: \n The longer your time horizons are and the longer you hold your investment for, the lower your true risk of capital loss is because you have time to ride out any short-term corrections. There is also more chance that your investment will increase over time with the natural appreciation of markets and therefore your risk will reduce. \n And he cautions on the dangers of trying to time the market and waiting to buy stocks at their lows. \"Many people are waiting for the market to fall and then they will invest,\" he said. He continued: \n However, this can be a risky strategy that leaves many investors on the sidelines for years not knowing when to get into the market (or back into the market). With capital sitting in cash in the current climate you are receiving a negative real return after inflation is taken into account which is not a great strategy. \n And he believes investors shouldn't let uncertainty over what may happen over the weeks ahead hold them back from buying ASX shares. \"Uncertainty is nothing new and it needs to be expected and embraced,\" he said. Klassen concluded: \n My bet is that history will likely repeat itself, and we will look back at this time in the future and wonder what everyone was worrying about and were very glad we invested for the long-term when we did."},

Here's why you need to hurry", "title_link": "https://www.fool.com.au/2024/05/08/want-the-massive-westpac-dividend-heres-why-you-need-to-hurry/", "published_date": "May 8, 2024", "publisher_name": "Sebastian Bowen", "Description": "It's been an interesting day for the  Westpac Banking Corp  ( ASX: WBC ) so far this Wednesday. Westpac shares opened in the green this morning, starting out at $28 flat after closing at $27.89 yesterday. This  ASX 200 bank stock  even rose to hit a new 52-week high soon after trading commenced – $28.05. But since then, investors have cooled their jets. At present, Westpac has dropped convincingly into the red. The bank is currently down a hefty 0.75% at $27.68 a share. Investors can expect continued  volatility  in the Westpac share price tomorrow as well. That's because tomorrow is the day that Westpac is scheduled to trade  ex-dividend  for its latest shareholder payment. It was only on Monday this week that Westpac revealed its latest earnings report, covering the six months to 31 March. As  we covered at the time , these earnings were welcomed by investors. That was despite some less-than-rosy numbers. The bank reported a 4% drop in net operating income to $10.59 billion. As well as a 16% fall in net profits to $3.34 billion. But it was probably Westpac's capital return plans that gave investors something to cheer about. For one, the bank announced a new $1 billion share buyback program. But it also revealed that its next interim  dividend  would come in at 75 cents per share. This payment will be  fully franked  of course. That's a happy 7.14% rise over last year's interim dividend of 70 cents per share. Big dividends coming out of Westpac shares It got better though. Westpac also surprised investors by pulling an additional special dividend out of its hat. In addition to that interim dividend of 75 cents per share, investors will also receive a special dividend of 15 cents per share. This payment will also come with full franking credits attached. As  my Fool colleague covered earlier this week , these dividends represent a  payout ratio  of 74% of Westpac's earnings for the period. If we combine these two dividend payments with Westpac's final dividend of 72 cents per share that shareholders bagged back in December, we get an annual total of $1.62 per share. At the current Westpac share price, this would give the bank stock a weighty  dividend yield  of 5.85%. However, if investors wish to see this cash arrive on their bank accounts but don't yet own Westpac shares, time is running out. That's because the Westpac share price is scheduled to trade ex-dividend tomorrow, 9 May. This effectively means that anyone who doesn't own Wetpac shares as of the close of trade today will miss out on these latest dividends. From tomorrow, any new Westpac investors will have to wait until the next dividend from Westpac is revealed before they receive a passive income paycheque. As such, expect to see a big drop in the Westpac share price on the commencement of trading tomorrow to reflect this inherent loss of value. For eligible Westpac investors, dividend payday has been set for 25 June next month."},

In afternoon trade, the ASX 200 index is on course to record the smallest of gains and is up a fraction to 7,793.8 points. Four ASX shares that are acting as a drag on the market today are listed below. Here's why they are falling: Judo Capital Holdings Ltd  ( ASX: JDO ) The Judo Capital share price is down over 2% to $1.37. This may have been driven by a broker note out of Morgan Stanley. Its analysts have retained their equal weight rating and $1.25 price target on the company's shares. This implies a potential downside of approximately 9% for investors from current levels. Judo Capital will be releasing its third quarter update in the coming days. National Australia Bank Ltd  ( ASX: NAB ) The NAB share price is down 1% to $33.81. Investors may be taking a bit of profit off the table following strong gains over the last 12 months. During this time, the banking giant's shares have risen approximately 25%. This compares to a 7% gain by the ASX 200 index over the same period. In addition, last week the team at Citi responded to NAB's half-year results by reiterating its sell rating with a $26.50 price target. This suggests a potential downside of over 20% is possible over the next 12 months. Paladin Energy Ltd  ( ASX: PDN ) The Paladin Energy share price is down 2.5% to $16.52. This could also have been driven by profit-taking from some investors. After all, the uranium miner's shares hit a  12-year high  on Tuesday. Investors have been fighting to get hold of the company's shares over the past year thanks to booming uranium prices. This is being underpinned by supply shortages and increasing demand for the chemical element as countries embrace nuclear power. Perpetual Ltd  ( ASX: PPT ) The Perpetual share price is down 7% to $22.38. This follows the conclusion of the fund manager's strategic review. That review was seeking to unlock additional value for shareholders. However, judging by its share price performance on Wednesday, the market doesn't appear to believe its plans will achieve this goal. Perpetual has decided to sell its wealth management and corporate trust businesses and focus solely on being a global multi-boutique asset manager. The company has signed an agreement to sell those businesses to private equity giant KKR for a total cash consideration of $2.175 billion."},

Why? Well, when the investment world is dominated by  inflation  and  interest rates , one offer remains attractive: earning  passive income  from  dividends.   ASX bank shares? They can be fortress-like dividend payers. One name worth noting is  Bank of Queensland  ( ASX: BOQ ). According to its  latest filings , the company serves around 1.4 million customers and has a 2.73% share of the Australian residential mortgage market. The Bank of Queensland share price has lagged the broader  ASX 200 Banks Index  (ASX: XBK), which has advanced 8.4% since January. Other ASX bank shares, such as  Commonwealth Bank of Australia  ( ASX: CBA ),  National Australia Bank Ltd  ( ASX: NAB ) and  Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd  ( ASX: ANZ ), have also outperformed the Bank of Queensland share price in 2024. But you shouldn't look away yet. Bank of Queensland currently offers us the highest  dividend yield  out of all the banking majors. As far as investment goes, this is a unique point. What is the Bank of Queensland dividend yield? Bank of Queensland shares were swapping hands at $5.86 apiece recently, producing a trailing dividend yield of 6.5%. For context, the dividend yield on  iShares Core S&P/ASX 200 ETF  ( ASX: IOZ ) at the time was 3.63%, nearly 1.8 times smaller. This is the highest yield among the banking majors. By comparison, CBA and NAB currently offer yields of 3.9% and 6.1%, respectively. Here's a recent snapshot. ASX Bank shares dividend yield Company Recent share price Trailing dividend Current dividend yield Bank of Queensland Ltd $5.86 $0.38 6.5% Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd $9.76 $0.62 6.4% ANZ Group Holdings Ltd $28.48 $1.75 6.1% Westpac Banking Corporation $26.42 $1.42 5.4% Commonwealth Bank of Australia $115.23 $4.55 3.9% Macquarie Group Ltd $183.83 $7.05 3.8% National Australia Bank $34.40 $1.67 4.9% Group average  —  $2.49 5.3% What this means is that a $1,000 investment in Bank of Queensland stock would theoretically produce $65 of annual income to the investor. You simply multiply the investment by the yield to gain your dividend income. An $8,000 investment would theoretically yield $520 of annual income if one were to invest in Bank of Queensland shares today ($8,000 times 6.% = $520.00). We can't forget the effect of  franking credits , either. The bank's most recent dividend was franked at 100%, bringing the full gross yield – that is, adjusted for franking credits – to 9.46% at the time of publication. Can investors actually gain $530 in passive income from investing $8,000 in Bank of Queensland shares? All this sounds great on paper. But this is the  trailing  dividend yield. For it to remain constant, the rate of dividends must continue going forward, and the share price mustn't creep too high. For example, if the bank were to reduce its dividend to $0.35 per share today, the dividend yield would fall to 5.6%. The opposite is also true if it were to increase. See the table below. Change Dividend per share Yield at recent share price ($5.86) Increase $0.50 8.55% Same $0.41 7.01% Decrease $0.35 5.98% Just remember – companies pay dividends from their earnings. If profits are down, the dividend payment may be reduced. So, if Bank of Queensland maintains its current annual dividend and the share price remains steady, investors could expect to earn $520 of income for every $8,000 invested in Bank of Queensland shares. If it doesn't? These figures will change. Based on the company's track record, profits, and overall strength of the economy, it would be hard to see Bank of Queensland slash its dividend any time soon, in my best estimation."},

In early trade, the industrial property company's shares rose 1.5% to a new record high of $34.90. Why is the Goodman share price rising? Investors have been buying the company's shares this morning following the release of its  third-quarter update . According to the release, Goodman delivered a strong operating performance for three months, which management believes positions the business well for the full year and into FY 2025. In fact, trading was so strong that the company has upgraded its guidance for FY 2024 for a second time. Initially, Goodman was targeting operating earnings per share growth of 9% this year. It then upgraded this to 11% growth when it released its half-year results in February. Management now expects operating earnings per share growth of 13% in FY 2024. This is being underpinned by a portfolio occupancy rate of 98% and 12-month rolling like-for-like net property income growth of 4.9%. Management commentary Goodman's CEO, Greg Goodman, was pleased with the quarter. He said:   Our active asset management continues to optimise returns for our investors as we deliver essential infrastructure for the expanding digital economy. The location and quality of our properties enables increased productivity, driving demand as our logistics customers are seeking to improve their supply chain efficiency using automation and offering faster transit times. We continue to develop large-scale, high value, data centres, and expand our global power bank to address growing data centre demand as AI usage and cloud computing expands.   During the quarter we internalised the management of the NZX-listed Goodman Property Trust providing a platform for growth for GMT. We continue to review our assets and capital allocation globally, and expect further recycling of capital over time.   Outlook Speaking about the company's outlook, Goodman acknowledges that real estate markets will be volatile but believes it is well placed to navigate this. He adds:   The Group continues to execute on its strategy. The challenge of the uncertain interest rate environment, persistent inflation, combined with slowing economic growth, is prolonging volatility in global markets and increased cost of capital.   In the near term we believe aggregate logistics demand is likely to remain at more moderate levels compared to that experienced in the pandemic period. However, supply has been significantly reduced globally, and is generally very constrained in our markets. Our customers remain focused on maximising productivity from their space, preferring infill locations and increasing their investments in technology and automation. Combined with the scarcity of available assets in the markets we operate, should support rental growth and high occupancy.   At the end of the quarter, Goodman had $12.9 billion of development work in progress across 82 projects. The Goodman share price is up 72% over the last 12 months."},

The COVID-19 period was a perfect example that not all  blue-chip  dividends are safe, with cuts from stocks like  ASX bank shares  and  Transurban Group  ( ASX: TCL ).

Over half of the rental income is linked to CPI  inflation , so this period of elevated inflation has been supportive for rental income growth. Another 33% of the rental income has fixed rental income (with market reviews). These two areas of rental income growth can help drive the underlying value and rental profits of the ASX 300 stock. Rural Funds is also working on macadamia orchard developments, with a 40-year lease commenced in January 2024. Development of 3,000 hectares is forecast to be materially complete in 2024. Rent is earned on the value of land, water and capital expenditure as it's deployed – $173 million was deployed by the end of the  first half of FY24 , with an increase forecast to $298 million by FY25. Solid distribution yield  A good, higher-yield  ASX dividend share  needs to have a solid  distribution yield  in my books. Ideally, it's better than what someone could get from a savings account. The ASX 300 stock is expecting to pay a distribution per unit of 11.73 cents, which currently translates into a distribution yield of 5.8%. The business still intends to target distribution growth of 4% per annum, as well as generating capital growth. Discount to NAV A REIT investor can only know what the true  net asset value (NAV)  is if they try to sell the assets. Rural Funds regularly gets independent valuers to work out what the asset values are. The business said its adjusted NAV – which includes water entitlements at market value rather than at cost – was $3.07 at 31 December 2023. The Rural Funds share price is at a 35%  discount to this NAV .  The Rural Funds share price has dropped over 30% from its peak in early 2022. I think it's a good time to buy shares at around $2."},

Businesses that have temporarily dropped can be  buy-the-dip  opportunities. Stocks that are still growing their operations/revenue have a high chance of rebounding, in my opinion. Share prices usually follow the direction of earnings over time and revenue growth is a very important driver of profit growth. With that in mind, below are the two ASX 200 shares I like the look of and recently decided to invest in. Sonic Healthcare Ltd ( ASX: SHL ) Sonic is a leading pathology business with operations in numerous countries including the USA, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, UK, Belgium and New Zealand. Despite being in the  defensive  sector of  healthcare , the Sonic Healthcare share price has dropped 25% in the last year, as we can see on the chart below. The company is no longer receiving the COVID-19 testing revenue, and it's facing a much higher net interest expense because of higher  interest rates  and acquisitions. Why can it keep growing earnings in the long term? There are a number of tailwinds. Firstly, its base business (excluding COVID-19 revenue) organic revenue growth was 6.2% in the  FY24 first half , which I'd say is a solid increase. Total base business revenue rose 15% thanks to acquisitions in places like Switzerland and Germany. Sonic says that since July 2023, at least A$500 million of new annual revenue has been secured from acquisitions and contract wins. The company is also expecting to deliver good revenue and margin synergies from recent  acquisitions  and investments.  I also think the ASX 200 share has tailwinds like ageing populations and growing populations in the key markets of the US, Australia, the UK and Germany. According to the estimates on Commsec, the Sonic Healthcare share price is valued at 18x FY25's estimated earnings, with a projected  dividend yield  of 4% (excluding  franking credits ). Corporate Travel Management Ltd ( ASX: CTD ) Corporate Travel Management is one of the largest global operators. COVID-19 was a rough time for the business, but profit has come soaring back. In the  FY24 first-half result , underlying  net profit after tax (NPAT)  jumped 162% to $57.9 million and statutory NPAT soared 222% to $50.4 million. Despite that, the Corporate Travel Management share price is down 20% in 2024, as seen on the chart below. The business is winning new customer contracts and seeing existing customers grow their spending with the ASX 200 share. Since listing in 2010, the business has had a high client retention rate of 97%. Over the next five years, the business expects revenue to grow by at least 10% per annum. It aims to win $1 billion per year in FY25 and rise to $1.6 billion per year by FY29. Acquisitions (and the acquired revenue) will supplement this. The company is expecting  earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)  to grow at a  compound annual growth rate (CAGR)  of 15% thanks to new client wins, retention and project execution.  According to Commsec, the Corporate Travel Management share price is valued at 14x FY25's estimated earnings with a dividend yield of 3.2% (excluding franking credits)."},

Shares in the  S&P/ASX 200 Index  (ASX: XJO)  travel stock  closed yesterday trading for $20.59. In morning trade on Wednesday, shares are swapping hands for $20.89 apiece, up 1.4%. For some context, the ASX 200 is up 0.24% at this same time. This comes as investors mull over the trading update and  presentation  by Flight Centre CFO Adam Campbell at the Macquarie Conference. Here are the highlights. Flight Centre share price boosted on reaffirmed profit guidance The Flight Centre share price is marching higher, with the company eyeing record sales for the full 2024 financial year (FY 2024). Campbell said the business was on track to exceed the previous record total transaction value (TTV) of $23.7 billion it achieved in FY 2019. And despite impacting its year-on-year growth, Flight Centre lauded falling airfare prices as a \"very positive development\". Campbell said that while international airfare prices were still above pre-COVID levels, they're now falling in Australia and \"expected to stimulate further demand, particularly in leisure\" travel. The Flight Centre share price is also likely gaining support after the company reaffirmed its profit guidance, saying it expected strong year-on-year growth. With trade said to be \"broadly in line with expectations\", management is continuing to target underlying profit before tax (PBT) in the range of $300 million to $340 million for FY 2024. This compares to PBT of $106 million in FY 2023. Campbell highlighted that if Flight Centre achieved the midpoint of its targeted profit range, this would represent 200% year-on-year growth. In another strong metric, Flight Centre reported improved margins. In the third quarter (Q3 FY 2024), the company's underlying PBT margin increased by 0.60% from Q3 FY 2023. Campbell noted that revenue and cost margins were both tracking well ahead of the prior corresponding period. He added these were set for \"further improvement as the market recovery continues and as key strategies gain traction, delivering operating leverage\". Among the positive emerging market trends, the company said its outbound capacity in April was tracking at 95% of pre-COVID levels in Australia. A history of growth Though still in recovery mode from the COVID blow, the Flight Centre share price has a history of growth. That's been supported by the company's remarkable achievement of growing its TTV year-on-year 25 times in 29 years since listing. Campbell noted that two of the years it failed to grow TTV were during the pandemic closures. Among the company's strengths, he cited that its leisure business was leveraged to outbound travel, noting this market had grown at a 5.9%  compound annual growth rate  (CAGR) over the 40 years pre-COVID."},

The Africa-based ASX  lithium  stock has been out of action since the middle of September. This has been caused by issues arising from the introduction of a new Mining Code in Mali which impacted its Goulamina Lithium Project. What's going on with this ASX lithium stock? The good news for shareholders is that the company's shares could soon return to trade. That's because this morning, Leo Lithium  announced  that it has come to an agreement with the Mali Government. According to the release, Leo Lithium and its joint venture partner, Ganfeng Lithium, have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Government of Mali which resolves all outstanding issues. This includes Leo Lithium entering into a further binding share sale and purchase agreement (SPA) to sell its remaining 40% interest in the Goulamina Lithium Project to Ganfeng Lithium for US$342.7 million. The previously agreed co-operation agreement, which included offtake rights, will be terminated. However, Ganfeng will pay a 1.5% gross revenue fee over 20 years to Leo Lithium in exchange for the offtake and other rights given up. Sale breakdown The ASX lithium stock advised that the US$342.7 million cash consideration that is payable by Ganfeng Lithium is structured as follows:   US$10.5 million non-refundable deposit to be paid within 10 days of executing the sale and purchase agreement.   US$161.0 million payable on completion of the transaction following satisfaction of conditions precedent.   US$171.2 million payable on 30 June 2025 or an earlier date.   Management notes that US$342.7 million is equivalent to A$0.43 per Leo Lithium share. This compares to its most recent share price of A$0.505. When will Leo Lithium shares return? With these issues now resolved, it may not be long until we see this ASX lithium stock trading again. Management advised that it will discuss with ASX the necessary next steps to lift the suspension. Though, it concedes that the lifting of the suspension will be at the discretion of the ASX. An update will be provided in due course. Leo Lithium Managing Director, Simon Hay, believes the agreement is in the best interests of shareholders. He said:   Despite our best efforts to reach a viable agreement with the Mali Government and considering the increasing risks associated with operating in Mali, the impact of the new 2023 Mining Code and the Company's financial position for future funding, the Board of Leo Lithium has determined that a sale of the Company's remaining interest in Goulamina is in the best interests of Leo Lithium shareholders. The Board believes the executed Sale and Purchase Agreement with Ganfeng provides our shareholders with certain value under highly challenging circumstances.   Our relationship with Ganfeng remains strong, and we look forward to the next phase of our partnership. We have deeply appreciated our shareholders' patience and support whilst we worked to settle this issue with the Mali Government. Given the circumstances, we believe this settlement and sale of the Project to Ganfeng represents the best outcome for all Goulamina stakeholders."},

In morning trade, the ASX 200 healthcare stock is up 8% to $2.29. This means the company's shares are now up approximately 35% since the start of the year. Why is this ASX 200 healthcare stock rocketing? Investors have been scrambling to buy the company's shares this morning in response to the release of a  very positive trading update . According to the release, Polynovo had a record month of revenue in April thanks to strong growth across the business. Polynovo advised that its US business recorded monthly sales of A$6.9 million, which was an increase of 75% on the prior corresponding period. The Rest of the World business grew almost as quickly. It delivered monthly sales of A$2.4 million, which was an increase of 68.2% over the prior corresponding period. This reflects strong growth in the UK and Ireland, ANZ, Hong Kong, and Germany. Including a small contribution from BARDA revenue, this ultimately led to PolyNovo achieving record monthly group revenue of A$10.1 million. This represents a 68.6% increase on the same period last year. The ASX 200 healthcare stock's chair, David Williams, was very pleased with the company's performance and its sales trajectory. He said:   Rest of World sales are very pleasing, coming off a low base. The direction is clear, and with new geographies and new patient applications I couldn't be happier. It's hard to contain my excitement when I see first time orders into Turkey, Abu Dhabi and Ukraine as I think of the lives we are saving.   This sentiment was echoed by the company's CEO, Swami Raote. He said:   We are grateful for the manner in which clinicians are helping us with insights, innovation, education and adoption beyond difficult burns to other areas in plastic and reconstructive surgery. Our global impact continues to accelerate, with 42,000+ patients treated across 39 countries.   What is PolyNovo? PolyNovo is a medical device company focused on advanced wound care that designs, develops, and manufactures dermal regeneration solutions. These solutions are developed using its patented NovoSorb biodegradable polymer technology. The key NovoSorb BTM product is a dermal scaffold for the regeneration of the dermis when lost through extensive surgery, trauma or burn. It is a novel range of bio-resorbable polymers that can be produced in many formats including film, fibre, foam, and coatings. The ASX 200 healthcare stock notes that its unique properties provide excellent biocompatibility, control over physical properties, and a programmable bio-resorption profile. Based on today's sales update, it seems to be growing in popularity with end users."},

Shares in  IPH Ltd  ( ASX: IPH ) are faltering this morning after the intellectual property services provider revealed a takeover bid for one of its peers. The bid, worth roughly $250 million, is being met with a 0.7% decline to $6.11 in the IPH share price. Which competitor is this ASX 200 stock buying? Few people have likely heard of  QANTM Intellectual Property Ltd  ( ASX: QIP ). At just shy of a $250 million  market capitalisation , it's not quite in the 'big leagues' of the ASX. However, that hasn't prevented the company from receiving its fair share of interest this year, setting the share price into motion. On 27 February, QANTM cleared the air amid media speculation that it was subject to an offer. Indeed it was. A non-binding indicative proposal from UK-based international intellectual property (IP) firm Rouse International Holdings, aka Rouse.  The interest didn't stop there either.  Two weeks later, QANTM was fielding yet another offer. This time from Adamantem Capital, an Australian private equity firm that manages around $1.4 billion worth of assets, offering $1.817 per share.  Rouse has since dropped out of the running. But a new contestant has now entered the fray, with fellow ASX-listed IPH lobbing a bid at QANTM this morning.  As per the  release , IPH is putting forward a scheme of arrangement of 0.291 IPH shares and a fully franked special dividend of up to 11 cents per share in cash for each QANTM share. In simplified terms, it values QANTM at $1.90 apiece.  QANTM extended its exclusivity period with Adamantem to 15 May 2024 on Monday.  Why? A quick look at IPH's  balance sheet  might give some pause for thought.  The ASX 200 stock is saddled with over $500 million in debt as of 31 December 2023, with about $126 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company is already highly leveraged at a debt-to-equity ratio of approximately 81%.  So, what's the rationale here?  IPH CEO Dr Andrew Blattman explains the thinking behind the offer, stating:   Pursuing strategic and financially accretive M&A [ mergers and acquisitions ] has long been a core pillar of IPH's growth strategy and we are regularly assessing a range of potential transactions across the regions in which we operate. We believe that the time is right for a combination of QANTM and IPH and we see a compelling strategic rationale to the acquisition which will support a range of benefits to shareholders, employees, and clients.    Furthermore, Blattman expressed excitement about the potential to increase the company's presence in Asia if the takeover is successful.  While the ASX 200 stock might be down, shares in QANTM are up 7.4% on today's news."},

Shares in the  S&P/ASX 300 Index  (ASX: XKO)  telco  closed yesterday trading for $3.93. After opening higher, shares have since given back those gains and are trading for $3.90 apiece, down 0.8%. For some context, the ASX 300 is up 0.2% at this same time. This comes following the release of Aussie Broadband's trading  update  for the three months ending 31 March (3Q FY 2024). Here are the highlights. Aussie Broadband share price dips despite growth The Aussie Broadband share price is slipping today, despite the company reporting it had added 18,788 broadband services during the quarter. The company flagged its Enterprise & Government segment as a strong performer, adding new clients across the retail, food, and local government sectors. The quarter also saw Aussie Broadband successfully complete its acquisition of software communication network provider Symbio. The company expects Symbio will achieve its FY 2024 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation ( EBITDA ) contribution in line with prior guidance. Over the three months, Aussie Broadband's non-binding indicative offer to acquire 100% of the shares of  Superloop Ltd  ( ASX: SLC ) was rejected by the Superloop board. This resulted in the disposal of 37.6 million Superloop shares, which in turn resulted in a one-off gain for Aussie Broadband of $13.4 million, after transaction costs and before tax. The ASX 300 telco reaffirmed its FY 2024 EBITDA guidance of $116 million to $121 million. This includes the four-month contribution from Symbio. What did management say? Commenting on the results leaving the Aussie Broadband share price on the flat side today, managing director Phillip Britt said, \"We are pleased to have welcomed Symbio into the Group. This successful acquisition represents Aussie's continued strategic investment into our Wholesale and E&G market segments.\" Britt added: \n The group continues to assess other strategic investments to advance our ongoing growth ambitions. We expect to see further market consolidation and will look to participate in that where value can be created, and it makes strategic sense to do so. \n\n\n\n While the outcome of negotiations with Origin was disappointing, I remain confident in our growth trajectory. We have a number of strategies in place to deliver on our growth agenda, which we are in the process of executing. \n Britt also noted the award-winning year the company has had. \"Our customer service continues to be recognised as market leading. Aussie Broadband was the first business to win three awards in a single year from Roy Morgan,\" he said. Despite today's dip, the Aussie Broadband share price remains up more than 27% over 12 months."},
{"source_name": "The Motley Fool", "title": "2 ASX passive income shares poised to pay a 9% yield", "title_link": "https://www.fool.com.au/2024/05/08/2-asx-passive-income-shares-poised-to-pay-a-9-yield/", "published_date": "May 8, 2024", "publisher_name": "Zach Bristow", "Description": "As  inflation  drives the cost of living higher, many are turning to  passive income shares  for returns. Thankfully, as an Australian investor, you're in the right place. There are plenty of ASX shares across all sectors paying chunky  dividends  to their shareholders, year after year. As we've noted before, dividends  hedge against inflation,  offer tax advantages (thank you,  franking credits !) and provide a second source of investment return. Here are two passive income shares that experts think are fundamentally sound and poised to carry dividend yields of 9%. Incitec Pivot Ltd ( ASX: IPL ) First on the list of passive income shares is fertiliser and chemicals company Incitec Pivot. The company recently returned a mammoth $500 million of cash to its shareholders following  the sale  of its ammonia manufacturing plant to  CF Industries Holdings Inc  ( NYSE: CF ) in 2023. In response, shareholders received two returns – one a 15.57 cents per share equal capital reduction, followed by an unfranked special dividend of 10.17 cents per share. This is great – but we are talking a trailing  yield  here. Can Incitec continue this trend? The team at Atlas Funds Management  believe so . After the plant sale, the fund manager is bullish on Incitec's potential to return capital to shareholders. \"Additional capital returns could result from selling the Australian fertiliser operations as the company becomes a pure-play explosives company,\" it said in a recent note. The global explosives market is  tipped  to grow more than 6% per year from 2024 to 2030, reaching a value of $543 billion. Atlas' view is another potential catalyst for Incitec after it  posted  its second-highest  net profit after tax (NPAT ) of $582 million in FY 2023. A strong market and strong earnings are two flavoursome ingredients to any dividend recipe. Atlas also said the company was \"expected to conduct a $0.26 per share capital return\". At the recent Incitec Pivot share price of $2.79 per share, this return of 26 cents equates to a 9.3% forward dividend yield, which cannot be ignored, in my opinion. Accent Group Ltd ( ASX: AX1 ) A second contender on the list of passive income shares is footwear  retailer  Accent Group. Accent boasts an extensive portfolio of well-known retail brands, including The Athletes Foot, Platypus, Glue Store, and Hype DC, just to name a few. The company is well-positioned to continue its growth route after posting sales of $810.9 million in its H1 FY 2024 financial results.  Average sales were around $912,000 per store after it added 72 new sites in H2 FY 2023, bringing its total to 888 locations. You would receive a 7.43% dividend yield as passive income in buying Accent shares today – assuming no changes to the company's dividend, of course. But we don't get paid for what's already happened. What's to come? Both  JP Morgan  and  Bell Potter Securities  have price targets of $2.20 per share on Accent following a sharp pullback in its stock. Analysts at JP Morgan see the company opening another 20 stores in the second half of FY 2024. This would bring its total to more than 900. Meanwhile, Bell Potter believes this passive income share could pay dividends of 13 cents apiece this year, bringing the yield to 7.1%. But with the dividend franked at 100%, this brings the gross yield above 10%. Investors would receive a 19.6% return if the company were to hit the $2.20 price target from today. This rises to 26.6% total return if Accent pays the 13 cent dividends per share this year. Under this scenario, a $1,000 investment would be valued at $1,260."},

This has led to the release of a number of broker notes this week. Three ASX shares that brokers have named as buys this week are listed below. Here's why their analysts are feeling bullish on them right now: Lovisa Holdings Ltd  ( ASX: LOV ) According to a note out of Bell Potter, its analysts have retained their buy rating on this fashion jewellery retailer's shares with an improved price target of $36.00. The broker has been looking at the retail sector and is feeling very bullish on Lovisa's outlook. Particularly after revisiting its store network growth assumptions for new markets after taking into account some recent data points from markets such as Netherlands, Ireland, Canada, and Peru. Bell Potter estimates that Lovisa can grow its store network by 10% per annum between FY 2023 and FY 2034. In addition, it notes that there have been some encouraging trends out of the e-commerce platforms in both Australia and the US compared to its key rival. All in all, this has led to the broker boosting its earnings estimates and valuation accordingly. The Lovisa share price is trading at $31.46 on Wednesday. Regis Resources Ltd  ( ASX: RRL ) A note out of Macquarie reveals that its analysts have retained their overweight rating and $2.60 price target on this gold miner's shares. This follows news that the company has approved the development of two new underground projects at Duketon in support of its underground growth strategy. These two underground mines are expected to deliver a steady state annualised gold production target of between 100,000 ounces to 120,000 ounces from FY 2027. Macquarie was pleased with the news and the longer-than-expected mine life they provide. And while it has trimmed its near term earnings slightly, the longer mine life offsets this. As a result, there are no changes to its valuation. The Regis Resources share price is fetching $2.13 this afternoon. Telstra Group Ltd  ( ASX: TLS ) Analysts at Goldman Sachs have retained their buy rating and $4.55 price target on this telco giant's shares. The broker has been looking at its earnings estimates for Telstra in response to recent share price weakness and a guidance downgrade from  Spark New Zealand Ltd  ( ASX: SPK ). The good news is that Goldman remains confident in its forecast for EBITDA of $8.61 billion in FY 2025. This represents a $351 million increase on Goldman's FY 2024 estimate. In light of this, it feels that recent share price weakness has created a buying opportunity. The Telstra share price is trading at $3.64 today."},

Here's what brokers are forecasting from them in the near term: Charter Hall Retail REIT ( ASX: CQR ) The first ASX 200 dividend stock for income investors to consider buying is Charter Hall Retail REIT. It is a property company operated by  Charter Hall Group  ( ASX: CHC ), which has a focus on supermarket anchored neighbourhood and sub-regional shopping centre markets. The team at Citi is positive on the company. This is due partly to its inflation-linked rental increases, which it expects to underpin some big  dividend yields . Its analysts are forecasting dividends of 28 cents per share in both FY 2024 and FY 2025. Based on the current Charter Hall Retail REIT share price of $3.39, this will mean a very large yield of 8.25%. Citi has a buy rating and a $4.00 price target on its shares. Inghams Group Ltd  ( ASX: ING ) Another ASX 200 dividend stock that could be in the buy zone according to analysts is Australia's leading poultry producer, Inghams. Morgans thinks that the company's shares are undervalued at the current level. Especially given its leadership position and attractive dividend yield. It also notes that the company is \"leveraged to poultry – the affordable, healthy, sustainable and growth protein.\" In respect to dividends, the broker is forecasting fully franked dividends of 22 cents per share in FY 2024 and then 23 cents per share in FY 2025. Based on the current Inghams share price of $3.82, this equates to dividend yields of 5.75% and 6%, respectively. Morgans has an add rating and a $4.40 price target on the company's shares. Super Retail Group Ltd ( ASX: SUL ) Over at Goldman Sachs, its analysts think income investors should look at buying this ASX 200 dividend stock. Super Retail is the company behind the BCF, Macpac, Rebel, and Super Cheap Auto brands. Goldman notes that through these brands, Super Retail is \"building a competitive advantage through 11.1mn members and 76% sales to members.\" The broker expects this to \"help drive sales in a more complex operating environment.\" Its analysts believe this will support the payment of fully franked dividends per share of 67 cents in FY 2024 and then 73 cents in FY 2025. Based on the latest Super Retail share price of $13.81, this will mean dividend yields of 4.85% and 5.3%, respectively. Goldman also sees plenty of upside for investors from current levels. It has a buy rating and $17.80 price target on its shares."},

If you said  Alliance Nickel Ltd  ( ASX: AXN ), give yourself a virtual gold star. Here's why investors are sending the ASX mining stock rocketing on Thursday. ASX mining stock explodes on government project award With nickel prices tumbling in 2023 amid growing cheaper and dirtier nickel supplies out of Indonesia and China, a lot of Aussie nickel miners have come under pressure. Indeed, as of market open this morning, the Alliance Nickel share price was down 60% over the past 12 months. But the ASX mining stock is shaking off those losses and a lot more today after reporting that the Australian federal government has granted its NiWest Nickel Cobalt Project, Major Project Status. Located in Western Australia, NiWest is reported to contain one of Australia's highest-grade undeveloped nickel laterite mineral resources. The ASX mining stock is targeting production of 90,000 tonnes nickel sulphate and 7,000 tonnes cobalt sulphate per year from the project. NiWest marks the first Australian nickel project granted Major Project Status since nickel was added to the critical minerals list in February. The status is awarded to Australian companies and projects the government believes are strategically significant. Among the benefits, these projects can expect to receive additional support with federal and state regulatory approvals for a three-year period. Alliance Nickel said that it was granted the status for NiWest in recognition of the potential contribution to Australia's economic growth and critical minerals industry. It said this recognition will help support the rapid advancement of the project. And it noted that this comes at an opportune time \"as global demand for IRA compliant battery-grade nickel and cobalt grows\". Commenting on the government award sending the ASX mining stock flying higher today, Alliance Nickel CEO Paul Kopejtka said:   We are delighted NiWest has been recognised by the Australian Government as a project of national significance. NiWest is the first nickel project to be awarded MPS since nickel was added to the Critical Minerals List earlier this year.   The NiWest Project is now recognised as significant from an industry and economic perspective, and we look forward to working closely with relevant Ministers, Government and industry bodies as we move towards construction."},

After all, a company's dividend history is arguably an effective barometer of how financially successful it is and how it has delivered for shareholders over long periods of time. Management teams can talk about future growth, exciting opportunities, a stock market that isn't seeing true value, or how their company's shares are on the precipice of exploding all they want. But seeing cash move from a company to its shareholders over many years instils confidence like nothing else. It's the corporate equivalent of putting one's money where one's mouth is. An ASX 200 stock that happens to be able to boast of a 121-year streak of delivering absolute dividend stability is  Washington H. Soul Pattinson and Co Ltd  ( ASX: SOL ). So I guess you might want to hear some more about this white whale. An ASX 200 stock with a 121-year history Washington H. Soul Pattinson and Co, or Soul Patts for short, is an ASX 200 stock that functions as an investing house. It managed a huge portfolio of diverse assets on behalf of its shareholders. This company's portfolio has changed considerably over time. It used to be locked up in large stakes of a very exclusive set of other ASX shares. It still has this 'Strategic Portfolio', with substantial stakes in  TPG Telecom Ltd  ( ASX: TPG ),  Brickworks Ltd  ( ASX: BKW ),  New Hope Corporation Ltd  ( ASX: NHC ) and more. But Soul Patts also owns a large and diversified portfolio of ASX 200  blue chip stocks . This includes everything from  Commonwealth Bank of Australia  ( ASX: CBA ) and  BHP Group Ltd  ( ASX: BHP ) to  CSL Ltd  ( ASX: WOW ) and  Macquarie Group Ltd  ( ASX: MQG ). This 'Large Caps' portfolio is part of Soul Patts, thanks to its acquisition of its old owner, Milton Corporation, a few years ago. In addition to these share-based investments, this ASX 200 stock also has other investments, including property, unlisted stock, private credit and venture capital. What about the dividends? But let's get down to the dividend talk. Soul Patts has been around since the 19th century, but was first listed on the ASX in 1903. Since then, this ASX 200 stock has paid out a consistent dividend every single year. The interim dividend that investors will enjoy on 11 May later this month will mark the 121st year this streak has continued. What's more, Soul Patts has also increased its annual dividend every year since 2000. That's a feat no other ASX 200 stock, or any stock on the ASX for that matter, can boast of. So it's clear that Soul Pattinson's diversified approach is successful, literally paying dividends for more than a century. Let's see if it can keep it up over the next 121 years."},

So much so, it can be hard to decide which ASX 200 dividend stocks to buy. But never fear, listed below are four options that are rated highly by brokers. They are as follows: APA Group  ( ASX: APA ) Analysts at Macquarie think that APA could be an ASX 200 dividend stock to buy. It is an energy infrastructure company that owns, manages, and operates a diverse portfolio of gas, electricity, solar and wind assets. As for dividends, the broker is forecasting dividends per share of 56 cents in FY 2024 and 57.5 cents in FY 2025.

Coles Group Ltd  ( ASX: COL ) The team at Morgans think that this supermarket giant would be a great option for passive income investors. It is expecting Coles to pay fully franked dividends of 66 cents per share in FY 2024 and 69 cents per share in FY 2025. Based on the current Coles share price of $16.33, this implies yields of approximately 4% and 4.2%, respectively. The broker currently has an add rating and $18.95 price target on its shares. Rio Tinto Ltd  ( ASX: RIO ) Goldman Sachs' analysts think that mining giant Rio Tinto could be a top ASX 200 dividend stock to buy right now. Particularly given its generous dividend yield. The broker is forecasting fully franked dividends per share of US$4.29 (A$6.52) in FY 2024 and then US$4.55 (A$6.91) in FY 2025. Based on the latest Rio Tinto share price of $130.51, this will mean yields of approximately 5% and 5.3%, respectively. The broker has a buy rating and $138.90 price target on the miner's shares. Transurban Group ( ASX: TCL ) Transurban could be another ASX 200 dividend stock to buy according to analysts at Citi. It is a toll road giant with a growing number of important roads across both Australia and North America. Citi's analysts are expecting some good yields from its shares in the coming years. The broker is forecasting dividends per share of 63.6 cents in FY 2024 and 65.1 cents in FY 2025. Based on the current Transurban share price of $12.90, this will mean yields of 4.9% and 5%, respectively. Citi has a buy rating and $15.50 price target on its shares."},

In afternoon trade on Thursday, the ASX 200 is down 0.8%. The Woodside share price, on the other hand, is surging 1.4% at the time of writing to $28.26 a share. Indeed, it's a good day for all the big ASX 200  oil and gas stocks .  Santos Ltd  ( ASX: STO ) shares are up 0.7% to $7.68, while  Beach Energy Ltd  ( ASX: BPT ) shares are leaping 2.0% to $1.62 apiece. While the Brent crude oil price is up 0.5% overnight to US$83.91 per barrel, I suspect much of today's outperformance comes thanks to the federal government's future gas plan. Woodside share price catching tailwinds The Woodside share price, along with competitors Santos and Beach Energy, could enjoy sustained tailwinds from the government's long-term  views  on the need for Australian-produced gas. This morning, Federal Resources Minister Madeleine King said (quoted by  The Australian Financial Review ):   We will need affordable gas to support energy reliability for households and businesses as we move to a more renewable grid. We need gas to support Australian manufacturing and Australian industry, and tens of thousands of Australian jobs in the manufacturing sector.   King noted that Australia's gas industry, \"creates highly paid and skilled jobs. It pays for roads, hospitals, schools and our security.\" Indeed, companies like Woodside, Santos, Beach Energy and the rest of the Aussie gas industry are reported to support more than 80,000 jobs. The industry also provides energy to more than five million homes. King said Australia's producers supply some 20% of the world's gas. This delivered $72 billion of export income for Australia's economy in 2023-24. And King highlighted how the government's gas plan can work to help the nation and its trading partners reach their emissions reduction goals. \"We need gas to help us achieve our commitment to net zero. Our trading partners depend on our gas to meet their commitments to net zero.\" Investors may also be bidding up the Woodside share price based on the lengthy timelines at stake here. \"Australia will also need gas into the future, to firm renewables and ensure the reliability of the grid,\" King said. She added that, \"Gas is needed out to 2050 and beyond.\" She continued:   Australia is committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050, and we will need gas to get there, which means we must manage the emissions from gas. And gas must remain affordable for Australian customers. To achieve this, we will need new sources of gas to meet long-term demand as existing fields deplete.   In a blow to environmental activists – but a nod to reality and a boon for the Woodside share price today – King said, \"Turning off gas overnight would do untold damage to our economy, impede efforts to get to net zero, and have a severe impact on our region.\" To help Australia reach its emissions reduction goals, she said, \"I will release more greenhouse gas acreage for carbon capture, use and storage.\" King also addressed the 'use it or lose it' provisions that have concerned the ASX oil and gas companies. \"Australia will need continued investment to develop gas supplies to get us through the energy transition with thriving industries. That will mean a continued commitment to exploration,\" she said. \"We will assess so-called use it or lose it provisions for retention leases, to get the gas we have already discovered flowing sooner.\" Santos CEO responds Like the Woodside share price, Santos shares could benefit over the longer term from the government's new gas policy. Santos CEO Kevin Gallagher  responded  to the new policy, saying (courtesy of  The Australian ), \"I'm pleased that the recognition of the role of gas is beginning to be better understood.\" Gallagher noted that around the world he's seeing \"a recognition of the importance of gas in the energy mix of the future\". And Santos has long been a supporter of increasing carbon capture and storage to help tackle emissions. \"The future of our industry is abated oil and gas, and the only way you can really abate it effectively and at scale, is through carbon capture and storage,\" Gallagher said. As for any pending 'use it or lose it' provisions, he added, \"We have just gone through a couple of years where you could 'use it' but get nothing done because we were held up with approval and regulatory roadblocks… We all want to 'use it'.\" How has the Woodside share price been tracking? Despite today's boost, the Woodside share price remains down 10% in 2024. Santos shares are just about flat. And the Beach Energy share price is down 1% year to date."},

This is a sizeable 2.3% fall from the benchmark index's all-time high set on 2 April at 7,910.5 points.  AMP has published its predictions for where the ASX 200 will be by the year's end, as well as its tips on how other asset classes, such as cash,  bonds  and property, will perform over the rest of 2024.  But first, let's recap what the ASX 200 has done so far this year… The ASX 200 began the year with a rally…  The ASX 200 started the year with a bit of weakness over the first few weeks following an outstanding Santa Rally that saw it move 11.95% higher between 31 October and 31 December.  But that new year nervousness gave way to positivity from about mid-January, and the ASX 200 moved pretty steadily towards its April peak.  The fire in its belly during those few months was optimism that there would be several  interest rate  cuts in the United States, possibly beginning in the first half of 2024, due to falling  inflation .  The expectation in Australia was for a cut in the later part of the second half of the year.  But things have changed.  US inflation  surprised on the upside  last month, which threw a bucket of cold water on the idea of rate cuts any time soon.  Australia's  March inflation rate followed the same pattern , which has also cast doubt over whether there will be a rate cut here in 2024 at all.  In fact, some economists suggest there might even be a hike!  In a new  blog , AMP chief economist Dr Shane Oliver says Australia is still at risk of a  recession , and there is  volatility  ahead for the ASX 200.  How will the ASX 200 finish the year?  AMP expects the ASX 200 to return 9% this year and to rise to about 7,900 points by the year's end.  That's just shy of its April high and indicates more volatility ahead and a rougher road for the economy. Dr Oliver points out that ASX 200 valuations were stretched following the Santa Rally, and uncertainty about the economy and the prospect for rate cuts means share price gains are likely to be constrained.  Dr Oliver said:    Easing inflation pressures, central banks moving to cut rates and prospects for stronger growth in 2025 should make for good investment returns this year.    However, with a high risk of recession, delays to rate cuts and significant geopolitical risks, the remainder of the year is likely to be far rougher and more constrained than the first three months were.   What about cash, bonds and commercial property?  In terms of other assets besides ASX 200 shares, Dr Oliver predicts:    Bonds are likely to provide returns around running yield or a bit more, as inflation slows, and central banks cut rates.   Unlisted commercial property returns are likely to be negative again due to the lagged impact of high bond yields & working from home.   Cash and bank deposits are expected to provide returns of over 4%, reflecting the back up in interest rates.   What will happen to house prices and the currency?  Dr Oliver said Australian home prices are likely to see \"more constrained gains in the year ahead as the supply shortfall remains, but still high interest rates constrain demand and unemployment rises\".  He added:    The delay in rate cuts and talk of rate hikes risks renewed falls in property prices as its likely to cause buyers to hold back and distressed listings to rise.   Dr Oliver said the Australian dollar is likely to rise to US 70 cents over the next 12 months as the overvalued American dollar falls.  He adds that, \"… in the near term the risks for the $A are on the downside as the Fed delays rate cuts and given the still high risk of an escalating conflict in the Middle East\". What's going on in the Australian economy?  Dr Oliver said a recession is \"probably the main threat\" for the Australian economy today.  While the rate of inflation is still falling, retail sales came in lower than expected in March. In fact, in per capita terms, we have now seen seven straight quarters of declining sales, despite strong population growth. This indicates a serious tightening of the belts among Australians.  Dr Oliver also said the ABS Household Spending Indicator slowed to 2.1% year over year in March.  The trade surplus fell again in March due to lower  commodity prices  and stronger imports.  \"Trade looks likely to be a big detractor from March quarter GDP growth, possibly by as much as 1 percentage point,\" Dr Oliver said. AMP's take on the housing crisis Building approvals rose less than expected in March, with the housing shortage worsening. Home values rose 0.6% in April —  the 15th consecutive month for growth , largely due to the undersupply.  Dr Oliver commented:    So far this year approvals are running around an annual pace of just 154,000 dwellings, which is well below underlying demand for housing of around 250,000 dwellings a year on the back of record immigration levels and well below the objective of Australian governments to build 240,000 dwellings a year."},

Sometimes a business announcement is positive for a company and can make the current share price cheap. A decline in the share price can also open up value in the minds of some investors. Let's look at which two ASX 200 stocks have just been upgraded. Perpetual Ltd ( ASX: PPT ) The broker Bell Potter has put a buy rating on Perpetual shares after the business announced the  sale  of its wealth management and corporate trust businesses via a scheme of arrangement for A$2.175 billion in cash. In Bell Potter analysts' eyes, the sale was a \"positive\", according to reporting by  The Australian , with the broker saying the decline was \"short-signed\". The expectations for this sale were reportedly between $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion. Bell Potter said:   More to the point, we had assumed that our top of range $1.9bn sale, would incur a $480m tax liability, which may not be the case.   The newspaper reported Bell Potter's analysis showed the ASX 200 stock's deal was a demerger rather than a straightforward sale.  The Australian  reported:   …a new head company was being created and the asset management unit would be demerged and returned to shareholders who would receive the KKR sale proceeds minus the transaction costs and repaid debt. Bell Potter said questions on tax and transaction costs missed the point.   Goodman Group ( ASX: GMG ) Macquarie's price target on Goodman shares has hiked by 4.4% to $36.37. A price target is where a broker thinks the share price will be trading 12 months from now. Therefore, Macquarie suggests Goodman shares could rise by more than 8% in the next year. Why the positivity? Goodman just released its  FY24 third-quarter update . The ASX 200 stock reported, as at 31 March 2024, that it had $12.9 billion of development work in progress (WIP) across 82 projects. Data centres under construction currently represent approximately 40% of WIP. In the latest quarter, it completed $0.8 billion of developments, with 96% of year-to-date completions committed. The business now has a $80.5 billion total property portfolio. Goodman's rental performance continues to be strong, with 4.9% like-for-like net property income growth on properties in its partnerships.  The good performance enabled the business to increase its FY24 operating  earnings per security (EPS)  growth to 13%."},

Integrated Research provides performance management and analytics for IT infrastructure, payments, and communications companies.  Not only did the company report a 93% jump in  earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA)  over the 10 months ending 30 April, it also upgraded its full-year guidance. Let's take a look at the details.  ASX tech stock skyrockets on major financial boost  For the 10 months ending 30 April, Integrated Research reported $59.1 million in total contract value (TCV), up 8% on the previous corresponding period (pcp).  Between February and April, the company secured $8.4 million in new business, including six new customers, mainly in the Americas. The renewal portfolio continues to perform well with 98% net revenue retention. Unaudited revenue for the period is $61.4 million, an increase of 11% on the pcp.  The company said it had contained cost increases to help deliver a massive 93% boost to EBITDA at $13.9 million.  Full-year 2024 results to 'materially exceed' last year  Integrated Research is now guiding FY24 TCV of $75 million to $84 million. This compares to $68.5 million for FY23.  The company expects revenue in the range of $76 million to $85 million. This compares to $69.8 million for FY23.  It anticipates EBITDA of between $18 million to $25 million. This is well above the $12.1 million EBITDA reported for FY23. Commenting on the market update, CEO John Ruthven said:    We are pleased with our YTD performance and field execution, particularly in securing several key new Collaborate customer wins.    The changes we have made to our sales leadership team and go-to-market approach over the last 12-18 months are starting to bear fruit.    As we progress through May and June, we anticipate a strong finish to the financial year.   ASX tech stock share price snapshot The Integrated Research share price has risen 70.8% in the year to date.

The  S&P/ASX 200 Consumer Discretionary Index  (ASX: XDJ) had a shocker, tanking 2.56%.

Healthcare shares  didn't live up to their name this Thursday either. The  S&P/ASX 200 Healthcare Index  (ASX: XHJ) dropped 1.17%.   ASX gold stocks  were no safe haven. The  All Ordinaries Gold Index  (ASX: XGD) saw 0.92% of its value melted away.   Communications shares  were on the nose too, illustrated by the  S&P/ASX 200 Communication Services  Index  (ASX: XTJ)'s loss of 0.66%.   Industrial stocks were another sore spot. The  S&P/ASX 200 Industrials Index  (ASX: XNJ) lost 0.63% by the end of trading.   Tech shares  didn't improve too much on that, with the  S&P/ASX 200 Information Technology Index  (ASX: XIJ) sliding 0.61%.     Finally,  mining stocks  also joined the pity party as well, with the  S&P/ASX 200 Materials Index  (ASX: XMJ) slipping 0.49%.   Turning now to the winners, and  energy shares  were the place to be today. The  S&P/ASX 200 Energy Index  (ASX: XEJ) had a great time, soaring 0.56% higher.   Utilities stocks were in demand as well. The  S&P/ASX 200 Utilities Index  (ASX: XUJ) got a 0.3% lift from the markets today.   Finally,  consumer staples shares  edged out a slight rise, with the  S&P/ASX 200 Consumer Staples Index  (ASX: XSJ) crawling 0.09% higher.

Tang has outlined his four best ideas for investors looking for new ASX All Ords shares this month.  Which 4 ASX All Ords shares should you buy in May?  These are brand-new picks for the broker and leverage two trends in the Australian economy.  As Tang explains:    Reviewing our coverage of residential developers, real estate credit providers and building materials businesses, the consistent theme is that Australia is on the cusp of a significant building boom, with record immigration levels and population growth exacerbating an already chronic housing undersupply issue.    The  latest population data  from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows the Australian population grew by 659,800 people, or 2.5%, over the 12 months to 30 September.  Net overseas migration, at 548,800 people, accounted for the bulk of this increase. Natural increase — that's births minus deaths — accounted for 111,000 new people.  The total population as of 30 September was 26,821,557. That's a lot of people to house and feed, which leads us to Tang's four top ASX All Ords share picks for May.  Broker Morgans says buy now…  Maas Group Holdings Ltd ( ASX: MGH ) This company is an ASX All Ords  small-cap share  in the industrials  market sector . Tang says:   Although the residential division remains impacted by an uncertain  interest rate  environment, the investment thesis for MGH remains mostly unchanged, in that 'infrastructure spend in the regions drives job creation and residential housing demand'.    MGH's vertically integrated model allows the business to capture margin through the whole supply chain and control costs, where possible.   The Maas Group share price closed at $4.31, down 1.6% yesterday but up 10.5% year to date.  Qualitas Ltd ( ASX: QAL ) This company is an ASX All Ords small-cap share in the  real estate sector .  Tang says:   Industry fundamentals and operational excellence sees continued growth in 1H24, with FUM growth of 41% (yoy) and Fee Earning FUM increasing 25% (yoy), leaving ~$2.1bn of dry powder to underpin future earnings growth in a sector that is experiencing increased demand, all while banks continue to retreat from the space.   The Qualitas share price was trading 2.13% higher at $2.40 at yesterday's close and up 2.56% in the year to date.  Cedar Woods Properties Limited ( ASX: CWP ) Fellow real estate sector stock Cedar Properties is also an ASX All Ords small-cap.  Tang explains his second ASX property stock pick:    CWP is a volume business and the demand for lots looks to be improving, with margins to invariably follow. CWP's exposure to lower priced stock in higher growth markets sees further potential to drive earnings.    On this basis, we see every reason for CWP to trade at NTA and potentially at a premium, were the housing cycle to gain steam through FY25/26.   The Cedar Woods share price closed yesterday at $4.60, down 1.71%, and is 7.8% lower in the year to date.  Coles Group Ltd ( ASX: COL ) A household name, Coles is an ASX All Ords  large-cap share  in the  consumer staples sector .  Tang says:   In our view, the ongoing scrutiny on the supermarkets has affected short term sentiment in the sector, which we believe creates a good buying opportunity in COL.    While Liquor sales remain soft, we expect the core Supermarkets division (~92% of earnings) to continue to be supported by further improvement in product availability, reduction in total loss, greater in-home consumption due to cost-of-living pressures, and population growth.   The Coles share price was $16.28, down 0.18% at the close yesterday and up 1.11% in the year to date."},

Here's why", "title_link": "https://www.fool.com.au/2024/05/10/the-qbe-share-price-is-marching-higher-on-friday-heres-why/", "published_date": "May 10, 2024", "publisher_name": "Bernd Struben", "Description": "The  QBE Insurance Group Ltd  ( ASX: QBE ) share price is marching higher today. Shares in the  S&P/ASX 200 Index  (ASX: XJO) insurance company closed yesterday trading for $17.59. At the time of writing in the early morning trade on Friday, shares are changing hands for $17.78 apiece, up 1.1%. For some context, the ASX 200 is 0.3% at this same time. This comes following the release of QBE's performance  update  for the first quarter of 2024 (Q1 2024). Here are the highlights. What did the ASX 200 insurer report? The QBE share price is marching higher after the company announced a 2% year on year increase in gross written premium for the three months in both a reported and constant currency terms. Renewal rate increases of 7.3% were in line with the company's expectations. Management said this \"reflected reduced rate increases across certain property and reinsurance lines compared to the prior corresponding period\". Excluding rate increases, premiums fell 2% in constant currency terms. This was due to lower Crop premium along with property portfolio exits in its North America and Australia operations. The ASX 200 insurer said it expects organic growth to partially offset the impact of lower commodity prices in its Crop segment. QBE forecasts Crop gross written premium will be around $3.9 billion in FY 2024. On the claims front, the company had a net cost of catastrophe claims of approximately $300 million in the four months to April. QBE's catastrophe allowance for 1H 2024 is $609 million. Management noted that catastrophe costs were driven by a number of storm events, mostly in Australia and North America. The QBE share price could also be getting some support with the ASX 200 insurer reporting that supportive interest rates and favourable returns in its risk asset portfolio delivered strong investment returns in Q1.  QBE's first quarter exit core fixed income running yield of 4.7% ticked up from the 4.6% FY 2023 exit running yield. Total investment funds under management (FUM) of $30.3 billion was up $200 million from FY 2023. Management said risk assets now accounted for some 15% of the portfolio. The company also noted that higher risk-free rates resulted in a $130 million unrealised loss on its core fixed income securities. Although this was broadly offset by the company's claims liability discount benefit. The final result was a neutral impact from QBE's asset-liability management activities for the quarter. As for what's ahead for QBE shares, management reaffirmed full-year guidance of constant currency gross written premium growth in the mid-single digits. Premium rate increases are expected to remain supportive. QBE's FY 2024 group combined operating ratio is forecast to be approximately 93.5%. The company is scheduled to release its first half results on 9 August. QBE share price snapshot The QBE share price has been a strong performer in 2024, up about 22% year to date."},

Just look at the chart below, IAG is up around 30% over the past year.  The business operates some of Australia's leading insurance brands including NRMA Insurance, CGU, Swann Insurance and WFI. The broker UBS recently lifted its forecasts for IAG shares to reflect a \"likely margin overshoot\" over the next 12 to 19 months. UBS thinks the market consensus' estimate that the profit margin will peak at 15.2% is \"on the low side\" for FY25 to FY26. UBS estimates the peak could be 16%. The current  share buyback  – which is around three-quarters complete – is \"also likely to support the stock into the FY24 results\". With that in mind, let's look at how much profit the business is predicted to make in the next few years. FY24 The 2024 financial year is nearly over, but we're still a few months away from learning how much profit the business has made for the full 12-month period to June 2024. UBS suggests IAG might make  net profit after tax (NPAT)  of $984 million in FY24, which would be an increase of around $150 million compared to  FY23 . The broker has forecast the  earnings per share (EPS)  could rise to 39 cents, up from 32 cents in FY23, which would be an increase of more than 20%. If that happens, it would put the IAG share price at 16x FY24's estimated earnings. FY25 The higher profit margin could lead to net profit rising again in the 2025 financial year, which could be beneficial for IAG shares. The forecast from UBS predicts IAG could generate net profit after tax of $1.05 billion in FY25, which would be an increase of around $60 million (or 6%). In EPS terms, IAG shares could see another 5% increase to 41 cents. This would put the IAG share price at 15x FY25's estimated earnings. FY26 The 2026 financial year could see another rise in profit, taking NPAT to $1.12 billion, which would be a year-over-year increase of 7.5%. IAG could see its EPS go up by another 4.9% to 43 cents. This would put the IAG share price at under 15x FY26's estimated earnings. Dividends Don't forget the business usually pays a decent  dividend  as well each year. UBS's projections suggest IAG could pay a  dividend yield  (excluding  franking credits ) of 3.7% in FY24, 4.6% in FY25 and 4.9% in FY26.  The market is sensing a better financial return from IAG shares (with the  market capitalisation 's rise), and if UBS is right then investors may still be underestimating the business."},

This has led to the S&P/ASX All Ordinaries Gold index rising by a sizeable 1.8% in morning trade. Two under-the-radar ASX gold shares that are rising more than most today are listed below. Let's see what is putting a rocket under their shares on Friday: Kingsgate Consolidated Limited  ( ASX: KCN ) The Kingsgate Consolidated share price is up over 11% to $1.76. Investors have been bidding this ASX gold share higher today in response to an  update  on its Chatree gold mine in Thailand. According to the release, Plant 1 at the gold mine has now been permitted to operate following a successful inspection by the Department of Primary Industries and Mines. The company advised that full commissioning of Plant 1 will commence immediately, followed by a ramp up to full operations. Kingsgate's managing director and CEO, Jamie Gibson, described this approval as an \"incredibly important milestone.\" He commented:   This is an incredibly important milestone for our company and represents the final piece in the puzzle in the journey to rebuild the Chatree Gold Mine. With both plants now operational, we are excited about unlocking Chatree's full potential.   Kingsgate Consolidated shares are now up 25% over the last 12 months. This would have turned a $10,000 investment one year ago into $12,500 today. Southern Cross Gold Ltd  ( ASX: SXG ) The Southern Cross Gold share price is up almost 14% to $3.05. Surprisingly, this is despite there being no news out of the Victorian Goldfields based gold explorer. However, it is worth noting that its shares have been on fire over the last 12 months amid excitement over the company's 100% owned flagship project at Sunday Creek. The company describes this as \"the best new grassroots discovery in Australia with a globally leading high-grade hit rate for this stage of the project's development.\" Excitement has been so high that the ASX gold share is now up 460% since this time last year. This would have turned a $10,000 investment into over $55,000 today. However, it is worth noting that there are a couple of leading brokers that appear to believe its shares are now fully valued. Shaw and Partners has a buy rating and $2.61 price target on its shares, whereas Bell Potter has a speculative hold rating and $2.05 on them."},

That's the view of analysts at Goldman Sachs, which see the ASX 200 tech stock as a great option right now. What is the broker saying about this ASX 200 tech stock? Ahead of the release of the enterprise software provider's half year result later this month, Goldman is predicting sales growth ahead of consensus estimates. It said:   We estimate TNE will report (1) SaaS ARR [annual recurring revenue] of A$425mn or +35% y/y vs +34% Visible Alpha Consensus Data; (2) Total revenue of A$241mn or +19% y/y vs A$231mn consensus; (3) Profit before tax of A$62mn or +18% y/y vs +19% consensus. We expect TNE to provide its typical +10-15% full-year PBT growth guidance, although based on recent strong ARR growth in combination with a small amount of margin leverage we expect TNE can comfortably exceed the top-end in November (GSe +16%).   Overall, the broker believes the ASX 200 stock is operating ahead of guidance and feels this isn't being reflected in its share price. It adds:   In our view TNE's above-trend ARR and earnings growth outlook, improved earnings visibility and upside levers to management targets (e.g. SaaS+, UK) are not being fully reflected in valuation. Execution on sustainable +115% NRR could help to close TNE's recent underperformance vs tech peers given 1H24 is the first result without a material sequential cloud flip tailwind (ie. substantially all growth will be underlying).   Decent upside predicted Today's note reveals that Goldman has reiterated its buy rating with a slightly improved price target of $18.10. Based on its current share price of $16.24, this implies potential upside of 11.5% for investors over the next 12 months. The broker also expects a modest 1.4% dividend yield to sweeten the deal further. But it may not stop there. In its bull case, Goldman sees scope for the ASX 200 tech stock to rise to $27.40, which is almost 70% higher than current levels. It explains:   We highlight our recent TNE bull case analysis of A$27.4 which factors in low-to-mid teens top line growth in ANZ (still assumes the 115% NRR target is not met), as well as a 30% revenue CAGR in the UK, where we ascribe A$21.3 to the ANZ business and A$6.1 for the UK. On this basis, market pricing (A$16.3) could be (1) implying that ANZ NRR decelerates materially below <115% in coming years and that TNE has little success in new product cross-sell; and (2) placing little value on UK, despite recent local government and higher ed customer wins."},

Three of the big four banks reported quarterly or half-year results over the week. And one traded  ex-dividend . Here's what happened. Three ASX 200 bank shares reporting results Westpac Banking Corp  ( ASX: WBC ) released its half-year earnings  results  on Monday. For the six months through 31 March, the ASX 200 bank share reported a 4% year-on-year decline in net operating income to $10.59 billion. And ongoing competition saw  net interest margins  (NIMs) come down 0.07% to 1.89%. With operating expenses up 8%, Westpac's net profit before one-offs was down 8% to $3.51 billion. But management pleased  passive income  investors by declaring a fully franked  dividend  of 90 cents per share. Westpac also announced an additional $1 billion on-market  share buyback . Westpac shares closed up 2.7% on Monday. On Tuesday, it was  Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd  ( ASX: ANZ ) that  reported  half-year results. As with Westpac, ANZ's NIM declined, though by a lesser 0.02%. The ASX 200 bank share's statutory profit after tax declined by 4% from the prior half to $3.41 billion, with cash profits dipping 1% to 3.55 billion. Management declared an interim dividend of 83 cents per share,  franked  at 65%. That's up from last year's interim dividend of 81 cents per share. And not to be outdone by Westpac, ANZ also announced a $2 billion on-market share buyback. ANZ shares closed up 0.1% on the day. Two days later, on Thursday,  Commonwealth Bank of Australia  ( ASX: CBA )  reported  its third-quarter update. Compared to the prior corresponding quarter, the ASX 200 bank share saw operating income slip by 1%, while operating expenses increased by 2%. As you'd expect, that led to lower profits for the three months, with unaudited statutory net profit after tax declining 5% year on year to $2.4 billion. CBA remains well-capitalised with a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 11.9%. That's a significant safety margin over the minimum 10.25% ratio required by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). And one trading ex-dividend National Australia Bank Ltd  ( ASX: NAB ) reported its half-year results on 2 May, a week earlier. As with the other ASX 200 bank shares, NAB's net operating income slipped year on year, down 0.9% to $10.14 billion. The big four bank's cash earnings declined by 12.8% to $3.55 billion. That didn't hold management back from declaring a fully franked dividend of 84 cents per share, up from 83 cents per share last year. NAB shares  traded  ex-dividend on Tuesday. As investors buying the ASX 200 bank share on Tuesday were no longer eligible for the upcoming dividend payment, the NAB share price closed the day down 1.5%."},

After taking a dip yesterday, the  ASX 200  was back to firing on all cylinders today. By the end of trade, the index had risen by a happy 0.35%, leaving it at 7,749 points as we head into the weekend.   This pleasant end to the week follows an equally bullish night of trade over in the United States last night.   The  Dow Jones Industrial Average Index  (DJX: .DJI) was in fine form, shooting up 0.85% overnight.   The  Nasdaq Composite Index  (NASDAQ: .IXIC) didn't far quite as well, but still banked a solid rise of 0.27%.   But getting back to the local markets, let's check out how the different  ASX sectors  dealt with today's broad-market optimism.   Winners and losers   There were far more smiles than frowns on the market today.   The worst performer was industrial shares though. The  S&P/ASX 200 Industrials Index  (ASX: XNJ) gave up an early lead to finish 0.14% lower by the conclusion of trading this Friday.   Also out in the cold were  consumer staples stocks.  The  S&P/ASX 200 Consumer Staples Index  (ASX: XSJ) ended up dipping by 0.13%.   Tech shares  were another mildly sore spot, as you can see from the  S&P/ASX 200 Information Technology Index  (ASX: XIJ)'s 0.07% slide.   Mining stocks  round out the red list. The  S&P/ASX 200 Materials Index  (ASX: XMJ) slipped by 0.06% over the day.   But that's it for the losers. Turning to the winners,  ASX energy shares  came out on top this Friday. The  S&P/ASX 200 Energy Index  (ASX: XEJ) were on fire, leaping 1.87% higher.   In second place, we had the  gold sector . The  All Ordinaries Gold Index  (ASX: XGD) vaulted 1.75% upwards by the close of trade.   Financial stocks  were hot, too, with the  S&P/ASX 200 Financials Index  (ASX: XFJ) banking a nice gain of 0.69%.   Communications shares  were also in demand. The  S&P/ASX 200 Communication Services  Index  (ASX: XTJ) dialled in a 0.65% rise.   Healthcare stocks  were revised today as well. The  S&P/ASX 200 Healthcare Index  (ASX: XHJ) got a 0.41% shot in the arm from investors.   Real estate investment trusts (REITs)  got a new lease on life. The  S&P/ASX 200 A-REIT Index  (ASX: XPJ) managed a 0.18% hike.   Consumer discretionary shares  got an invite to the ASX party, with the  S&P/ASX 200 Consumer Discretionary Index  (ASX: XDJ) swelling 0.12%.   Our final winner was the utilities space, evidenced by the  S&P/ASX 200 Utilities Index  (ASX: XUJ)'s 0.09% uptick.

In narrowing the field down to just two, I've limited myself to  S&P/ASX 200 Index  (ASX: XJO) dividend stocks. That's because the bigger companies tend to have less volatile share price moves. And their dividend payouts tend to be more reliable than some of their smaller peers. I've also drilled down to ASX 200 companies that pay fully  franked   dividends . This should see me holding onto more of my passive income at tax time. In the long term, those franking credits can make a particularly big difference in retirement. And while two stocks aren't enough to offer proper  diversification , I do want to ensure that both ASX 200 shares I'd buy now for passive income operate in distinctly  different markets . Finally, I need to keep in mind that future  yields  may be higher or lower than past yields, depending on a range of company-specific and macroeconomic factors. With that out of the way… Two ASX 200 stocks for outsized passive income The first company I'd buy now for passive income is ASX 200  mining stock   Fortescue Metals Group Ltd  ( ASX: FMG ). Fortescue enjoyed a strong first half of FY 2024. For the six months ending 31 December, the company reported a 41% year on year increase in net profit after tax ( NPAT ) to US$3.3 billion. In light of the profit surge, management boosted the interim dividend by 44% from the prior year to $1.08 per share. Eligible investors will have received that payout on 27 March. Fortescue also paid a final dividend of $1.00 per share on 28 September. That brings the full year's passive income payout from the ASX 200 miner to $2.08 per share. At Friday's closing price of $26.21 a share, this dividend gem trades on a fully franked trailing yield of 7.9%. Which brings us to the second company I'd buy now for outsized passive income, ASX 200  bank share   Westpac Banking Corp  ( ASX: WBC ). Westpac reported its half-year  results  this past week. Despite the big four bank's net profit before one-offs declining 8% year on year to $3.51 billion, management declared an interim dividend of 75 cents per share as well as a 15 cents per share special dividend, both fully franked. At 90 cents per share, that's up almost 29% from last year's interim dividend. This is the kind of growth I like to see. It's too late to snag that payout, but investors who owned shares at market close on Tuesday 7 May, can expect to be paid on 25 June. Westpac shares also delivered a final dividend of 72 cents a share, paid on 19 December. That brings the bank's full-year passive income payout to $1.62 a share. At Friday's closing price of $26.66, Westpac shares trade on a fully franked trailing yield of 5.5%."},

But investor and media interest in BHP shares ramped up to the next level on 26 April. That's when the miner  announced  it had made a non-binding offer to acquire  Anglo American  ( LSE: AAL ). The all scrip offer amounted to 31.1 billion British pounds, or roughly AU$60 billion. As you're likely aware, BHP is eyeing Anglo American with an eye on its copper assets. Copper represents 30% of Anglo American's total production. Should BHP's takeover succeed, the ASX 200 miner would become the world's top  copper producer , producing around 10% of global output. Amid growing demand and limited new supplies, the copper price has surged 16% year to date to US$9,905. And most analysts expect copper prices to continue trending higher from here. It's a markedly different story for iron ore, the top revenue earner for BHP shares. The iron ore price is down 16% in 2024 at US$116 per tonne, with many analysts forecasting it will trend lower from here. Take two? Now, as you're also likely aware, Anglo American's board rejected BHP's offer on 29 April. Anglo American chair, Stuart Chambers said the offer significantly undervalued the company and its future growth prospects. Rumour has it that BHP is likely to come back with an improved offer. The company has until 22 May to place a formal offer under UK acquisition regulations. But if you're buying BHP shares for the takeover potential, Aitken Mount Capital Partners stockbroker Angus Aitken cautioned the result could be a \"complete mess\". Why BHP shares could get walloped by the Anglo American takeover According to Aitken (courtesy of  The Australian Financial Review ), BHP is primarily  interested  in Anglo American's copper and coal assets. Meaning that it could look at selling numerous other projects, including the Barro Alto nickel mine in Brazil. And that could throw up some longer-term headwinds for BHP shares. According to Aitken:   In our view, this deal really does have the potential to be a complete mess for BHP long-term. This is like BHP is trying to buy a six-bedroom house, just to get the garage. There are multiple large risks in BHP long-term in trying to sell off the assets they don't want.   He added that this strategy \"seems crazy to us\". And the takeover proposal is far from simple. \"If you are a BHP shareholder and think this is a simple transaction, you have rocks in your head,\" he said. Aitken continued:   BHP are the single worst sellers of assets in the world with Rio Tinto a close second, and yet a lot of this potential deal involves BHP on-selling assets for good prices, and we are cautious on that. How are you going to get a full price for the assets they want to divest when everyone knows you are a non-natural owner of them?\"   Certainly, not everyone agrees with Aitken's bearish take on the proposed acquisition. Both Argo Investments and Wilson Asset Management believe the takeover can add value to BHP shares over time."}
