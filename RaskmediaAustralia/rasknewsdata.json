In Australia, it operates through its Realestate.com.au platform. REA Group operates on a global scale and now operates property websites in around 10 countries used by some 20,000 agents. In a typical month, the core Australian website gets over 55 million visits. The business is broken down across geographic lines, with Australia taking the lion’s share of revenue. Within Australia, REA makes money by listing properties for sale or rent (i.e. the agent uses REA’s website to show properties, which the property owner is on the hook to pay). It also makes money from financial services (e.g. mortgage broking), but this is a much smaller part of the business. Property websites such as Realestate.com.au attract both buyers and sellers and aim to simplify the process resulting in an efficient and stress-free transaction. We believe its competitive advantge is that of any other established platform: network effects and efficient scale. In other words, Domain (the #2 player) is meaningfully behind REA in users and views, which means REA can continue to charge more. BHP share price BHP Group (formerly BHP Billiton) is a diversified natural resources company producing commodities that was founded in 1885. BHP’s principal business lines are mineral exploration and production. BHP’s assets, operations and interests are separated into three focus areas: Copper and related minerals (e.g. gold, uranium, silver, zinc, etc.), Iron Ore, and Coal (i.e. metallurgical and energy). Share price valuation As a growth company, the way to put a rough guesstimate on the REA share price could be to compare its price-to-sales multiple over time. Currently, Rea Group Ltd shares have a price-sales ratio of 17.77x, which compares to its 5-year average of 12.29x, meaning its shares are trading higher than their historical average. Please keep in mind that context is important – and this is just one valuation technique. I wouldn’t make a decision based on one metric. Since it is a more mature-style business, the BHP share price is offering a historical dividend yield of around 6.08%, which compares to its 5-year average of 9.38%. The Rask websites, especially our Rask Education platform, offer free tutorials explaining Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). Both of these models would be a better way to value the BHP share price. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio. Imagine earning 4%, 5% — or more — in dividend passive income from the best shares, LICs, or ETFs… it’s like magic. So how do the best investors do it? Chief Investment Officer Owen Rask has just released his brand new passive income report . Owen has outlined 10 of his favourite ETFs and shares to watch, his rules for passive income investing, why he would buy ETFs before LICs and more.

{"source_name": "RaskMedia", "title": "Looking for an ASX blue chip share? Try the Coles Group Ltd (ASX:COL) share price", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/05/11/looking-for-an-asx-blue-chip-share-try-the-coles-group-ltd-asxcol-share-price-11/", "publisher_name": "Rask ASX News Team", "published_date": "May 11, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu COL share price Coles is an Australian retailer providing customers with everyday products including fresh food, groceries, general merchandise, liquor, fuel and financial services. It was founded in 1914 in Victoria, where its HQ still remain. Coles was formerly owned by conglomerate Wesfarmers from 2007 until 2018, when it was spun-off and listed as a separate entity on the ASX under the ticker symbol ‘COL’. Coles’ earnings are dominated by the supermarkets side of the business, however, it partly or fully owns or operates adjacent businesses like flybuys, Liquorland, First Choice, Vintage Cellars, Coles Express and more. Every week millions of Australians choose to shop for essential food and drink at Coles because of its prices, range and location. While it is the smaller brother of Woolworths, which has nearly 40% market share, Coles isn’t too far behind, with about 28%. PLS share price Pilbara Minerals is a leading ASX-listed lithium company, owning 100% of the world’s largest, independent hard-rock lithium operation, Pilgangoora, which it acquired in 2014. Pilbara’s primary business is to, put simply, find, dig up and sell spodumene concentrate. It sells its concentrate through “offtake” agreements and spot sales on the Battery Material Exchange (BMX) platform. A good example of an offtake partner is Great Wall (the Chinese car company) or POSCO, a South Korean company. Pilbara has overcome significant hurdles to become a leader in lithium mining in Australia. However, as a commodities producer, its revenue is still at the mercy of (sometimes dramatic) fluctuations in the price of spodumene in the global market. Even still, bulls would say it’s a ‘pure play’ investment on demand for electric vehicles and battery tech. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘speedy read’ of where the COL share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, Coles Group Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 4.06%, which compares to its 5-year average of 3.82%. Put simply, COL shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield. The PLS share price trades at a price-sales ratio of 3.07x, which compares to its 5-year long-term average of 6.53x. So, PLS shares are trading below their historical average. However, please do more investigating than a simple multiple like this. Our websites explain Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Dividend Discount Models (DDM), and many different ways to value a share, like Pilbara Minerals Ltd. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

This business is an online retailer of furniture and homewares. It also has relatively small but growing trade & commercial and home improvement divisions. Temple & Webster sales update The e-commerce business said trading remained strong over the half, with sales between 1 January to 5 May up 30% year on year. Growth is being driven by both repeat and first-time customers. It revealed that products exclusive to Temple & Webster are now generating 41% of revenue and make up 70% of its top 500 selling products. Perhaps unsurprisingly in the current economic environment, lower discretionary categories such as bedroom furniture, sofa and outdoor furniture continue to outperform higher discretionary categories. The company reported its suite of internal AI solutions are delivering conversion rate increases of more than 10% and are now handling around 40% of all customer interactions. This technological change could help the Temple & Webster share price if it leads to a better cost profile. The trade & commercials and home improvement growth initiatives have both delivered growth in the half to date of more than 30%. The full-year EBITDA margin guidance range of between 1% to 3% was confirmed. Its balance sheet remains in a good position, with the business reporting it had cash of more than $100 million and no debt. Management commentary The Temple & Webster CEO Mark Coulter said: Temple & Webster continues to deliver on its customer promise of delivering beautiful products at outstanding value. This proposition is clearly resonating with shoppers who continue to take advantage of the value that online shopping can deliver. While the overall furniture and homewares market is down 4% HTD (half to date) due to cost-of-living pressures, our strong growth highlights the significant market share gains we are making. We reiterate our EBITDA guidance of 1-3%, targeting the mid-point of the range as we continue to invest in growing our market share and delivering on our key growth pillars. Final thoughts on the Temple & Webster share price The online retailer continues to do very well at maximising its market share and growing sales, while remaining slightly profitable. The market was clearly expecting even more after a rise of 60% over the past six months and around 170% in the last year. It had probably gotten a bit too far ahead of itself in the short-term. In five years, I think the business is likely to be generating much stronger revenue – it wasn’t a bad update at all. In-fact, I’d say 30% growth was very good considering some retailers are struggling to generate any growth right now. But, due to the current valuation, I’d rather invest in other ASX growth shares . With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

Suncorp is best known for its insurance operations with brands like AAMI, Bingle, Apia, GIO, Vero, Teri Scheer and Shannons. Suncorp Bank is another part of the business which is expected to be acquired by ANZ Group Holdings Ltd ( ASX: ANZ ). Suncorp Bank update It revealed that its home lending portfolio increased faster than the Australian loan system in the March quarter, seeing an increase of $803 million, or 1.4% (which Suncorp said was 5.8% annualised). Suncorp said the continued growth was driven by a “positive net refinance rate, improved conversion rate and strong service levels, including turnaround times and continual improvements in customer and broker experiences.” The ASX financial share said it’s remaining focused on balancing growth and profit margins, while optimising risk-adjusted returns for investors. Suncorp claimed that its home lending portfolio is high-quality and conservatively positioned, weighted towards owner occupiers, on principal and interest repayment terms and loans with a loan-to-value ratio (LVR) below 80%. Suncorp revealed business lending grew $69 million, or 0.6% (which Suncorp said was 2.2% annualised). The agribusiness portfolio grew $152 million, supported by seasonal conditions. This was partly offset by a contraction in the commercial real estate portfolio of $83 million, largely because of “heightened external refinances in the beginning of the quarter, and from intense competition in the sector given the low system credit growth.” Lending growth is generally a good thing for Suncorp shares, as long as arrears aren’t increasing. The small and medium business portfolio remained “relatively flat, reflect lower new business volumes”. Suncorp Bank grew its retail term deposits by an annualised rate of 34.8% and the savings account balances increased by an annualised 3.9%. Household deposits saw a period of “intense competition” as customers became “increasingly responsive to higher interest products”. The net impairment expense was just $1 million for the quarter, reflecting a “benign credit experience, minimal write-offs and an unchanged collective provision.” Despite that positive commentary, the total of loans past due by at least 90 days increased by $85 million to $510 million, which was up 11 basis points (0.11%) of gross loans and advances from the previous quarter. The increase was mainly drive by a $54 million increase in the home lending portfolio and a $31 million increase across all business lending portfolios. The amount of retail loans past due, excluding 90+ days overdue, increased to $375 million at March 2024, up from $321 million at December 2023 and $260 million at March 2023. That’s a year on year increase of 44.2%. It seems the situation is steadily worsening for Suncorp’s loan book, which isn’t helpful for Suncorp shares. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

It is currently the Australia’s largest company in terms of revenue and market share. Woolworths’ main operations include supermarkets (under the Woolworths brand in Australia and Countdown in New Zealand), retailing through its discount department stores under the Big W brand, and business-to-business (B2B) brands like PFD. Overwhelmingly, it’s 35%+ share of Australian supermarkets is its crown jewel. Woolworths is a very popular choice for many ASX investors seeking dividend income. It consistently pays a fully franked dividend, usually at a yield of over 3%, and offers a very defensive earnings stream. It’s competitive advantage is probably best summarised as scale (distribution, low costs, etc.) and proximity (most shoppers still shop based on distance to the supermarket). CSL share price CSL is a global biotechnology company that develops and delivers innovative medicines that save lives, protect public health and help people with life-threatening medical conditions live full lives. The company is divided into three main business units: CSL Behring, CSL Seqirus and CSL Vifor. Behring, acquired in 2004, manufactures and distributes blood plasma products. Seqirus was formed by a rebranding of BioCSL and the acquired Novartis flu business (bought in 2015) makes flu-related products and performs pandemic-related services for Governments. Finally, Vifor makes products for iron deficiency and nephrology (renal/kidney care). As previously mentioned, CSL’s plasma collection unit creates life-saving treatments for those will serious illnesses globally. CSL relies on plasma and blood collections to perform its primary businesses; and acquisitions are increasingly part of the CSL business. Investors often use CSL as an indirect play on rising spending on healthcare. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘fast read’ of where the WOW share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, Woolworths Group Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 3.36%, which compares to its 5-year average of 2.66%. Put simply, WOW shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield. Since it is a more mature-style business, the CSL share price is offering a historical dividend yield of around 1.29%, which compares to its 5-year average of 1.24%. The Rask websites, especially our Rask Education platform, offer free tutorials explaining Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). Both of these models would be a better way to value the CSL share price. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

{"source_name": "RaskMedia", "title": "The Wesfarmers Ltd (ASX:WES) share price and Rea Group Ltd (ASX:REA) share price are worth watching", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/05/10/the-wesfarmers-ltd-asxwes-share-price-and-rea-group-ltd-asxrea-share-price-are-worth-watching-11/", "publisher_name": "Rask ASX News Team", "published_date": "May 10, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu WES share price Founded in 1914, Wesfarmers is an Australian conglomerate headquartered in Perth. It mainly has operations across Australia and New Zealand, operating in retail, chemical, fertiliser, industrial and safety products. It’s easy to think of Wesfarmers like a publicly listed private equity company. It has a long history of buying businesses, benefitting from their cash flows, re-investing in them and then selling them for a more attractive price. A good example of this might be Coles Group, which is bought in 2007 and spun out in 2018. However, by far (over 50%) of the company’s operating profit comes from Bunnings, the #1 hardware and home improvement business in Australia. It bought the remaining 52% of Bunnings that it didn’t own in 1994 for $594 million. Other brands include Kmart, Target, Officeworks, Blackwoods and Priceline Pharmacy. Wesfarmers has long been considered a leading blue chip stock for the average ASX share portfolio. Wesfarmers has quality assets such as Bunnings, Kmart and Officeworks and pays a consistent dividend to its shareholders. Since we consider Wesfarmers Ltd to be a blue chip stock, or a mature business, we like to look at things like return on invested capital (ROIC) and revenue growth as signs of sustainability. In FY23, Wesfarmers Ltd had an ROIC of 19.00% and revenue has compounded at 12.2% in recent years. Anything over 10% ROIC is pretty strong for a mature-style business, since its cost of capital is likely below that level, so Wesfarmers Ltd crosses this hurdle. REA share price Founded in 1995, REA Group is a Melbourne-based real estate advertising company that is majority owned by News Corp. In Australia, it operates through its Realestate.com.au platform. REA Group operates on a global scale and now operates property websites in around 10 countries used by some 20,000 agents. In a typical month, the core Australian website gets over 55 million visits. The business is broken down across geographic lines, with Australia taking the lion’s share of revenue. Within Australia, REA makes money by listing properties for sale or rent (i.e. the agent uses REA’s website to show properties, which the property owner is on the hook to pay). It also makes money from financial services (e.g. mortgage broking), but this is a much smaller part of the business. Property websites such as Realestate.com.au attract both buyers and sellers and aim to simplify the process resulting in an efficient and stress-free transaction. We believe its competitive advantge is that of any other established platform: network effects and efficient scale. In other words, Domain (the #2 player) is meaningfully behind REA in users and views, which means REA can continue to charge more. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘speedy read’ of where the WES share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, Wesfarmers Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 2.81%, which compares to its 5-year average of 3.84%. Put simply, WES shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield. The REA share price trades at a price-sales ratio of 17.53x, which compares to its 5-year long-term average of 12.29x. So, its shares are trading higher than their historical average. However, please do more investigating than a simple multiple like this. Our websites explain Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Dividend Discount Models (DDM), and many different ways to value a share, like Rea Group Ltd. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio. Imagine earning 4%, 5% — or more — in dividend passive income from the best shares, LICs, or ETFs… it’s like magic. So how do the best investors do it?

Life360 provides an app for families to track the location of other people in the family, it provides reports of whether drivers are being safe, and it has “crash detection with emergency dispatch” capabilities. March 2024 quarter Life360 reported its first quarter revenue increased by 15% to $78.2 million, which was a year over year increase of 15%. Total subscription revenue rose 91% to $61.6 million and ‘core subscription’ revenue went up 19% year on year to $57 million. The ASX tech share revealed its annualised monthly revenue (AMR) went up 19% year on year to $284.7 million. Life360 reported positive adjusted EBITDA of $4.3 million, though the late Charline Munger wouldn’t have liked that metric. Its actual EBITDA was a loss of $4.1 million. In the first quarter of 2023, it made $0.5 million of adjusted EBITDA and an EBITDA loss of $12.6 million. Cashflow continues to improve for the business. It revealed positive operating cashflow of $10.7 million for the March 2024 quarter, which was a year-on-year improvement of $19.9 million. This could help the Life360 share price if cashflow keeps rising. Life360 revealed its cash position finished the March quarter at $74.6 million, an increase of $3.9 million from the fourth quarter of 2023. In terms of monthly active users (MAU), there was a global increase of 4.9 million, which saw a 31% year on year increase to approximately 66.4 million. It talked of “significant momentum, particularly in a seasonally lower period for MAU growth.” Global ‘paying circle’ net additions amounted to 96,000, which was a record for the first quarter. This led to a 21% increase year on year to 1.9 million, supported by “improved conversion and retention.” Interestingly, the business reported that the net hardware units that were shipped fell by 6% year on year to 0.5 million, while the average selling price declined 4% year on year to $16.50. Outlook for the Life360 share price The company said it was maintaining its 2024 guidance, with revenue projected to be between $365 million to $375 million, while adjusted EBITDA is projected to be between $30 million to $35 million. The EBITDA loss is expected to be between $8 million to $13 million in 2024, while the cash balance is projected to be between $80 million to $90 million. It’s still growing revenue at a good pace, but it seems the update wasn’t as good as some investors were expecting. But, with the Life360 share price up 150% in the last year, I wouldn’t say it’s cheap even after this decline. There are other ASX growth shares I’d rather buy. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

Zip offers buy now, pay later services , with its core markets being the US and Canada, as well as Australia and New Zealand. March 2024 quarter highlights Zip reported that it generated underlying group cash EBTDA (which is the EBITDA acronym without the I – interest) of $20.1 million. It reported transaction volume of $2.4 billion for the quarter, which was an increase of 14.6% (though transaction numbers were flat), while revenue rose by 26.6% year on year to $219.2 million. These are solid numbers to help push the Zip share price higher. However, quarter on quarter, total revenue was down 2.1%. Impressively, Zip’s revenue margin improved to 9.1%, up from 8.3% in the third quarter of FY23. The cash transaction margin saw a huge increase to 3.9% for the latest quarter, up from 2.9% in the FY23 third quarter. The active customer number reached 6 million at the end of the March 2024 quarter, with the number of merchants increasing 9.1% year on year to 77,700. The ASX share revealed Zip Americas delivered a “particularly strong” total transaction value (TTV) performance of US$1.06 billion (up 43.6%) and revenue of US$75.3 million (up 49.2%). The US bad debts continued to perform “well” with the monthly cohort loss rates of approximately 1.3% of TTV. ANZ net bad debts were 3.49% of TTV at 31 March 2024, compared to 3.64% at 31 December 2023. As a group, the net bad debt was 1.72% in the third quarter of FY24, an improvement from 1.89% in the third quarter of FY23 and 1.74% in the FY24 second quarter. Improvements could be essential to give investors confidence about the Zip share price. Management commentary The Zip CEO and Managing Director Cynthia Scott said: During the quarter, Zip continued to focus on product innovation and delivering great customer and merchant outcomes. In the US, our collaboration with Google Pay experienced positive momentum continuing to scale. In Australia, we have seen strong customer engagement and unit economics with our new product, Zip Plus. We welcomed new merchants to the Zip platform including Vallarta and Follett in the US, Temu in ANZ, and Wynstan in AU and have a strong pipeline of merchants. In driving operational excellence, Zip recently successfully financed approximately $1.1bn of receivables funding. During the quarter, Zip refinanced its AU receivables variable funding facility and subsequent to quarter end, Zip also completed a new warehouse and a $300.0m rated note issuance. Support from existing and new investors was strong and these financing initiatives have provided Zip with ample headroom to support future growth in the Australian business. We further strengthened our balance sheet with the outstanding face value of the Senior Convertible Notes reducing to $21.7m and available cash and liquidity improving to $95.2m. Final thoughts on Zip shares The Zip share price is up more than 4% in response to this update, which isn’t surprising considering its margins improved and revenue growth was strong. Can Zip keep growing its revenue and profitability at the same time that its revenue margin is so high (and keeps increasing)? Time will tell. The Zip market capitalisation is very high, so the market is expecting a lot. For now, there are other ASX growth shares I’d rather look at.

Pilbara’s primary business is to, put simply, find, dig up and sell spodumene concentrate. It sells its concentrate through “offtake” agreements and spot sales on the Battery Material Exchange (BMX) platform. A good example of an offtake partner is Great Wall (the Chinese car company) or POSCO, a South Korean company. Pilbara has overcome significant hurdles to become a leader in lithium mining in Australia. However, as a commodities producer, its revenue is still at the mercy of (sometimes dramatic) fluctuations in the price of spodumene in the global market. Even still, bulls would say it’s a ‘pure play’ investment on demand for electric vehicles and battery tech. SOL share price Founded in 1903, Washington H. Soul Pattinson (WHSP) is an investment company with a diversified portfolio of assets across a range of industries and asset classes. Some of SOL’s largest holdings include stakes in other well-known publicly listed companies such as TPG Telecom ( ASX: TPG ), New Hope Group ( ASX: NHC ) and a cross shareholding in Brickworks ( ASX: BKW ). SOL’s mission is to deliver superior returns to its shareholders by creating capital growth and steadily increasing dividends as a holding company. It’s the second-oldest publicly listed company on the ASX and has a strong track record of capital growth and dividends. It should be thought of as family-run LIC, for the benefit of all shareholders (who are deeply aligned). Share price valuation As a growth company, the way to put a broad estimate on the PLS share price could be to compare its price-to-sales multiple over time. Currently, Pilbara Minerals Ltd shares have a price-sales ratio of 2.93x, which compares to its 5-year average of 6.53x, meaning its shares are trading below their historical average. Please keep in mind that context is important – and this is just one valuation technique. I wouldn’t make a decision based on one metric. Since it is a more mature-style business, the SOL share price is offering a historical dividend yield of around 2.73%, which compares to its 5-year average of 2.54%. The Rask websites, especially our Rask Education platform, offer free tutorials explaining Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). Both of these models would be a better way to value the SOL share price. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

{"source_name": "RaskMedia", "title": "5% passive income: How to build a reliable retirement portfolio", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/04/15/etf-passive-income-retirement/", "publisher_name": "Owen Raszkiewicz", "published_date": "April 15, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu One of the more interesting questions I’ve fielded a few times this past month is, ‘what level of passive income can I get from a good stock market portfolio?’ As Charlie Munger might have said, let’s start with what we should avoid… With interest rates, land tax, strict tenancy laws, maintenance, vacancy tax, regular income tax and political scrutiny… … it’s fair to say, relying on property to generate passive income (pre or post retirement) could be a very bad idea. And, fortunately… I have some really good news for passive income investors. In the past 10 years, there’s probably never been a better time to earn passive income from… everything but property! For example, right now, a boring Government bond ETF like the iShares IAF ETF can yield 3% (or more). A few years ago, that was not a good option (in my opinion). Global X’s US Treasury Bond ETF ( ASX: USTB ) is yielding 4.5% for lending to the US Government. (Note: Global X is a long-term sponsor of a Rask podcast. We’re not paid by them to write this.) A term deposit from Mr Lion ( ING ) or the Silver Donut ( Macquarie ) will you pay nearly 5% – with virtually no risk given the Government guarantee. A few years ago, I would salivate for 1.5%. Heck, even a vanilla Australian shares ETF like Vanguard’s most popular Vanguard Australian Shares Index ETF ( ASX: VAS ) or BetaShares Australia 200 ETF (ASX: A200) will pay nearly 4%. Chuck in the franking credits that’ll pass through them, and it could be pouring out 5% of income while you sleep! (Note: Betashares is a long-term sponsor of a Rask podcast. We’re not paid by them to write this.) The thing is, dividends from shares are not guaranteed (like a term deposit). However, using a good ETF will be much more consistent than owning single stocks – thanks to the power of diversification. The chart above shows you that adding more ‘different types of stocks’ will lower your overall portfolio risk. Meaning, if you’re chasing income – don’t get yourself into a position where you rely on one stock or type of asset [e.g. BHP Group Ltd ( ASX: BHP ), Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA), etc.]. The anxiety about an upcoming dividend decision is real. Loosely speaking, by using a truly diversified ETF, you can ‘instantly’ move your risk profile down to the bottom line “market risk”. For example, if BHP or Fortescue Ltd ( ASX: FMG ) cuts its dividends this year, you can rest assured because there are 298 other stocks inside the Vanguard VAS ETF. However, your ETF will still move up and down, as the overall market moves (hence “market risk”). But you shouldn’t suffer completely from any one stock going really bad (e.g. iron ore prices falling). Now imagine you ALSO throw in more than one ETF, from more than one sector (e.g. Australian shares ETF, bonds ETF, cash ETF, etc.), from more than one geography (Australia, US, global), from more than one issuer (Vanguard, Betashares, iShares, Global X, VanEck, etc.). This is special. Finally, an added bonus of using ETFs instead of property for income in retirement is that, if an ETF investor needed to top up his or her income, she wouldn’t need to sell half the bathroom or all of the ensuite to pay for a new car or a holiday or family emergency. She would simply sell part of her ETF holding and have the money ready in a few days! All up, I believe even the most basic (but good) retirement ETF portfolio – with only 50% in ‘growth’ assets like shares and the other 50% in defensive assets like bonds and cash – can yield close to 3.5%. But… (and it’s a big BUT ) … in addition to the income, your portfolio should grow over the long run. Not every year, but over 10+ years. That’s the beauty of a diversified portfolio, with ETFs inside of it. Please Sir, can I have some more? However, let’s say you’re not scared to go beyond the vanilla flavours. If you told me to get a tiny bit more creative, I reckon I can move an ETF portfolio towards 5% of income, with franking credits sprinkled on top . Simply stir in a good dividend ETF (one that pays franking credits), add a pinch of a credit ETF [e.g. VanEck Australian Subordinated Debt ETF (ASX: SUBD)], then bring the portfolio slightly back to Australian shares (for more franking). Delicious, tax-effective, passive income, via a low-cost ETF portfolio… no land tax in sight! But Owen, what happens when interest rates fall? If interest rates fall – ideally before they fall – a good investor would tweak their portfolio to benefit. A common misconception is that when the stock/property/bond market crashes, all wealth disappears. That’s not how it works. As least, not if you’re invested in a truly diversified portfolio and have a plan. You may actually benefit from changes in the economic environment. For example… By locking in some term deposits with different maturities (instead of keeping cash parked in one savings accounts), adding some Government bonds (which should go up as interest rates fall) and diversifying across different types of shares and currencies, we can build an ‘all weather’ portfolio. This means, the portfolio’s value might go up when interest rates fall – and you may be able to preserve some of your passive income stream. At least for a little while. Bottom line The bottom line to my email is pretty darn good news for investors who have a focus on Super, an SMSF, or for those thinking of reducing their exposure to property to get true passive income . Right now, the yields on offer for truly diversified portfolio are some of the best I’ve seen in the past 10 years. On top of that, I think it’s never been easier to invest in a portfolio of ETFs and get professional guidance while you do it. This is why I designed the Rask Terra retirement portfolio the way I did. (Please note: There are many reasons I see ETFs and the stock market playing a bigger role in my own portfolio. Many of which I first laid out, in detail, many years ago in the Rask philosophy and 10 rules of wealth . Or, more recently, in the article, ‘ where I’m invested and how it’ll change .’) P.S. if you plan to invest with us, you can book a call with our team . With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

Plenty of investors may already own the big banks or big miners, so I’m going to talk about two other large ASX shares that could offer even more resilient income. Telstra Group Ltd (ASX: TLS) We all use the internet, and Telstra is one of the key businesses providing a gateway to entertainment, education, work, communication, banking, shopping, connecting with government services and so on. I think the amount of devices in Australia connected to the internet is only going to increase from here, which is a very positive tailwind for the company’s subscription numbers and future profit-making. The ASX blue-chip share is hoping to keep growing its dividend and that’s exactly what is happening at the moment. Its 2024 financial year interim dividend was hiked by 5.9%, taking the annualised dividend yield to 4.8%, or 6.9% including the franking credits . I believe the business can keep growing its profit and dividend in the next few years, with its improving 5G network. The number of people in Australia continues to grow, which helps increase the potential demand for Telstra. Coles Group Ltd (ASX: COL) We all need to eat food, so a supermarket business could be a very useful investment for people hoping for quite dependable earnings and a resilient dividend. The inflation situation has made it a tricky operating environment for Coles, but conditions seem to be improving and Coles’ trading update for the first few weeks of the 2024 calendar year was promising – it grew sales faster than Woolworths Group Ltd ( ASX: WOW ). The ASX blue-chip share hasn’t been listed on the ASX for that long, but it has created a track record of regularly growing its dividend payment. It’s not clear that there will be dividend growth in FY24, but the current yield translates into a dividend yield of 4.1%, or 5.8% with the franking credits. The business is working on a number of initiatives including to be more sustainable and also to have more a more automated logistics network, which can help efficiencies and margins. This could help grow the Coles dividend in future years. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

When the team made the decision to invest in Agilent Technologies Inc ( NYSE: A ) back in 2020, this meticulous approach was really put to the test. Among other investment opportunities within the sector, Agilent Technologies, a prominent player in life science tools, diagnostics and applied markets emerged as a compelling choice due to its robust fundamentals. With a market capitalisation of approximately $US43 billion ($A66 billion), the business boasts a balanced geographical presence split 38 per cent in the Americas, 37 per cent in Asia Pacific and 25 per cent in Europe. The life sciences firm offers a diverse suite of instruments, consumables and services that assist over 265,000 labs across the world conduct anything from early-stage research through to late-stage quality control and assurance. Acknowledging the competitive landscape emerging in the life sciences and diagnostics sector, we remain confident in Agilent’s ability to maintain its competitive edge through an ongoing focus on product innovation, high-end services and helping connect workflows throughout the lab. Despite the sector’s susceptibility to capital budget cycles within the pharmaceutical sector, the replacement cycle nature of the business where customers cannot delay purchases for too long, instils further confidence in its resilience through the cycle. With around 20 per cent of its revenue generated in China – in 2011, it became the first country outside the US to generate more than $US1 billion in annual revenue for Agilent – concerns have been raised about that country’s slowing economy and the associated lack of stimulus flowing into the life sciences sector. From our perspective, we still expect high-single-digit growth in China, as well as being reassured by the company’s 30-year history in the region where they have over 2,000 local service employees and an expanded manufacturing footprint in Shanghai. Beyond financial metrics, Claremont Global’s investment decision was also formed on the basis of a range of qualitative factors. The calibre of its management and the inclusive workplace culture that is embedded across the organisation were telling factors. President and CEO, Mike McMullen , who took the reins in March 2015 will step down on 30 April, after driving tangible cultural change through the company’s One Agilent while also pivoting the company into faster growing, higher margin verticals. Under his tenure, the business grew organic revenues at close to 7%, operating margins rose over 700 basis points, with the market cap more than trebling, leading to significant gains for shareholders. The executive stepping into his shoes is Padraig McDonnell , previously President of Agilent’s service organisation or CrossLab Group . Like McMullen, who spent nearly 40 years with Agilent and its predecessor HP Inc ( NYSE: HPQ ), McDonnell, who will only be Agilent’s fourth CEO, comes to the role with a long and successful career in the analytical instruments industry since starting at Hewlett-Packard in 1998. It is both the common commercial knowledge shared between these two senior leaders as well as having a successor who is steeped in the corporate culture that is very reassuring to an investor. None of this is to argue it will be smooth sailing for Agilent. The capex budget pressures seen across the pharmaceutical industry over the last 12-18 months is evidence of this. However, Agilent’s proven and growing footprint in life sciences, diagnostics and applied markets, reinforced by a strategic focus on innovation and a committed management team, should ensure it continues to deliver to value for its shareholders.

{"source_name": "RaskMedia", "title": "REA and BHP Group Ltd: 2 ASX shares to dig into", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/04/14/rea-and-bhp-group-ltd-2-asx-shares-to-dig-into-8/", "publisher_name": "Rask ASX News Team", "published_date": "April 14, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu REA share price Founded in 1995, REA Group is a Melbourne-based real estate advertising company that is majority owned by News Corp. In Australia, it operates through its Realestate.com.au platform. REA Group operates on a global scale and now operates property websites in around 10 countries used by some 20,000 agents. In a typical month, the core Australian website gets over 55 million visits. The business is broken down across geographic lines, with Australia taking the lion’s share of revenue. Within Australia, REA makes money by listing properties for sale or rent (i.e. the agent uses REA’s website to show properties, which the property owner is on the hook to pay). It also makes money from financial services (e.g. mortgage broking), but this is a much smaller part of the business. Property websites such as Realestate.com.au attract both buyers and sellers and aim to simplify the process resulting in an efficient and stress-free transaction. We believe its competitive advantge is that of any other established platform: network effects and efficient scale. In other words, Domain (the #2 player) is meaningfully behind REA in users and views, which means REA can continue to charge more. BHP share price BHP Group (formerly BHP Billiton) is a diversified natural resources company producing commodities that was founded in 1885. BHP’s principal business lines are mineral exploration and production. BHP’s assets, operations and interests are separated into three focus areas: Copper and related minerals (e.g. gold, uranium, silver, zinc, etc.), Iron Ore, and Coal (i.e. metallurgical and energy). Share price valuation As a growth company, the way to put a rough guesstimate on the REA share price could be to compare its price-to-sales multiple over time. Currently, Rea Group Ltd shares have a price-sales ratio of 16.99x, which compares to its 5-year average of 12.29x, meaning its shares are trading higher than their historical average. Please keep in mind that context is important – and this is just one valuation technique. I wouldn’t make a decision based on one metric. Since it is a more mature-style business, the BHP share price is offering a historical dividend yield of around 5.73%, which compares to its 5-year average of 9.38%. The Rask websites, especially our Rask Education platform, offer free tutorials explaining Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). Both of these models would be a better way to value the BHP share price. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

{"source_name": "RaskMedia", "title": "Tit for tat?", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/04/16/tit-for-tat-market-update/", "publisher_name": "David Bassanese", "published_date": "April 16, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu Global markets – week in review Rising Middle East tensions, a higher-than-expected US CPI report, and a soft start to the US earnings reporting season conspired to push US equities down for the second week in a row. Bond yields and the $US rose as US rate cut expectations were pushed back further. The market now expects no more than two US rate cuts later this year. Prior to Friday’s reports that Iran was planning an attack on Israel, the major global highlight last week was the slightly hotter-than-expected March US CPI report. Both headline and core inflation rose 0.4% in the month, compared to market expectations for a 0.3% gain in both. It was the third month in a row that the US CPI has surprised on the upside – in part because the imputed rent on owner-occupied housing (yes it is an actual element of the CPI!) is not easing as much as estimates of private rents on new leases usually suggests. Strong gains in car insurance, reflecting the lagged impact of COVID-related car price increases, is not helping. Irrespective of the cause, the fact remains that the US economy remains in surprisingly rude health which is perhaps contributing to inflation being a little stickier than expected. The market has rightly scaled back mid-year rate cut expectations and, especially given stretched valuations, Wall Street remains vulnerable to a deeper correction if the bad run on inflation continues and/or the Fed starts to sound more hawkish. We can now throw into the mix the upsurge in Middle East tensions. From a markets perspective, the main risk is a resumption of oil export sanctions on Iran which could further drive up oil prices, inflation and bond yields. The question now is whether the tit-for-tat between Israel and Iran continues. For its part Iran has signalled it does not want escalation, indicating its weekend attack was in retaliation for Israel’s attack in Syria (which killed a top Iranian military commander) and that “the matter can be deemed concluded”. We’ll soon see if Israel agrees. Last Friday also saw the start of the US Q1 earnings reporting season , with less than impressive results for JPMorgan Chase & Co ( NYSE: JPM ), Citigroup Inc ( NYSE: C ) and Wells Fargo & Co ( NYSE: WFC ) further dragging on the market. The week ahead With little in the way of major US data this week, the focus is likely to remain on Middle East tensions (especially Israel’s response – or lack thereof – to the Iran attack). Corporate earnings will also be in focus, with results from Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( NYSE: GS ) and Netflix Inc ( NASDAQ: NFLX ) among a swag of reports due this week. Global equity trends Looking at global equity trends, the rebound in bond yields is helping drag back the relative performance of growth over value, as evident in the pullback in Nasdaq-100 (INDEXNASDAQ: NDX) relative performance. Japan and Europe are also faring better, while Australia and emerging markets less so. Australian markets Despite rising bond yields, the S&P/ASX 200 ( INDEXASX: XJO ) held up reasonably well last week, with a 0.2% gain after a 1.6% decline the previous week. That said, Friday’s Wall Street weakness and Iran’s weekend attack on Israel will likely drag on the market this morning. The $A remains on the back foot, given a strong US economy, soggy iron-ore prices and heightened geo-political risk. The local highlights data-wise last week were the continued dichotomy between firm business conditions and confidence in the National Australia Bank Ltd ( ASX: NAB ) business survey and weak consumer confidence in the Westpac Banking Corp ( ASX: WBC )/Melbourne Institute consumer survey. The split highlights the fact that spending by domestic residents has taken the biggest hit from higher RBA rates and inflation thus far – and, so far at least, this has not bled into weaker business sentiment due to healthy levels of non-residential construction activity and higher immigration. The key local highlight this week will be Thursday’s March labour force report – which follow’s February blockbuster report in which employment surged by 100k and the unemployment rate dropped from 4.1% to 3.7%. Although this week’s report is unlikely to be as strong (how could it be!), even a modest rise in unemployment and small corrective decline in employment would leave the labour market looking fairly tight.

The company is divided into three main business units: CSL Behring, CSL Seqirus and CSL Vifor. Behring, acquired in 2004, manufactures and distributes blood plasma products. Seqirus was formed by a rebranding of BioCSL and the acquired Novartis flu business (bought in 2015) makes flu-related products and performs pandemic-related services for Governments. Finally, Vifor makes products for iron deficiency and nephrology (renal/kidney care). As previously mentioned, CSL’s plasma collection unit creates life-saving treatments for those will serious illnesses globally. CSL relies on plasma and blood collections to perform its primary businesses; and acquisitions are increasingly part of the CSL business. Investors often use CSL as an indirect play on rising spending on healthcare. Since we consider CSL Ltd to be a blue chip stock, or a mature business, we like to look at things like return on invested capital (ROIC) and revenue growth as signs of sustainability. In FY23, CSL Ltd had an ROIC of 10.30% and revenue has compounded at 8.7% in recent years. Anything over 10% ROIC is pretty good for a mature-style business, since its cost of capital is likely below that level, so CSL Ltd crosses this hurdle. RMD share price Resmed was founded in 1989 by Peter Farrell in Australia but is now based in San Diego, California. It is a medical equipment company that provides cloud-connectable continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machines for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). If Resmed’s name or financial reports look different it’s because Resmed’s ASX shares are CDIs and its primary listing is the NYSE. Resmed operates on a global scale, with 10,000+ employees and a presence in over 140 countries. It has two primary business units: Sleep and Respiratory Care, and Software as a Service (SaaS). Within Sleep and Respiratory Care, ResMed provides industry-leading CPAP machines for sleep apnea. Other devices are often marketed in this space but CPAP is the most effective therapy for all severities of OSA. The Respiratory Care unit covers patients ranging from those who only require therapy from CPAP systems at night to those who are dependent on non-invasive or invasive ventilation for life-support. Within the SaaS unit Resmed providers that assists durable or home medical equipment (DME/HME). Basically, it assists in out-of-hospital care. Due to Resmed’s large digital health network powered by its cloud-connected devices, Resmed can leverage its industry-leading hardware (e.g. masks and humidifiers) and its SaaS data to drive insights, improve outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘fast read’ of where the CSL share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, CSL Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 1.29%, which compares to its 5-year average of 1.24%. Put simply, CSL shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield. The RMD share price trades at a price-sales ratio of 4.31x, which compares to its 5-year long-term average of 7.81x. So, RMD shares are trading below their historical average. However, please do more investigating than a simple multiple like this. Our websites explain Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Dividend Discount Models (DDM), and many different ways to value a share, like Resmed CDI. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

{"source_name": "RaskMedia", "title": "Wesfarmers Ltd (ASX: WES) shares: Why WES is an All Star", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/05/07/wesfarmers-asx-wes-share-price/", "publisher_name": "Owen Raszkiewicz", "published_date": "May 7, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu The Wesfarmers ( ASX: WES ) share price stands out as one of the best performers in Australia over recent decades. In the past 15 years, it has compounded at 12% per year, in total return terms (dividends plus growth). Chuck in some franking credits, a deep retail moat, and an industrials business, and it’s easy to see why Wesfarmers is being considered by us as an All Star. Wesfarmers is the owner of retail brands like Bunnings, Kmart, Beaumont Tiles, Target and Officeworks; a chemical and fertilisers business called Wesfarmers CEF; a health business which includes Priceline pharmacies; and Industrials business. Wesfarmers has built a reputation as the quintessential bottom draw stock. Over the past five, ten and 25 years the Perth-based conglomerate has outperformed the broader market. Established in 1914 as the Western Australian farmers cooperative ( hence Wes-farmers ), the business morphed into a holding company with several autonomous divisions. Past activities include agriculture, railroads, supermarkets, coal and insurance – all of which have now been divested. Key Points: Today, the lion’s share of earnings/profits are derived from a portfolio of consumer retailers including Bunnings, Kmart and Officeworks. Wesfarmers also sells chemicals and industrial workwear with more nascent operations in e-commerce, mining and health (Wesfarmers also Catch Group). The Metric that Matters The secret sauce underpinning Wesfarmers success is an unwavering commitment to a “satisfactory return for shareholders”. Indeed, it’s Wesfarmers primary objective and is printed plainly across annual reports and investor communications. The business is industry agnostic, and will go anywhere it can source the best risk-return profile. To deliver great shareholder returns, Wesfarmers seeks investments with high or improving returns on capital (ROC). Wesfarmers have a finite amount of capital to deploy, and therefore seeks opportunities that offer the highest earnings. Low ROC investments eat up capital and in the long run have been shown to deliver poor shareholder returns. The best shareholder returns occur when high returns on capital are paired with a big growth opportunity. There is no better example than Wesfarmers investment in Bunnings. Jewel in the Crown In the 1990s Wesfarmers recognised there was a large but fragmented market for construction supplies. Management acquired a foothold in 1994 via the acquisition of Bunnings, and its attractive timber and forest assets. The aim was to provide low-cost construction materials, rolling out the offering across the country in addition to acquiring and repurposing competitors. However, Bunnings ultimately became a household name by branching out into hardware and the do-it-yourself (DIY) market. Knowledgeable staff attendants, in many cases ex-tradespeople, were employed to broaden the target market from commercial sales to homeowners. The product range evolved from primarily building supplies to include gardening, pet food, paints and lighting. At Bunnings, the humble Saturday sausage sizzle fostered a sense of community and broadened its range of customers. Profits were reinvested into the business to drive economies of scale and lower prices – keeping competitors at bay. Costs were kept low with simple store fit outs, and warehouses were located in industrial areas to reduce land and leasing expenses. Each new store was more profitable than the last, with return on capital increasing from 17% in 2003 to over 65% in 2023. That’s extremely good returns on capital. Competitors were unable to match the low prices, creating an enviable barrier to entry and entrenching Bunnings as the market leader. Today, Bunnings is the strongest hardware and DIY brand in Australia and contributes over $2.2 billion of earnings, equal to 60% of Wesfarmers profits. Expiry date Wesfarmers track record of shareholder returns speaks for itself, but that doesn’t mean the business hasn’t stumbled. The decision to purchase Coles Group ( ASX: COL ) in 2007 diluted returns on capital from above 25%, down to just 7% due to the capital intensity and fierce competition in supermarket retailing. Coles accounted for 64% of the capital employed, but just 35% of the profits. As a result, the share price barely budged over those ten years, serving as yet another lesson for investors that a strong brand doesn’t automatically equate to strong returns. Coles’ internal economics weren’t nearly as good as Bunnings. In 2017, Wesfarmers divested Coles, with returns on capital surging back above 20% and the share price rocketing up 75%. Out of favour, but still good The conglomerate structure (i.e. buying other companies and holding on for many years) broadly is out of favour with investors today. Corners of the market have questioned the attractiveness of conglomerates given the primary feature of instant diversification is now available easily via exchange-traded funds (ETFs). For example, Wesfarmers isn’t an ETF. Yet it’s not quite a managed fund. Nor is it a Listed Investment Company (LIC). And it’s not exactly a retailer. Or a pharmacy. Or construction business. As a result, the divisions that form a conglomerate often trade at a valuation discount when stuck together. If each of those divisions is listed on the ASX separately, in theory, they might trade at a higher price. Finally, while Wesfarmers deserves transparency regarding disclosures, it’s inherently difficult to ascertain the financial health of each division with an aggregate set of financial statements muddying the waters. For example, we don’t know exactly how Officeworks is performing, since some of its financials are bunched in with other businesses. Wesfarmers: next chapter We would argue that given Wesfarmers’ history of shareholder returns, it deserves the benefit of the doubt. The business has instilled a culture of investment discipline, with just seven CEOs and eight Chairman across its 109 years of operations. That’s quite incredible. The conglomerate structure also means it’s able to offset difficulties in one division (e.g. a slowing construction sector) with growth in others (e.g. rising healthcare costs). As a result, earnings are more stable and therefore less susceptible to share price fluctuations than nearly all other blue chip stocks on the ASX. Growth avenues, such as the Mt Holland lithium mine and its budding Health division, should underwrite earnings growth over the medium term. This, in turn, should help the business maintain a premium price-earnings ratio (shown above) in the market, together with a generous dividend payment. In all, we expect Wesfarmers to retain its title as the quintessential bottom-draw stock and continue to reward long term shareholders. Just wait for some bad media attention or a share price sell-off before taking a nibble. Would I buy Wesfarmers shares right now? Given the slow-down in earnings growth and mature nature of the business overall, plus a ‘decent’ 2.8% dividend yield, I don’t believe Wesfarmers is screaming good value today. What’s more, as I discussed recently in this article, Buy CBA shares for income? Here’s a much Better Idea , you can buy a boring ol’ index fund, like the Betashares Australia 200 ETF (ASX: A200) or Vanguard Australian Shares Index Fund ETF ( ASX: VAS ), and get 4% + franking credits. And you’ve got diversification across 200+ companies… it’s a no brainer. What’s more, if you’re studying something like Wesfarmers, it may be worth looking at Washington H. Soul Pattinson & Co. Ltd ( ASX: SOL ), the ASX’s other dominant conglomerate. While it too is a little on the expensive side, it’s a wonderfully impressive business with a fantastic management team.

{"source_name": "RaskMedia", "title": "The Rea Group Ltd (ASX:REA) share price and BHP Group Ltd (ASX:BHP) share price are worth watching", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/05/07/the-rea-group-ltd-asxrea-share-price-and-bhp-group-ltd-asxbhp-share-price-are-worth-watching-10/", "publisher_name": "Rask ASX News Team", "published_date": "May 7, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu REA share price Founded in 1995, REA Group is a Melbourne-based real estate advertising company that is majority owned by News Corp. In Australia, it operates through its Realestate.com.au platform. REA Group operates on a global scale and now operates property websites in around 10 countries used by some 20,000 agents. In a typical month, the core Australian website gets over 55 million visits. The business is broken down across geographic lines, with Australia taking the lion’s share of revenue. Within Australia, REA makes money by listing properties for sale or rent (i.e. the agent uses REA’s website to show properties, which the property owner is on the hook to pay). It also makes money from financial services (e.g. mortgage broking), but this is a much smaller part of the business. Property websites such as Realestate.com.au attract both buyers and sellers and aim to simplify the process resulting in an efficient and stress-free transaction. We believe its competitive advantge is that of any other established platform: network effects and efficient scale. In other words, Domain (the #2 player) is meaningfully behind REA in users and views, which means REA can continue to charge more. While it may be large, Rea Group Ltd is a growth stock, and so it requires a different set of rules and may not be straightforward hard to value, at times. Studies have shown that over 5-10+ years, it’s top-line revenue growth which explains a stock’s performance. That’s why it’s good to see Rea Group Ltd is able to growth revenue at 16.4%, a strong clip. BHP share price BHP Group (formerly BHP Billiton) is a diversified natural resources company producing commodities that was founded in 1885. BHP’s principal business lines are mineral exploration and production. BHP’s assets, operations and interests are separated into three focus areas: Copper and related minerals (e.g. gold, uranium, silver, zinc, etc.), Iron Ore, and Coal (i.e. metallurgical and energy). BHP shares are often seen as a reliable dividend paying investment and is a common constituent of an ASX share portfolio. If you own an popular ETF or LIC, or invest with Industry Super, chances are you have exposure. Share price valuation As a growth company, the way to put a general prediction on the REA share price could be to compare its price-to-sales multiple over time. Currently, Rea Group Ltd shares have a price-sales ratio of 17.06x, which compares to its 5-year average of 12.29x, meaning its shares are trading higher than their historical average. Please keep in mind that context is important – and this is just one valuation technique. I wouldn’t make a decision based on one metric. Since it is a more mature-style business, the BHP share price is offering a historical dividend yield of around 6.11%, which compares to its 5-year average of 9.38%. The Rask websites, especially our Rask Education platform, offer free tutorials explaining Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). Both of these models would be a better way to value the BHP share price. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

It is currently the Australia’s largest company in terms of revenue and market share. Woolworths’ main operations include supermarkets (under the Woolworths brand in Australia and Countdown in New Zealand), retailing through its discount department stores under the Big W brand, and business-to-business (B2B) brands like PFD. Overwhelmingly, it’s 35%+ share of Australian supermarkets is its crown jewel. Woolworths is a very popular choice for many ASX investors seeking dividend income. It consistently pays a fully franked dividend, usually at a yield of over 3%, and offers a very defensive earnings stream. It’s competitive advantage is probably best summarised as scale (distribution, low costs, etc.) and proximity (most shoppers still shop based on distance to the supermarket). Since we consider Woolworths Group Ltd to be a blue chip stock, or a mature business, we like to look at things like return on invested capital (ROIC) and revenue growth as signs of sustainability. In FY23, Woolworths Group Ltd had an ROIC of 13.20% and revenue has compounded at 6.6% in recent years. Anything over 10% ROIC is pretty good for a mature-style business, since its cost of capital is likely below that level, so Woolworths Group Ltd crosses this hurdle. CSL share price CSL is a global biotechnology company that develops and delivers innovative medicines that save lives, protect public health and help people with life-threatening medical conditions live full lives.

Why is Qantas being penalised? Qantas has agreed with the ACCC to pay $20 million of payments to customers and, subject to court approval, a $100 million penalty. The ACCC said the airline admitted it misled consumers by advertising tickets for tens of thousands of flights it had already decided to cancel, and by cancelling thousands more flights without promptly telling ticketholders of its decision. Over 86,000 customers who made a booking on a flight two or more days after the cancellation decision had been made will be compensated as part of the program. Impacted customers will receive $225 for domestic and trans-Tasman flights and $450 for international flights. This is on top of any refund or alternative flight already offered to these customers. Payments will be available through a dedicated online portfolio facilitated by professional services outfit, Deloitte and will be independently audited. Qantas is going to notify impacted customers via email next month about how to lodge a claim. Of the customers affected, 94% were flying domestically on domestic or trans-Tasman routes, with the rest being international. The airline intends to start the remediation program for customers ahead of the Federal Court of Australia approval process. The ACCC is no longer proceeding with its claims against Qantas. Qantas said this expense will be recognised in FY24 and shown outside of underlying profit before tax. The timing of the cash outflow is expected to occur after 30 June 2024, so therefore will happen in FY25. Both statutory and underlying profit can impact the Qantas share price. Management comments The Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson said: When flying resumed after the COVID shutdown, we recognise Qantas let down customers and fell short of our own standards. We know many of our customers were affected by our failure to provide cancellation notifications in a timely manner and we are sincerely sorry. The return to travelling was already stressful for many and we did not deliver enough support for customers and did not have the technology and systems in place to support our people. We have since updated our processes and are investing in new technology across the Qantas Group to ensure this doesn’t happen again. Final thoughts on the Qantas share price Qantas shares seem to be trading on a low price/earnings ratio (p/e ratio), so it could cheap today, particularly if the airline doesn’t see increased competition in the foreseeable future. I’d call it a contrarian opportunity, though not a popular one. With an elevated number of people coming to Australia, the business is well-placed to profit. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio. Imagine earning 4%, 5% — or more — in dividend passive income from the best shares, LICs, or ETFs… it’s like magic. So how do the best investors do it?

ANZ FY24 first-half result The ASX bank share reported a mixed report for the six months to 31 March 2024: Part of the motivation for the $2 billion share buyback was completing the partial sale of its stake in Malaysia’s AmBank, releasing $668 million in capital. Looking at the divisional performance, ‘Australian retail’ cash profit declined 9% to $794 million, ‘Australian commercial’ profit declined 5% to $665 million, ‘institutional’ profit rose 12% to $1.5 billion and ‘New Zealand’ profit increased 2% to NZ$852 million. The Australian retail division saw home loan growth that grew faster than the overall loan systems, with pricing above the cost of capital. In other words, ANZ managed to grow its market share and those new loans were profitable. Customer deposits were up 5%. ANZ’s underlying net interest margin (NIM) showed an ongoing decline. This is the profit measure that shows how much a bank is making on its lending, which includes the cost of paying for funding of the loans (such as savings accounts). The underlying NIM was 2.32% in the FY24 second quarter, 2.33% in FY24 Q1, 2.34% in FY23 Q4, 2.36% in FY23 Q3 and 2.39% in FY23 Q2. Ongoing weakening of the NIM could be bad news for the ANZ share price. Acquisition ANZ continues to make progress on buying the banking operations of Suncorp Group Ltd ( ASX: SUN ) to accelerate its growth and improve its geographic balance. In February 2024, the Australian Competition Tribunal authorised the proposed acquisition . Completion remains subject to approval from the Federal Treasurer and the amendment of the Metway Merger Act. Preparations to integrate Suncorp Bank are “well-advanced”. Outlook for the ANZ share price The ANZ CEO Shayne Elliot said: Both the domestic and international environments are expected to remain challenging across the remainder of the year. The Australian and New Zealand economies are likely to remain subdued, while geopolitical tensions, electoral uncertainty and the introduction of interventionist trade and industry policies will continue internationally. Despite these conditions, we are well positioned with the diversity of our businesses, prudent management, and the strength of our customers holding us in good stead. In fact, our work to build a well-managed, de-risked and diversified bank, coupled with our unique international presence, means we are well placed to succeed in this environment. ANZ seems to be doing quite well in the current environment. Being able to profitably grow market share is an achievement with all of the competition. The higher dividend and large share buyback is pleasing, though falling profit is not exactly a good thing. With arrears continuing to rise with Australian home loans, I’d be wary of how high that’s going to go. With the ANZ share price rallying over the last few months, I don’t think it is an appealing buy today. There are other ASX dividend shares I’d rather choose with more profit growth potential. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

AGL is one of the largest energy retailers and generators of energy in Australia. Upgraded FY24 guidance The energy company updated its guidance for the 2024 financial year ending 30 June 2024. We’ve already seen a solid HY24 result . Underlying EBITDA is now expected to be between $2.12 billion to $2.2 billion, compared to the previous guidance range of $2.025 billion to $2.175 billion. That means it’s expecting underlying EBITDA to between 1.1% to 4.7% more than previously forecast. The underlying net profit after tax (NPAT) is expected to be between $760 million to $810 million, which compared to the previous guidance of between $680 million and $780 million. That means the underlying NPAT guidance was increased between 3.8% to 11.75%. The amount of profit that AGL makes is integral to the AGL share price. AGL explained the update to the guidance reflected the continued “strong operational and financial performance of the business” since the half year result. This increased guidance was due to improved power plant availability, flexibility, and generation, higher consumer demand over the summer period in New South Wales and Queensland, and continued strong performance with its customer markets. AGL noted all guidance is subject to any impacts coming from regulatory and government intervention, variability in trading conditions and plant availability. Is the AGL share price a buy? Investors clearly thought so, with the AGL share price rising so much in response to the update. I don’t know what energy prices are going to do in the coming months and years, but I think energy demand could keep increasing in Australia with a growing population and a rising amount of technology-related usage in the country (such as electric vehicles and data centres). The AGL share price may still underappreciated, despite today’s rise, depending on what happens with energy prices. It’s not exactly a high-growth pick, but I think some investors may be too cautious on the company.

FY24 first-half result Here are some of the highlights from the result for the six months to 31 March 2024: Westpac said it managed growth and margins in a “disciplined way” amid a slowing economic and competitive banking sector. Total loans increased by 1% over the six-month period to $784.8 billion. Total deposits increased by 2% over the six months to $650.9 billion. Over the 12 months loans increased by 5%, with Australian housing loan growth of 5% (at 1.1x the pace of the overall loan system), and Australian business lending growth was 9%. The bank said the impact of competition on mortgage margins moderated during this most recent half. Excluding ‘notable items’, the NIM was unchanged from the second half of 2023 – that’s the profit margin that compares the lending rate to the rate paid to depositors (like savings account). The bigger the NIM, the more it’s making on its lending. While the underlying NIM may have been unchanged over the half, the actual NIM fell 5 basis points (0.05%) over the six months to 1.89%. The direction of the NIM usually has an important influence on the Westpac share price. The consumer segment saw a big decline of profit – down 32% to $1.08 billion – though it only dropped 3% compared to the second half of FY23 as the price competition moderated. Business and wealth net profit rose 7% to $1.14 billion, institutional bank profit fell 3% to $689 million and New Zealand net profit went up 11% to NZ$477 million (due to lower impairment charges). Arrears Westpac said more customers are calling for assistance and it’s helping those that need it. It has “seen an uptick in stress” in its loan books, which “is to be expected given the large increase in interest rates, high inflation and taxation.” Looking at Australian mortgages, the Australian mortgages that are at least 30 days overdue was 1.5% of its loans at September 2023 and 1.8% at March 2024. The loans that were overdue by at least 90 days was 0.9% of total mortgages at September 2023 and 1.1% at March 2024. The bank said while inflation has fallen, “getting it down to target range is proving difficult globally and here in Australia. It is likely interest rates will stay higher for longer.” Final thoughts on the Westpac share price The increased cash returns to shareholders is a bonus and may excite some investors. However, it’s not a good sign that Westpac continues to see arrears rise – at some point this could reach a tipping point. The growing number of loans in arrears for over 90 days is a concern to me. Management seem confident the economy is on track for a soft landing, though this scenario “is not certain”. After a strong rally of Westpac shares in the last six months, I’d be cautious about buying today considering profit is actually going backwards. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

It was founded in 1914 in Victoria, where its HQ still remain. Coles was formerly owned by conglomerate Wesfarmers from 2007 until 2018, when it was spun-off and listed as a separate entity on the ASX under the ticker symbol ‘COL’. Coles’ earnings are dominated by the supermarkets side of the business, however, it partly or fully owns or operates adjacent businesses like flybuys, Liquorland, First Choice, Vintage Cellars, Coles Express and more. Every week millions of Australians choose to shop for essential food and drink at Coles because of its prices, range and location. While it is the smaller brother of Woolworths, which has nearly 40% market share, Coles isn’t too far behind, with about 28%. PLS share price Pilbara Minerals is a leading ASX-listed lithium company, owning 100% of the world’s largest, independent hard-rock lithium operation, Pilgangoora, which it acquired in 2014. Pilbara’s primary business is to, put simply, find, dig up and sell spodumene concentrate. It sells its concentrate through “offtake” agreements and spot sales on the Battery Material Exchange (BMX) platform. A good example of an offtake partner is Great Wall (the Chinese car company) or POSCO, a South Korean company. Pilbara has overcome significant hurdles to become a leader in lithium mining in Australia. However, as a commodities producer, its revenue is still at the mercy of (sometimes dramatic) fluctuations in the price of spodumene in the global market. Even still, bulls would say it’s a ‘pure play’ investment on demand for electric vehicles and battery tech. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘quick read’ of where the COL share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, Coles Group Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 4.09%, which compares to its 5-year average of 3.82%. Put simply, COL shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield. The PLS share price trades at a price-sales ratio of 3.11x, which compares to its 5-year long-term average of 6.53x. So, PLS shares are trading below their historical average. However, please do more investigating than a simple multiple like this.

It is a medical equipment company that provides cloud-connectable continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machines for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). If Resmed’s name or financial reports look different it’s because Resmed’s ASX shares are CDIs and its primary listing is the NYSE. Resmed operates on a global scale, with 10,000+ employees and a presence in over 140 countries. It has two primary business units: Sleep and Respiratory Care, and Software as a Service (SaaS). Within Sleep and Respiratory Care, ResMed provides industry-leading CPAP machines for sleep apnea. Other devices are often marketed in this space but CPAP is the most effective therapy for all severities of OSA. The Respiratory Care unit covers patients ranging from those who only require therapy from CPAP systems at night to those who are dependent on non-invasive or invasive ventilation for life-support. Within the SaaS unit Resmed providers that assists durable or home medical equipment (DME/HME). Basically, it assists in out-of-hospital care. Due to Resmed’s large digital health network powered by its cloud-connected devices, Resmed can leverage its industry-leading hardware (e.g. masks and humidifiers) and its SaaS data to drive insights, improve outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs. While it may be large, Resmed CDI is a growth stock, and so it requires a different set of rules and may not be simple hard to value, at times. Studies have shown that over 5-10+ years, it’s top-line revenue growth which explains a stock’s performance. That’s why it’s good to see Resmed CDI is able to growth revenue at 12.6%, a good clip. WOW share price Founded in 1924, Woolworths is a retail operator in Australia and New Zealand with over 3,000 stores and over 100,000 employees. It is currently the Australia’s largest company in terms of revenue and market share. Woolworths’ main operations include supermarkets (under the Woolworths brand in Australia and Countdown in New Zealand), retailing through its discount department stores under the Big W brand, and business-to-business (B2B) brands like PFD. Overwhelmingly, it’s 35%+ share of Australian supermarkets is its crown jewel. Woolworths is a very popular choice for many ASX investors seeking dividend income. It consistently pays a fully franked dividend, usually at a yield of over 3%, and offers a very defensive earnings stream. It’s competitive advantage is probably best summarised as scale (distribution, low costs, etc.) and proximity (most shoppers still shop based on distance to the supermarket). Share price valuation As a growth company, the way to put a rough forecast on the RMD share price could be to compare its price-to-sales multiple over time. Currently, Resmed CDI shares have a price-sales ratio of 4.45x, which compares to its 5-year average of 7.81x, meaning its shares are trading below their historical average. Please keep in mind that context is important – and this is just one valuation technique. I wouldn’t make a decision based on one metric. Since it is a more mature-style business, the WOW share price is offering a historical dividend yield of around 3.19%, which compares to its 5-year average of 2.66%. The Rask websites, especially our Rask Education platform, offer free tutorials explaining Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). Both of these models would be a better way to value the WOW share price. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

Cettire is a retailer of more than 500,000 luxury items from thousands of brands. Third quarter highlights It reported its sales revenue rose 88% year on year to $191 million – this number includes the effect of allowances and customer refunds. The business said it generated adjusted EBITDA of $6 million on a ‘delivered’ profit margin of more than 20%. In the first nine months of FY24, it generated $32.1 million of adjusted EBITDA on $545 million of sales revenue. The customer metrics all moved in the right direction – the average order value (AOV) grew 12% year on year to $832, the number of active customers rose by 84% to 644,026 and the percentage of gross revenue from repeat customers improved from 59% to 62%. Cettire also revealed it has made “significant progress” regarding entering the mainland China market – it’s going to launch in the fourth quarter of FY24. The company noted since the implementation of its updated checkout in the US on 19 March 2024, it has observed “stable conversion rates”. Cettire said its net cash balance at the end of March 2024 was $90 million. US sales taxes The company noted recent market commentary of its sales tax registration in California and Texas. It said it is “registered for sales taxes in these states and is in good standing”. Cettire also said it has been “collecting and remitting sales taxes as normal in these states”. It also said it is registered for sales taxes in the vast majority of US states which have a sales tax regime. Those states, together with states that don’t have a sales tax, accounted for 99% of its US sales revenue in the third quarter. Cettire is taking steps to register in the other states as and when the obligation arises, such as when it reaches the applicable state-based registration threshold. In the nine months to 31 March 2024, Cettire said it had collected $18.7 million in US sales taxes. Management commentary The Cettire founder and CEO Dean Mintz said: Market conditions remain constructive and we have supplemented our strong customer proposition with marketing investment. Further, our increased focus on traffic quality has driven significant year-on-year improvement in conversion rate and an uplift in average order values. Our business is execution focused. We continue to operate the business to maximise revenue growth, whilst also delivering profitability and cash generation. Whilst Q3 is traditionally a seasonal low point, we observed a strong improvement in year-on-year profit trends. Final thoughts on the Cettire share price The market currently seems to be impressed, with a rise of around 5% of the Cettire share price. Questions have been raised about Cettire’s business model, the taxes and logistics – time will tell if there is something wrong with Cettire, it’s not the sort of bet I’d want to make for my own portfolio. But, the rapid revenue growth is impressive. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio. Imagine earning 4%, 5% — or more — in dividend passive income from the best shares, LICs, or ETFs… it’s like magic. So how do the best investors do it?

It is currently the Australia’s largest company in terms of revenue and market share. Woolworths’ main operations include supermarkets (under the Woolworths brand in Australia and Countdown in New Zealand), retailing through its discount department stores under the Big W brand, and business-to-business (B2B) brands like PFD. Overwhelmingly, it’s 35%+ share of Australian supermarkets is its crown jewel. Woolworths is a very popular choice for many ASX investors seeking dividend income. It consistently pays a fully franked dividend, usually at a yield of over 3%, and offers a very defensive earnings stream. It’s competitive advantage is probably best summarised as scale (distribution, low costs, etc.) and proximity (most shoppers still shop based on distance to the supermarket). CSL share price CSL is a global biotechnology company that develops and delivers innovative medicines that save lives, protect public health and help people with life-threatening medical conditions live full lives. The company is divided into three main business units: CSL Behring, CSL Seqirus and CSL Vifor. Behring, acquired in 2004, manufactures and distributes blood plasma products. Seqirus was formed by a rebranding of BioCSL and the acquired Novartis flu business (bought in 2015) makes flu-related products and performs pandemic-related services for Governments. Finally, Vifor makes products for iron deficiency and nephrology (renal/kidney care). As previously mentioned, CSL’s plasma collection unit creates life-saving treatments for those will serious illnesses globally. CSL relies on plasma and blood collections to perform its primary businesses; and acquisitions are increasingly part of the CSL business. Investors often use CSL as an indirect play on rising spending on healthcare. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘fast read’ of where the WOW share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, Woolworths Group Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 3.23%, which compares to its 5-year average of 2.66%. Put simply, WOW shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield. Since it is a more mature-style business, the CSL share price is offering a historical dividend yield of around 1.29%, which compares to its 5-year average of 1.24%. The Rask websites, especially our Rask Education platform, offer free tutorials explaining Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). Both of these models would be a better way to value the CSL share price. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

Origin is one of Australia’s largest energy generators and retailers. Wind farm acquisition Origin has entered into an agreement with Virya Energy to buy the Yanco Delta wind farm, which was described as one of the largest and most advanced wind and energy storage projects in NSW. Yanco Delta is in the NSW government-designated South West Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) and consists of a 1.5GW wind farm and an 800 MWh battery. The project is located next to key transmission infrastructure. The wind farm is located on a 33,000-hectare site, 10km northwest of Jerilderie in the Riverina district. This wind farm project has received NSW government development approval. It costs $175 million upfront and there’s an additional variable payment of up to $175 million conditional on the project achieving certain development milestones. It’s not significantly material for Origin shares, but future renewable energy generation is an important initiative. The business has a number of projects on the go. It said: Origin’s portfolio of renewable and storage projects includes Walcha Energy’s proposed Ruby Hills Wind Farm and Salisbury Solar Farm projects in the New England REZ, with a planned capacity of more than 1,300 MW. Nearby, Origin has also acquired ‘Warrane’, a 500 MW greenfield development opportunity now known as the Northern Tablelands Wind Farm, while progress continues on large-scale batteries at Eraring and Mortlake power stations. Management commentary Origin CEO Frank Calabria said: Yanco Delta is a large-scale, advanced and therefore highly strategic wind development project. With the key planning and regulatory approvals secured, and with significant plans for supporting infrastructure and transmission in place, the acquisition of Yanco Delta represents a major step forward in our journey to transition Origin’s portfolio to cleaner energy. Origin has made rapid progress in building out a portfolio of renewable and storage projects at varying stages of development, and Yanco Delta represents a unique opportunity to bring a material volume of renewable energy supply into the market relatively quickly, to help meet the needs of our customers. Final thoughts on this deal for Origin shares Australia needs to play its part in decarbonising, and energy generators like Origin can have the biggest impact by changing how the electricity is generated. It’ll be interesting to see if Origin buys more projects to de-risk and accelerate its green plans, or it starts them from scratch.

The majority of the weakness came from the technology and property sectors, which were down 0.5 and 1.8 per cent on the threat of higher bond yields and slower than expected rate cuts. Despite this likely short-term hiccup, GPT Group ( ASX: GPT ) and Scentre Group ( ASX: SCG ) both fell by more than 3 per cent. The highlights once again were the energy and materials sectors, which added 0.6 and 1.2 per cent with the former gaining on reports that Iran may be looking to strike against Israel; Karoon Energy Ltd ( ASX: KAR ) was the standout gaining 4.8 per cent. Shares in super platform Netwealth Group Ltd ( ASX: NWL ) were 5 per cent lower despite the company reporting another $2.7 billion in platform inflows taking assets under administration to $84.7 billion. Burns group Avita sinks on downgrade Shares in burns treatment group AVITA Medical Inc ( ASX: AVH ) fell by more than 11 per cent after the company indicated that sales for the March quarter were well below guidance, set to finish at between US$11 and $13 million. The weakness was due to slow uptake of its latest product rollout. Nextdc Ltd ( ASX: NXT ) remains in a trading halt as Next DC seeks to raise a further $1.3 billion in order to fund an expansion of its Sydney and Melbourne data centres amid an AI and computing power arms race. Next DC is clearly seeking to solidify its position as the market leader in Australia. Gold miner Northern Star Resources Ltd ( ASX: NST ) jumped 2.4 per cent as a blow out in the cost of production to $1,810 to $1,860 per ounce was less than expected by the market. Markets rally as Amazon joins record high party The Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) underperformed once again, falling 0.1 per cent, as the broader market was supported by a renewed rally in technology companies. The Nasdaq Composite (INDEXNASDAQ: .IXIC) finished at a record, gaining 1.7 per cent and the S&P 500 (INDEXSP: .INX) finished 0.7 per cent higher as both Amazon.com Inc ( NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Alphabet Inc Class A ( NASDAQ: GOOGL ) gained strongly. Amazon is the latest tech giant to reach a record high, hitting a market value of US$2 trillion as management highlighted hopes the company would be able to ‘democratize’ parts of the AI ecosystem. Earnings season is set to commence with the banking sector on Friday, in which all eyes will be on net interest margins, experts are predicting profit growth of just 3.8 per cent from the market, but 38 per cent from the Magnificent Seven. The latest producer price data showed slowing in price growth in key areas, while the ECB has all but confirmed rate cuts will begin sooner rather than later as they seek to stimulate the struggling economy.

{"source_name": "RaskMedia", "title": "The Wesfarmers Ltd (ASX:WES) share price and Rea Group Ltd (ASX:REA) share price are worth watching", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/04/13/the-wesfarmers-ltd-asxwes-share-price-and-rea-group-ltd-asxrea-share-price-are-worth-watching-8/", "publisher_name": "Rask ASX News Team", "published_date": "April 13, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu WES share price Founded in 1914, Wesfarmers is an Australian conglomerate headquartered in Perth. It mainly has operations across Australia and New Zealand, operating in retail, chemical, fertiliser, industrial and safety products. It’s easy to think of Wesfarmers like a publicly listed private equity company. It has a long history of buying businesses, benefitting from their cash flows, re-investing in them and then selling them for a more attractive price. A good example of this might be Coles Group, which is bought in 2007 and spun out in 2018. However, by far (over 50%) of the company’s operating profit comes from Bunnings, the #1 hardware and home improvement business in Australia. It bought the remaining 52% of Bunnings that it didn’t own in 1994 for $594 million. Other brands include Kmart, Target, Officeworks, Blackwoods and Priceline Pharmacy. Wesfarmers has long been considered a leading blue chip stock for the average ASX share portfolio. Wesfarmers has quality assets such as Bunnings, Kmart and Officeworks and pays a consistent dividend to its shareholders. Since we consider Wesfarmers Ltd to be a blue chip stock, or a mature business, we like to look at things like return on invested capital (ROIC) and revenue growth as signs of sustainability. In FY23, Wesfarmers Ltd had an ROIC of 19.00% and revenue has compounded at 12.2% in recent years. Anything over 10% ROIC is pretty strong for a mature-style business, since its cost of capital is likely below that level, so Wesfarmers Ltd crosses this hurdle. REA share price Founded in 1995, REA Group is a Melbourne-based real estate advertising company that is majority owned by News Corp. In Australia, it operates through its Realestate.com.au platform. REA Group operates on a global scale and now operates property websites in around 10 countries used by some 20,000 agents. In a typical month, the core Australian website gets over 55 million visits. The business is broken down across geographic lines, with Australia taking the lion’s share of revenue. Within Australia, REA makes money by listing properties for sale or rent (i.e. the agent uses REA’s website to show properties, which the property owner is on the hook to pay). It also makes money from financial services (e.g. mortgage broking), but this is a much smaller part of the business. Property websites such as Realestate.com.au attract both buyers and sellers and aim to simplify the process resulting in an efficient and stress-free transaction. We believe its competitive advantge is that of any other established platform: network effects and efficient scale. In other words, Domain (the #2 player) is meaningfully behind REA in users and views, which means REA can continue to charge more. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘speedy read’ of where the WES share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, Wesfarmers Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 2.86%, which compares to its 5-year average of 3.84%. Put simply, WES shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield. The REA share price trades at a price-sales ratio of 16.99x, which compares to its 5-year long-term average of 12.29x. So, its shares are trading higher than their historical average. However, please do more investigating than a simple multiple like this. Our websites explain Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Dividend Discount Models (DDM), and many different ways to value a share, like Rea Group Ltd. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

BHP’s principal business lines are mineral exploration and production. BHP’s assets, operations and interests are separated into three focus areas: Copper and related minerals (e.g. gold, uranium, silver, zinc, etc.), Iron Ore, and Coal (i.e. metallurgical and energy). BHP shares are often seen as a reliable dividend paying investment and is a common constituent of an ASX share portfolio. If you own an popular ETF or LIC, or invest with Industry Super, chances are you have exposure. WES share price Founded in 1914, Wesfarmers is an Australian conglomerate headquartered in Perth. It mainly has operations across Australia and New Zealand, operating in retail, chemical, fertiliser, industrial and safety products. It’s easy to think of Wesfarmers like a publicly listed private equity company. It has a long history of buying businesses, benefitting from their cash flows, re-investing in them and then selling them for a more attractive price. A good example of this might be Coles Group, which is bought in 2007 and spun out in 2018. However, by far (over 50%) of the company’s operating profit comes from Bunnings, the #1 hardware and home improvement business in Australia. It bought the remaining 52% of Bunnings that it didn’t own in 1994 for $594 million. Other brands include Kmart, Target, Officeworks, Blackwoods and Priceline Pharmacy. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘quick read’ of where the BHP share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, BHP Group Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 5.70%, which compares to its 5-year average of 9.38%. Put simply, BHP shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield. Since it is a more mature-style business, the WES share price is offering a historical dividend yield of around 2.85%, which compares to its 5-year average of 3.84%. The Rask websites, especially our Rask Education platform, offer free tutorials explaining Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). Both of these models would be a better way to value the WES share price. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio. Imagine earning 4%, 5% — or more — in dividend passive income from the best shares, LICs, or ETFs… it’s like magic. So how do the best investors do it?

FY24 third quarter update The mining business reported its quarterly numbers for the three months to 31 March 2024. It produced 465.9kt of copper, which was a 7% rise quarter on quarter and a 15% rise year on year. This increase was largely thanks to a solid performance by Escondida. BHP produced 61.5mt of iron ore, which was down 7% quarter on quarter and up 3% year on year. The company was pleased with its iron production amid heavy rainfall. This is the key segment for supporting the BHP share price. The miner reported it produced 6mt of metallurgical coal, which was up 6% quarter on quarter and down 13% year on year. Energy coal production was 4.1mt, representing an increase of 8% quarter on quarter and 5% year on year. The nickel production was 18.8kt, down a disappointing 4% quarter on quarter and down 4% year on year. BHP noted it had divested the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) metallurgical coal mines Blackwater and Daunia mines to Whitehaven Coal Ltd ( ASX: WHC ) for a total cash amount of up to US$4.1 billion (on a 100% basis). BMA now has a “more focused operational footprint and a greater portion of higher quality metallurgical coal, which is expected to achieve higher relative margins in a decarbonising world.” Final thoughts on the BHP share price BHP is the lowest-cost iron ore producer globally. It’s investing in improvements to its rail and port operations, which are “essential for growth” in the medium-term to 305 million tonnes per annum and beyond. The company said it remains on track to meet copper, iron ore and energy coal production for the year. BHP is a high-performing miner and it has been a good investment for dividends for most of the past decade. The outlook for copper seems promising with the world focused on decarbonising. The more that BHP diversifies away from relying on iron, the better, in my view. I wouldn’t call it a great buy at the current price, but I think there could be an opportunistic time to buy in a decline in the next couple of years. I don’t know when it’ll happen, but the iron ore miners do seem to regularly go through significant volatility. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

March 2024 quarter highlights Pilbara Minerals reported that its production of spodumene concentrate (raw lithium) increased by 2% quarter on quarter to 179kt, while sales rose by 3% to 165.1kt. However, the realised price that Pilbara Minerals sold its commodity for was US$804 per dry metric tonne (dmt), which was down another 28% quarter on quarter. This huge decrease in the lithium price led to revenue falling 27% quarter on quarter to $192 million. Pilbara Minerals’ unit operating cost (FOB Port Hedland), including the mining, processing, transport, port charges and site-based general and administration costs and is net of any tantalite by-product credits, increased 6% quarter on quarter to A$675 per dmt. Temporary mobile ore sorting equipment was deployed, increasing costs, but helped “supplemental ore and to bring forward optimisation learnings” as the company ramps up production. However, the unit operating cost (CIF China) includes FOB Port Hedland, plus freight and royalty costs, declined 2% quarter to quarter to A$789 million. Pilbara Minerals’ cash balance decreased by 2% to A$789 per tonne. Promising signs for the Pilbara Minerals share price The company said that during the quarter, the lithium price stabilised and then increased toward the end of the March quarter. The pre-auction sale of 5k dmt at US$1,106 per dmt in March, reflecting the “ongoing demand and positive pricing for unallocated production volume.” March set a new monthly production record with over 80k dmt produced at a unit operating cost (FOB) of less than $625 per dmt thanks to expanded production capacity with no shutdowns, higher ore lithium head grade and higher lithium recoveries due to operational improvements. The business continues to work on its P680 and P1000 expansion projects, which are on schedule and on budget. It’s also exploring the potential to explore expanding the Pilgangoora operation capacity beyond 1mt per year. The pre-feasibility study is on schedule to be released in the June quarter. The ASX lithium share is doing all the right things, but it doesn’t have control of the lithium price, which might be the most important factor for success in the medium-term. I wouldn’t call the Pilbara Minerals share price a buy until it’s clearer that the lithium supply-demand relationship is favourable for the company.

{"source_name": "RaskMedia", "title": "Why invest in ASX tech stocks?", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/04/17/why-invest-in-asx-tech-stocks-patrick-poke-betashares/", "publisher_name": "Patrick Poke", "published_date": "April 17, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu The strong performance of the Nasdaq-100 (INDEXNASDAQ: NDX) Index underlines an important lesson. Technology companies can produce big winners. In fact, the tech sector has produced some of the biggest wealth-creating stocks of the past century. In 2023, Arizona State University business professor Hendrik Bessembinder updated his famous 2017 study, which found only a handful of stocks explained much of the wealth created by the US stock market. His expanded study covered the performance of US stocks between 1926 and 2022. He found that just 72 stocks accounted for half of the net wealth creation since 1926. Of the top five firms with the largest shareholder wealth creation, four were tech stocks. The highest representation by sector. All are household names: Australia’s low exposure to tech stocks Thus, not having exposure to technology stocks might be suboptimal for your portfolio. This can be a problem for Australian investors, given the low presence of tech stocks in the S&P/ASX 200 ( INDEXASX: XJO ). Australia is known for its big banks and big miners, which are reflected in the stock market. Financials and materials companies make up over 50% of the S&P/ASX 200. Information technology only 2.9%. For comparison, the same two sectors make up only 15.6% of the US S&P 500 (INDEXSP: .INX) index, while information technology comprises 29.6%. Thankfully, there are ETFs available on the ASX today for Australian investors seeking exposure to local tech stocks. The S&P/ASX All Technology Index tracks Australia’s leading tech businesses. And Betashares S&P/ASX Australian Technology ETF (ASX: ATEC) is the only ETF traded on Australian exchanges offering exposure to this index. Let’s canvas reasons why you should consider ATEC . Australia’s underrated tech sector Australia, despite its association with resources, is home to multiple dominant tech firms. But the local tech sector has flown under the radar. That may be a boon. The success of the ‘Magnificent Seven’ over the past year has attracted plenty of attention and stoked high expectations. But with these few companies already accounting for large portions of many investors’ portfolios, it may make sense to diversify technology exposures by looking closer to home. ASX tech sector’s outperformance The S&P/ASX 200 Index set a record high earlier this year. Yet it has still underperformed the local tech sector over the last decade. ATEC outperformed the broader S&P/ASX 200 over the year to March 2024, gaining 40.77%, while the S&P/ASX 200 gained 14.4%. Over the five-year period to March 2024, ATEC’s index returned 13.2% p.a., beating the S&P/ASX 200’s gain of 9.2% p.a.. Tech sector’s strong year Why the strong outperformance? Some of this can be attributed to the excitement around the tech sector emanating from the US. Big rallies in the US tend to reverberate locally, too. Other factors include global excitement about artificial intelligence (AI) and the expectation of falling interest rates. The US is not the only market featuring AI stocks. Both WiseTech Global Ltd ( ASX: WTC ) and Nextdc Ltd ( ASX: NXT ) — large components of ATEC — gained in 2023 as investors boosted revenue growth expectations driven by AI. WiseTech was up 35% over the past year. NEXTDC was up 40%. In February, logistics software firm WiseTech reported a 32% increase in revenue and an 8% increase in profits for the first half of FY24. In an earnings call following the results, WiseTech’s CEO and founder Richard White said WiseTech is “putting enormous amounts of investment into forward product development using AI, machine learning, big data, [and] automation.” And at its latest annual general meeting in November, data centre infrastructure provider NEXTDC also talked up the growth potential of servicing AI demand: At present, artificial intelligence is stimulating unprecedented demand for data centre services globally. It’s encouraging to note we’re yet to experience AI’s full impact on demand at NEXTDC. The wave of artificial intelligence infrastructure deployment is just arriving in Australia. Expectations of falling interest rates are helping the sector too as tech stock valuations are highly sensitive to interest rates. Other factors are home grown. Australian tech companies like Carsales, Rea Group Ltd ( ASX: REA ), Xero Ltd ( ASX: XRO ), and Seek Ltd ( ASX: SEK ) hold dominant market positions in their segments. Their competitive advantages lead to strong operating margins and pricing power. There is local innovation, too. Take medical imaging software firm Pro Medicus Limited ( ASX: PME ), one of the largest components of ATEC . Pro Medicus has been a quiet success story, gaining over 8,000% since listing in 2000. It has continued to grow sales each year, cementing a leading position in its industry. FY25 analyst estimates have the firm boasting a Return on Equity of 48.8%. Tech stocks may grow further In the long run, stock prices tend to follow earnings. And many of Australia’s leading tech stocks — like Pro Medicus — are highly profitable. This bodes well for the long-term potential of many of these businesses and the sector as a whole. For instance, constituents of ATEC’s index are expected to outpace the sales and earnings of S&P/ASX 200 constituents. As of 10 April 2024, consensus estimates have ATEC sales growing 17.4% in CY24, 9% in CY25 and 9.3% in CY26. Yet S&P/ASX 200 sales are expected to rise only 4.5% in CY24, 2.8% in CY25 and 3.8% in CY26. Summing up With the nascent adoption of AI, cloud computing, big data, automation, and the Internet of Things, there’s a good chance that the next decade’s major winners will come from the tech sector. Despite Australia’s sharemarket skewing heavily towards financials and resources, investors can gain direct exposure to Aussie tech stocks via ATEC. Gain exposure to leading ASX technology stocks All investing involves risk. Tech stocks, especially, are not immune from volatility. But you don’t have to pick individual winners. In one trade, investors can gain exposure to a basket of leading Aussie tech companies. Investing in the tech sector as a whole mitigates stock-specific risks through diversification. Why seek the needle when you can buy the haystack?

In Australia, it operates through its Realestate.com.au platform. REA Group operates on a global scale and now operates property websites in around 10 countries used by some 20,000 agents. In a typical month, the core Australian website gets over 55 million visits. The business is broken down across geographic lines, with Australia taking the lion’s share of revenue. Within Australia, REA makes money by listing properties for sale or rent (i.e. the agent uses REA’s website to show properties, which the property owner is on the hook to pay). It also makes money from financial services (e.g. mortgage broking), but this is a much smaller part of the business. Property websites such as Realestate.com.au attract both buyers and sellers and aim to simplify the process resulting in an efficient and stress-free transaction. We believe its competitive advantge is that of any other established platform: network effects and efficient scale. In other words, Domain (the #2 player) is meaningfully behind REA in users and views, which means REA can continue to charge more. While it may be large, Rea Group Ltd is a growth stock, and so it requires a different set of rules and may not be straightforward hard to value, at times. Studies have shown that over 5-10+ years, it’s top-line revenue growth which explains a stock’s performance. That’s why it’s good to see Rea Group Ltd is able to growth revenue at 16.4%, a strong clip. BHP share price BHP Group (formerly BHP Billiton) is a diversified natural resources company producing commodities that was founded in 1885. BHP’s principal business lines are mineral exploration and production. BHP’s assets, operations and interests are separated into three focus areas: Copper and related minerals (e.g. gold, uranium, silver, zinc, etc.), Iron Ore, and Coal (i.e. metallurgical and energy). BHP shares are often seen as a reliable dividend paying investment and is a common constituent of an ASX share portfolio. If you own an popular ETF or LIC, or invest with Industry Super, chances are you have exposure. Share price valuation As a growth company, the way to put a general prediction on the REA share price could be to compare its price-to-sales multiple over time. Currently, Rea Group Ltd shares have a price-sales ratio of 16.75x, which compares to its 5-year average of 12.29x, meaning its shares are trading higher than their historical average. Please keep in mind that context is important – and this is just one valuation technique. I wouldn’t make a decision based on one metric. Since it is a more mature-style business, the BHP share price is offering a historical dividend yield of around 5.79%, which compares to its 5-year average of 9.38%. The Rask websites, especially our Rask Education platform, offer free tutorials explaining Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). Both of these models would be a better way to value the BHP share price. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio. Imagine earning 4%, 5% — or more — in dividend passive income from the best shares, LICs, or ETFs… it’s like magic. So how do the best investors do it?

It is currently the Australia’s largest company in terms of revenue and market share. Woolworths’ main operations include supermarkets (under the Woolworths brand in Australia and Countdown in New Zealand), retailing through its discount department stores under the Big W brand, and business-to-business (B2B) brands like PFD. Overwhelmingly, it’s 35%+ share of Australian supermarkets is its crown jewel. Woolworths is a very popular choice for many ASX investors seeking dividend income. It consistently pays a fully franked dividend, usually at a yield of over 3%, and offers a very defensive earnings stream. It’s competitive advantage is probably best summarised as scale (distribution, low costs, etc.) and proximity (most shoppers still shop based on distance to the supermarket). Since we consider Woolworths Group Ltd to be a blue chip stock, or a mature business, we like to look at things like return on invested capital (ROIC) and revenue growth as signs of sustainability. In FY23, Woolworths Group Ltd had an ROIC of 13.20% and revenue has compounded at 6.6% in recent years. Anything over 10% ROIC is pretty good for a mature-style business, since its cost of capital is likely below that level, so Woolworths Group Ltd crosses this hurdle. CSL share price CSL is a global biotechnology company that develops and delivers innovative medicines that save lives, protect public health and help people with life-threatening medical conditions live full lives. The company is divided into three main business units: CSL Behring, CSL Seqirus and CSL Vifor. Behring, acquired in 2004, manufactures and distributes blood plasma products. Seqirus was formed by a rebranding of BioCSL and the acquired Novartis flu business (bought in 2015) makes flu-related products and performs pandemic-related services for Governments. Finally, Vifor makes products for iron deficiency and nephrology (renal/kidney care). As previously mentioned, CSL’s plasma collection unit creates life-saving treatments for those will serious illnesses globally. CSL relies on plasma and blood collections to perform its primary businesses; and acquisitions are increasingly part of the CSL business. Investors often use CSL as an indirect play on rising spending on healthcare. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘fast read’ of where the WOW share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, Woolworths Group Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 3.27%, which compares to its 5-year average of 2.66%. Put simply, WOW shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield. Since it is a more mature-style business, the CSL share price is offering a historical dividend yield of around 1.33%, which compares to its 5-year average of 1.24%. The Rask websites, especially our Rask Education platform, offer free tutorials explaining Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). Both of these models would be a better way to value the CSL share price. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

Woodside is one of the largest oil and gas companies in the Asia Pacific region. March 2024 quarter For the three months to March 2024, it achieved quarterly production of 44.9 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe), which was down 7% from the fourth quarter of 2023 due to lower production at Bass Strait, Pyrenees and Pluto partially offset by increased production at Mag Dog phase 2. Its average realised price for the quarter was $63 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE), which was a reduction of 5% quarter on quarter, or a 25% fall year on year. Project progress Woodside is working on a number of projects, and the ASX energy share provided some updates. These projects will play a large part in the success of the Woodside share price in the future. The Scarborough energy project commenced drilling of production wells and the first Pluto train 2 modules were delivered to the site. The project was 62% complete at the end of the quarter and it’s targeting the first LNG cargo in 2026. The floating production storage and offloading for the Sangomar project arrived offshore Senegal. Commissioning activities have started. Sangomar was 96% complete at the end of the quarter and it’s targeting first oil in mid-2024. Woodside’s Trion project continued to progress engineering, procurement and contracting activities including the award of the subsea marine installation contract. There has been continued offtake discussions for the (hydrogen) H2OK project and progressed commercial agreements for the Woodside solar project. Management comments The Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill said: During the period we completed the sale of a 10% non-operated interest in the Scarborough project to LNG Japan and entered into an agreement with JERA for the sale of a further 15.1% of the Scarborough joint venture. We are very pleased to have participants of the calibre of LNG Japan and JERA in Scarborough. Their support for the project demonstrates the quality of the asset and the importance of gas to Japan’s energy mix. We continue to deliver on our strategy to thrive through the energy transition and we published our Climate Transition Action Plan and 2023 Progress Report in February. As Australia’s largest energy company, feedback arising from our engagement with investors and stakeholders reflects the challenges and complexities of navigating the energy transition. Final thoughts on the Woodside share price The ASX energy share is back to a share price we’ve not seen since the first half of 2022. I wouldn’t call Woodside a cheap buy yet, but I think it’s looking more interesting on a cyclical viewpoint considering there’s a fair chance energy prices could rise amid the volatility in the Middle East. The environmental side of things may not appeal to some investors, and I’d suggest there are a fair few other ASX dividend shares that could be better ideas for long-term growth. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

Pilbara’s primary business is to, put simply, find, dig up and sell spodumene concentrate. It sells its concentrate through “offtake” agreements and spot sales on the Battery Material Exchange (BMX) platform. A good example of an offtake partner is Great Wall (the Chinese car company) or POSCO, a South Korean company. Pilbara has overcome significant hurdles to become a leader in lithium mining in Australia. However, as a commodities producer, its revenue is still at the mercy of (sometimes dramatic) fluctuations in the price of spodumene in the global market. Even still, bulls would say it’s a ‘pure play’ investment on demand for electric vehicles and battery tech. SOL share price Founded in 1903, Washington H. Soul Pattinson (WHSP) is an investment company with a diversified portfolio of assets across a range of industries and asset classes. Some of SOL’s largest holdings include stakes in other well-known publicly listed companies such as TPG Telecom ( ASX: TPG ), New Hope Group ( ASX: NHC ) and a cross shareholding in Brickworks ( ASX: BKW ). SOL’s mission is to deliver superior returns to its shareholders by creating capital growth and steadily increasing dividends as a holding company. It’s the second-oldest publicly listed company on the ASX and has a strong track record of capital growth and dividends. It should be thought of as family-run LIC, for the benefit of all shareholders (who are deeply aligned).

It is a medical equipment company that provides cloud-connectable continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machines for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). If Resmed’s name or financial reports look different it’s because Resmed’s ASX shares are CDIs and its primary listing is the NYSE. Resmed operates on a global scale, with 10,000+ employees and a presence in over 140 countries. It has two primary business units: Sleep and Respiratory Care, and Software as a Service (SaaS). Within Sleep and Respiratory Care, ResMed provides industry-leading CPAP machines for sleep apnea.

The Respiratory Care unit covers patients ranging from those who only require therapy from CPAP systems at night to those who are dependent on non-invasive or invasive ventilation for life-support. Within the SaaS unit Resmed providers that assists durable or home medical equipment (DME/HME). Basically, it assists in out-of-hospital care.

{"source_name": "RaskMedia", "title": "2 exciting ASX shares I’d buy in May 2024", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/04/30/2-exciting-asx-shares-id-buy-in-may-2024/", "publisher_name": "Jaz Harrison", "published_date": "April 30, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu The two ASX share ideas in this article look like they have lots of growth potential, in my opinion. We all know about the large growth companies that have grown significantly such as Microsoft , Alphabet , Xero Ltd ( ASX: XRO ) and REA Group Ltd ( ASX: REA ). But, they come with a high price. I’m going to talk about two ASX share options that could achieve strong capital growth in the years ahead. Airtasker Ltd (ASX: ART) Airtasker says it’s Australia’s leading online marketplace for local services , connecting people and businesses who need work done with people who want to work. I think there’s a growing trend of people willing to buy products and services online, which is a useful tailwind of digital adoption. The longer Airtasker is around, the more legitimate the marketplace platform will be for potential customers. With a digital model, the business is able to earn very high gross profit margins of well over 90%. Additional revenue is very beneficial for generating more profit, even though it’s investing for growth in Australia, the UK and the US. The FY24 third quarter saw marketplace revenue grow by 11.5% to $10.1 million, following 49.1% growth of UK posted tasks amid its partnership with Channel 4 in the UK. For that quarter, it made positive total EBITDA of $0.6 million, an improvement of $1.5 million year on year. It also generated positive free cashflow, while operating cashflow increased $4.3 million to $3.1 million. The UK spring and summer period should be the company’s “biggest quarter”. From here, I think Airtasker can either see rapid improvement in cashflow, or significantly lift its spending on growth initiates, which could be a big boost for the ASX share over the long-term. VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat AUD ETF (ASX: MOAT) This exchange-traded fund (ETF) invests in US businesses that are expected to have durable competitive advantages for the next decade or two. Competitive advantages can come in many different forms including patents, brand power, cost advantages, network effects and so on. The MOAT ETF has a management fee of 0nly 0.49% per year, which I think is very cheap considering what it does and how well it has performed. From a list of high-quality businesses, the MOAT ETF only invests in businesses that are at a good value compared to what the Morningstar analysts think the stock is actually worth. Over the past three years, the VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat AUD ETF has returned an average of 15.9% per year. I don’t know what future returns will be, but I think it can outperform the ASX. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio. Imagine earning 4%, 5% — or more — in dividend passive income from the best shares, LICs, or ETFs… it’s like magic. So how do the best investors do it? Chief Investment Officer Owen Rask has just released his brand new passive income report . Owen has outlined 10 of his favourite ETFs and shares to watch, his rules for passive income investing, why he would buy ETFs before LICs and more.

{"source_name": "RaskMedia", "title": "The Wesfarmers Ltd (ASX:WES) share price and Rea Group Ltd (ASX:REA) share price are worth watching", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/05/01/the-wesfarmers-ltd-asxwes-share-price-and-rea-group-ltd-asxrea-share-price-are-worth-watching-10/", "publisher_name": "Rask ASX News Team", "published_date": "May 1, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu WES share price Founded in 1914, Wesfarmers is an Australian conglomerate headquartered in Perth. It mainly has operations across Australia and New Zealand, operating in retail, chemical, fertiliser, industrial and safety products. It’s easy to think of Wesfarmers like a publicly listed private equity company. It has a long history of buying businesses, benefitting from their cash flows, re-investing in them and then selling them for a more attractive price. A good example of this might be Coles Group, which is bought in 2007 and spun out in 2018. However, by far (over 50%) of the company’s operating profit comes from Bunnings, the #1 hardware and home improvement business in Australia. It bought the remaining 52% of Bunnings that it didn’t own in 1994 for $594 million. Other brands include Kmart, Target, Officeworks, Blackwoods and Priceline Pharmacy. Wesfarmers has long been considered a leading blue chip stock for the average ASX share portfolio. Wesfarmers has quality assets such as Bunnings, Kmart and Officeworks and pays a consistent dividend to its shareholders. Since we consider Wesfarmers Ltd to be a blue chip stock, or a mature business, we like to look at things like return on invested capital (ROIC) and revenue growth as signs of sustainability. In FY23, Wesfarmers Ltd had an ROIC of 19.00% and revenue has compounded at 12.2% in recent years. Anything over 10% ROIC is pretty strong for a mature-style business, since its cost of capital is likely below that level, so Wesfarmers Ltd crosses this hurdle. REA share price Founded in 1995, REA Group is a Melbourne-based real estate advertising company that is majority owned by News Corp. In Australia, it operates through its Realestate.com.au platform. REA Group operates on a global scale and now operates property websites in around 10 countries used by some 20,000 agents. In a typical month, the core Australian website gets over 55 million visits. The business is broken down across geographic lines, with Australia taking the lion’s share of revenue. Within Australia, REA makes money by listing properties for sale or rent (i.e. the agent uses REA’s website to show properties, which the property owner is on the hook to pay). It also makes money from financial services (e.g. mortgage broking), but this is a much smaller part of the business. Property websites such as Realestate.com.au attract both buyers and sellers and aim to simplify the process resulting in an efficient and stress-free transaction. We believe its competitive advantge is that of any other established platform: network effects and efficient scale. In other words, Domain (the #2 player) is meaningfully behind REA in users and views, which means REA can continue to charge more. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘speedy read’ of where the WES share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, Wesfarmers Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 2.86%, which compares to its 5-year average of 3.84%. Put simply, WES shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield. The REA share price trades at a price-sales ratio of 17.05x, which compares to its 5-year long-term average of 12.29x. So, its shares are trading higher than their historical average. However, please do more investigating than a simple multiple like this. Our websites explain Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Dividend Discount Models (DDM), and many different ways to value a share, like Rea Group Ltd. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio. Imagine earning 4%, 5% — or more — in dividend passive income from the best shares, LICs, or ETFs… it’s like magic. So how do the best investors do it?

{"source_name": "RaskMedia", "title": "Looking for an ASX growth share? Try the Pilbara Minerals Ltd (ASX:PLS) share price", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/04/29/looking-for-an-asx-growth-share-try-the-pilbara-minerals-ltd-asxpls-share-price-10/", "publisher_name": "Rask ASX News Team", "published_date": "April 29, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu PLS share price Pilbara Minerals is a leading ASX-listed lithium company, owning 100% of the world’s largest, independent hard-rock lithium operation, Pilgangoora, which it acquired in 2014. Pilbara’s primary business is to, put simply, find, dig up and sell spodumene concentrate. It sells its concentrate through “offtake” agreements and spot sales on the Battery Material Exchange (BMX) platform. A good example of an offtake partner is Great Wall (the Chinese car company) or POSCO, a South Korean company. Pilbara has overcome significant hurdles to become a leader in lithium mining in Australia. However, as a commodities producer, its revenue is still at the mercy of (sometimes dramatic) fluctuations in the price of spodumene in the global market. Even still, bulls would say it’s a ‘pure play’ investment on demand for electric vehicles and battery tech. SOL share price Founded in 1903, Washington H. Soul Pattinson (WHSP) is an investment company with a diversified portfolio of assets across a range of industries and asset classes. Some of SOL’s largest holdings include stakes in other well-known publicly listed companies such as TPG Telecom ( ASX: TPG ), New Hope Group ( ASX: NHC ) and a cross shareholding in Brickworks ( ASX: BKW ). SOL’s mission is to deliver superior returns to its shareholders by creating capital growth and steadily increasing dividends as a holding company. It’s the second-oldest publicly listed company on the ASX and has a strong track record of capital growth and dividends. It should be thought of as family-run LIC, for the benefit of all shareholders (who are deeply aligned). Share price valuation As a growth company, the way to put a rough calculation on the PLS share price could be to compare its price-to-sales multiple over time. Currently, Pilbara Minerals Ltd shares have a price-sales ratio of 2.81x, which compares to its 5-year average of 6.53x, meaning its shares are trading below their historical average. Please keep in mind that context is important – and this is just one valuation technique. I wouldn’t make a decision based on one metric. Since it is a more mature-style business, the SOL share price is offering a historical dividend yield of around 2.90%, which compares to its 5-year average of 2.54%. The Rask websites, especially our Rask Education platform, offer free tutorials explaining Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). Both of these models would be a better way to value the SOL share price. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

Megaport is a tech company that enables businesses around the world to connect with cloud infrastructure. It says its global software defined network (SDN) helps businesses rapidly connect their network to services via an easy-to-use portal or its open API (application programming interface). The company says its agile networking capabilities reduce operating costs and increase speed to market compared to traditional networking solutions. It partners with cloud service operators like AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and the largest data centre operators, system integrators and managed service providers in the world. Upgraded EBITDA guidance Megaport has announced that thanks to continued improvement in the company’s operating and financial performance , the ASX tech share has upgraded its FY24 EBITDA guidance to be in the range of $56 million to $58 million, an increase on the previous FY24 guidance of between $51 million to $57 million. Usually, increased profit would be a positive for the Megaport share price, but perhaps investors were expecting even more. If the business achieves that guidance, it would reflect an increase of EBITDA of between 177% to 187% compared to FY23’s normalised EBITDA of $20.2 million. Megaport confirms it expects FY24 revenue to be in the range of $190 million to $195 million, which would represent an increase of between 24% to 27% compared to FY23’s revenue of $153.1 million. The company also confirmed FY24 capital expenditure guidance of between $20 million to $22 million. This guidance is taking into account the planned investment in go-to-market capabilities, product development, marketing, advertising, travel, entertainment, professional fees and planned capital expenditure, and excludes any future strategic initiatives the company may decide to undertake. Final thoughts on the Megaport share price The Megaport share price is up almost 50% this year and it’s up more than 140% over the past 12 months. It’s a bit cheaper today, but it’s priced for success. The business continues to grow revenue at a decent pace, though growth is somewhat slowing. As long as profitability grows at a good pace, it may be able to beat the market over the long-term from here. But, I’m not sure how big the business can become, so I’d rather wait for a better Megaport share price.

The supermarket business used to own all of Endeavour Group, which is the business that operates liquor businesses (such as Dan Murphy’s and BWS) and hotels. Woolworths selldown The supermarket business is going to sell 5% of Woolworths’ shares via a block trade at $5.22 per share, generating proceeds of $468 million. After this sale, Woolworths’ holding of Endeavour Group will be 4.1%. Woolworths Group has committed to retain its remaining Endeavour Group shares for at least 60 calendar days, subject to “customary exceptions”. Should owners of Endeavour Group shares worry? The supermarket business said it “does not possess any information that is generally available that a reasonable person would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of Endeavour Group securities”. Is Woolworths expecting the Endeavour share price to fall? Does it think it’s overvalued? It’s still holding a very sizeable amount of Endeavour shares, so keep that in mind. What’s going to happen with the money? Woolworths said it intends to use the proceeds of the sale to return capital to shareholders and will provide an update at the company’s FY24 result which will be delivered in August. When a business says a return of capital, it usually means by paying a (special) dividend and/or carrying out a share buyback . Management commentary The Woolworths CEO Brad Banducci said: While Woolworths Group and Endeavour Group remain important business partners, with a number of long term partnership agreements in place, we no longer believe that a material equity investment in Endeavour Group is required as Endeavour Group approaches its three-year anniversary as an independent listed company. As a result, we have decided to reduce our stake below 5% with the intention to use the proceeds to return capital to shareholders. We currently have no intention to sell the remaining stake, but will continue to assess what we believe is in the best interests of Woolworths Group shareholders. Final thoughts on the Woolworths share price The Woolworths share price had dropped close to 20% over the last 12 months before this announcement. The news of a dividend/ buyback may help investor confidence. If interested in Woolworths shares, I think this could be a good time to think about the business with its share price now a lot lower than it was a year ago. That’s appealing for a defensive business amid the ASX share market being close to the all-time high. The relative value is better. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

It is a medical equipment company that provides cloud-connectable continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machines for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). If Resmed’s name or financial reports look different it’s because Resmed’s ASX shares are CDIs and its primary listing is the NYSE. Resmed operates on a global scale, with 10,000+ employees and a presence in over 140 countries. It has two primary business units: Sleep and Respiratory Care, and Software as a Service (SaaS). Within Sleep and Respiratory Care, ResMed provides industry-leading CPAP machines for sleep apnea. Other devices are often marketed in this space but CPAP is the most effective therapy for all severities of OSA. The Respiratory Care unit covers patients ranging from those who only require therapy from CPAP systems at night to those who are dependent on non-invasive or invasive ventilation for life-support. Within the SaaS unit Resmed providers that assists durable or home medical equipment (DME/HME). Basically, it assists in out-of-hospital care. Due to Resmed’s large digital health network powered by its cloud-connected devices, Resmed can leverage its industry-leading hardware (e.g. masks and humidifiers) and its SaaS data to drive insights, improve outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs. While it may be large, Resmed CDI is a growth stock, and so it requires a different set of rules and may not be simple hard to value, at times. Studies have shown that over 5-10+ years, it’s top-line revenue growth which explains a stock’s performance. That’s why it’s good to see Resmed CDI is able to growth revenue at 12.6%, a good clip. WOW share price Founded in 1924, Woolworths is a retail operator in Australia and New Zealand with over 3,000 stores and over 100,000 employees. It is currently the Australia’s largest company in terms of revenue and market share. Woolworths’ main operations include supermarkets (under the Woolworths brand in Australia and Countdown in New Zealand), retailing through its discount department stores under the Big W brand, and business-to-business (B2B) brands like PFD. Overwhelmingly, it’s 35%+ share of Australian supermarkets is its crown jewel. Woolworths is a very popular choice for many ASX investors seeking dividend income. It consistently pays a fully franked dividend, usually at a yield of over 3%, and offers a very defensive earnings stream. It’s competitive advantage is probably best summarised as scale (distribution, low costs, etc.) and proximity (most shoppers still shop based on distance to the supermarket). Share price valuation As a growth company, the way to put a rough forecast on the RMD share price could be to compare its price-to-sales multiple over time. Currently, Resmed CDI shares have a price-sales ratio of 5.01x, which compares to its 5-year average of 7.81x, meaning its shares are trading below their historical average. Please keep in mind that context is important – and this is just one valuation technique. I wouldn’t make a decision based on one metric. Since it is a more mature-style business, the WOW share price is offering a historical dividend yield of around 3.27%, which compares to its 5-year average of 2.66%. The Rask websites, especially our Rask Education platform, offer free tutorials explaining Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). Both of these models would be a better way to value the WOW share price. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio. Imagine earning 4%, 5% — or more — in dividend passive income from the best shares, LICs, or ETFs… it’s like magic. So how do the best investors do it?

Soul Pattinson (WHSP) is an investment company with a diversified portfolio of assets across a range of industries and asset classes. Some of SOL’s largest holdings include stakes in other well-known publicly listed companies such as TPG Telecom ( ASX: TPG ), New Hope Group ( ASX: NHC ) and a cross shareholding in Brickworks ( ASX: BKW ). SOL’s mission is to deliver superior returns to its shareholders by creating capital growth and steadily increasing dividends as a holding company. It’s the second-oldest publicly listed company on the ASX and has a strong track record of capital growth and dividends. It should be thought of as family-run LIC, for the benefit of all shareholders (who are deeply aligned). COL share price Coles is an Australian retailer providing customers with everyday products including fresh food, groceries, general merchandise, liquor, fuel and financial services. It was founded in 1914 in Victoria, where its HQ still remain. Coles was formerly owned by conglomerate Wesfarmers from 2007 until 2018, when it was spun-off and listed as a separate entity on the ASX under the ticker symbol ‘COL’. Coles’ earnings are dominated by the supermarkets side of the business, however, it partly or fully owns or operates adjacent businesses like flybuys, Liquorland, First Choice, Vintage Cellars, Coles Express and more. Every week millions of Australians choose to shop for essential food and drink at Coles because of its prices, range and location. While it is the smaller brother of Woolworths, which has nearly 40% market share, Coles isn’t too far behind, with about 28%. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘quick read’ of where the SOL share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, Washington H Sl Pttnsn nd Cmpny Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 2.88%, which compares to its 5-year average of 2.54%. Put simply, SOL shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield.

BHP and Anglo American are two of the largest miners in the world. Both have iron ore and copper mining assets, and exposure to other commodities. Takeover rejected The Anglo-American board provided a response late last week to BHP’s “unsolicited, non-binding and highly conditional” merger proposal from BHP. As a reminder, the proposal was an all-share offer by BHP to buy Anglo American with a requirement for Anglo American to complete two separate demergers of its entire shareholdings of Anglo American Platinum and Kumba Iron Ore to Anglo American shareholders. The all-share offer and required demergers that would be inter-conditional. Anglo American considered the proposal with its advisers and concluded that the proposal “significantly undervalues Anglo American and its future prospects.” On top of that, the proposal “contemplates a structure which the board believes is highly unattractive for Anglo American’s shareholders, given the uncertainty and complexity inherent in the proposal, and significant execution risks.” Therefore, the board of Anglo American rejected the offer. Leadership comments Stuart Chambers, Chair of Anglo American , said: Anglo American is well positioned to create significant value from its portfolio of high quality assets that are well aligned with the energy transition and other major demand trends. With copper representing 30% of Anglo American’s total production, and with the benefit of well-sequenced and value-accretive growth options in copper and other structurally attractive products, the board believes that Anglo American’s shareholders stand to benefit from what we expect to be significant value appreciation as the full impact of those trends materialises. The BHP proposal is opportunistic and fails to value Anglo American’s prospects, while significantly diluting the relative value upside participation of Anglo American’s shareholders relative to BHP’s shareholders. Final thoughts on the BHP share price I can understand why Anglo American rejected the offer – it’s not obligated to accept an offer it thinks undervalues the business. If BHP has to pay a lot more, it would dilute the attractiveness of the deal. There are other copper assets out there which BHP could pursue, though there aren’t that many of large scale. If I were BHP, I’d spend a bit more of exploring for copper to try to find a mines it can build itself without having to pay such a large premium. For me, Rio Tinto Ltd ( ASX: RIO ) are currently a more appealing choice for a copper play.

Resmed is best known for its masks and devices that help people suffering with sleep apnea. It also has a growing software segment. Resmed’s strong quarter For the third quarter of FY24, the business saw revenue growth of 7% to US$1.2 billion. The Resmed gross profit margin grew 260 basis points (2.60%) to 57.9%, while the underlying (non-GAAP) gross profit margin increased 240 basis points (2.40%) to 58.5%. The company’s operating net profit (income from operations) increased 25% to $374.6 million, while underlying net profit rose 23% to $393.6 million. Statutory net profit rose 29% to $300.5 million. Resmed’s operating cash flow was $402 million, with debt repayments of $220 million for the quarter. The business also reported it made profit / earnings per share (EPS) of $2.04 and underlying EPS of $2.13. Profit is usually the most important thing when considering Resmed shares, or any profitable business. During the quarter, it also paid $70 million in dividends and repurchased 261,000 shares for $50 million as part of its ongoing capital management. Resmed also highlighted that with World Sleep Day, a global campaign was done to raise awareness of the importance of good sleep. A survey of 36,000 people across 17 markets showed half of respondents reported feeling excess daytime sleepiness and 40% reported getting no more than three nights of good sleep per week. More than one-third of respondents are now actively tracking their sleep patterns. Management commentary The Resmed CEO and Chair Mick Farrell said: ResMed’s strong third-quarter fiscal year 2024 results reflect robust patient and customer demand for our products and software solutions, leading to double-digit mask and accessories revenue growth along with ongoing operational efficiencies to drive margin improvement and increased profitability, resulting in double-digit growth in both operating profit and earnings per share. Over 2 billion people worldwide can benefit from a ResMed solution to help them sleep better, breathe better, and receive best in-class healthcare right where they live.

Final thoughts on the Resmed share price Resmed shares have made an incredible recovery over the past six months, rising by 36%. It has done a good job of pushing away worries about weight loss drugs, it’s clear the company is continuing to display good earnings growth. The question is – how much can earnings grow over the long-term? I’m not sure, it’s for me to predict long-term healthcare trends.

In FY23, Woolworths Group Ltd had an ROIC of 13.20% and revenue has compounded at 6.6% in recent years. Anything over 10% ROIC is pretty good for a mature-style business, since its cost of capital is likely below that level, so Woolworths Group Ltd crosses this hurdle. CSL share price CSL is a global biotechnology company that develops and delivers innovative medicines that save lives, protect public health and help people with life-threatening medical conditions live full lives. The company is divided into three main business units: CSL Behring, CSL Seqirus and CSL Vifor. Behring, acquired in 2004, manufactures and distributes blood plasma products. Seqirus was formed by a rebranding of BioCSL and the acquired Novartis flu business (bought in 2015) makes flu-related products and performs pandemic-related services for Governments. Finally, Vifor makes products for iron deficiency and nephrology (renal/kidney care). As previously mentioned, CSL’s plasma collection unit creates life-saving treatments for those will serious illnesses globally.

BHP is a miner which is involved with a number of commodities including iron, copper, coal and nickel. Takeover bid for Anglo American BHP confirmed today it has made a proposal to Anglo American on 16 April 2024 to the board of directors. The proposal is an all-share offer for Anglo American, as long as the UK-listed company divests its shareholdings in Anglo American Platinum and Kumba Iron Ore to Anglo American shareholders before the deal completes. So, the proposal is that Anglo American shareholders would receive 0.7097 BHP shares for each Anglo American share, and ordinary shares in Anglo Platinum and Kumba. Based on the market prices of 23 April 2024, which is the last day before media speculation, BHP said the offer is a total value of approximately £25.08 per Anglo American share, including £4.86 in Anglo Platinum shares and £3.40 in Kumba shares, valuing the business at £31.1 billion. Anglo American’s other high-quality operations, including the diamond business, would be subject to a strategic review after completion of the deal. At this stage, the proposal is non-binding and subject to customary conditions, including completing due diligence. Anglo American has been offered due diligence on BHP. Why does BHP want to do this deal? The ASX miner said this deal is consistent with its desire to create long-term value, and this deal is attractive for shareholders. It would increase BHP’s exposure to future-facing commodities through Anglo American’s “world class” copper assets and provide increased diversification of the operating footprint. Next, it would complement BHP’s iron ore and metallurgical coal portfolios with Anglo American’s high-quality iron ore operations in Brazil and Metallurgical coal assets in Queensland. BHP also believes it can achieve “meaningful synergies”, meaning the combined business can have lower costs and make more profit together. Final thoughts on the BHP share price This seems like a smart move by the company, it could result in a significant increase of its copper exposure and grow the scale of the business. Copper has an appealing long-term outlook because of the world’s decarbonisation work, as well as an expected supply deficit for how much demand there is this decade (and beyond). I wouldn’t call BHP a buy just because of this, I’d prefer to buy when the iron ore price is weaker. But, increased copper exposure seems like a good thing, so I’d be happy as a shareholder.

It was founded in 1914 in Victoria, where its HQ still remain. Coles was formerly owned by conglomerate Wesfarmers from 2007 until 2018, when it was spun-off and listed as a separate entity on the ASX under the ticker symbol ‘COL’. Coles’ earnings are dominated by the supermarkets side of the business, however, it partly or fully owns or operates adjacent businesses like flybuys, Liquorland, First Choice, Vintage Cellars, Coles Express and more. Every week millions of Australians choose to shop for essential food and drink at Coles because of its prices, range and location. While it is the smaller brother of Woolworths, which has nearly 40% market share, Coles isn’t too far behind, with about 28%. PLS share price Pilbara Minerals is a leading ASX-listed lithium company, owning 100% of the world’s largest, independent hard-rock lithium operation, Pilgangoora, which it acquired in 2014. Pilbara’s primary business is to, put simply, find, dig up and sell spodumene concentrate. It sells its concentrate through “offtake” agreements and spot sales on the Battery Material Exchange (BMX) platform. A good example of an offtake partner is Great Wall (the Chinese car company) or POSCO, a South Korean company. Pilbara has overcome significant hurdles to become a leader in lithium mining in Australia. However, as a commodities producer, its revenue is still at the mercy of (sometimes dramatic) fluctuations in the price of spodumene in the global market. Even still, bulls would say it’s a ‘pure play’ investment on demand for electric vehicles and battery tech. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘quick read’ of where the COL share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, Coles Group Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 4.02%, which compares to its 5-year average of 3.82%. Put simply, COL shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield. The PLS share price trades at a price-sales ratio of 2.81x, which compares to its 5-year long-term average of 6.53x. So, PLS shares are trading below their historical average. However, please do more investigating than a simple multiple like this.

It mainly has operations across Australia and New Zealand, operating in retail, chemical, fertiliser, industrial and safety products. It’s easy to think of Wesfarmers like a publicly listed private equity company. It has a long history of buying businesses, benefitting from their cash flows, re-investing in them and then selling them for a more attractive price. A good example of this might be Coles Group, which is bought in 2007 and spun out in 2018. However, by far (over 50%) of the company’s operating profit comes from Bunnings, the #1 hardware and home improvement business in Australia. It bought the remaining 52% of Bunnings that it didn’t own in 1994 for $594 million. Other brands include Kmart, Target, Officeworks, Blackwoods and Priceline Pharmacy. Wesfarmers has long been considered a leading blue chip stock for the average ASX share portfolio. Wesfarmers has quality assets such as Bunnings, Kmart and Officeworks and pays a consistent dividend to its shareholders. REA share price Founded in 1995, REA Group is a Melbourne-based real estate advertising company that is majority owned by News Corp. In Australia, it operates through its Realestate.com.au platform. REA Group operates on a global scale and now operates property websites in around 10 countries used by some 20,000 agents. In a typical month, the core Australian website gets over 55 million visits. The business is broken down across geographic lines, with Australia taking the lion’s share of revenue. Within Australia, REA makes money by listing properties for sale or rent (i.e. the agent uses REA’s website to show properties, which the property owner is on the hook to pay). It also makes money from financial services (e.g. mortgage broking), but this is a much smaller part of the business. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘quick read’ of where the WES share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, Wesfarmers Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 2.95%, which compares to its 5-year average of 3.84%. Put simply, WES shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield.

The company is divided into three main business units: CSL Behring, CSL Seqirus and CSL Vifor. Behring, acquired in 2004, manufactures and distributes blood plasma products. Seqirus was formed by a rebranding of BioCSL and the acquired Novartis flu business (bought in 2015) makes flu-related products and performs pandemic-related services for Governments. Finally, Vifor makes products for iron deficiency and nephrology (renal/kidney care). As previously mentioned, CSL’s plasma collection unit creates life-saving treatments for those will serious illnesses globally. CSL relies on plasma and blood collections to perform its primary businesses; and acquisitions are increasingly part of the CSL business. Investors often use CSL as an indirect play on rising spending on healthcare. RMD share price Resmed was founded in 1989 by Peter Farrell in Australia but is now based in San Diego, California. It is a medical equipment company that provides cloud-connectable continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machines for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). If Resmed’s name or financial reports look different it’s because Resmed’s ASX shares are CDIs and its primary listing is the NYSE. Resmed operates on a global scale, with 10,000+ employees and a presence in over 140 countries. It has two primary business units: Sleep and Respiratory Care, and Software as a Service (SaaS). Within Sleep and Respiratory Care, ResMed provides industry-leading CPAP machines for sleep apnea. Other devices are often marketed in this space but CPAP is the most effective therapy for all severities of OSA. The Respiratory Care unit covers patients ranging from those who only require therapy from CPAP systems at night to those who are dependent on non-invasive or invasive ventilation for life-support. Within the SaaS unit Resmed providers that assists durable or home medical equipment (DME/HME). Basically, it assists in out-of-hospital care. Due to Resmed’s large digital health network powered by its cloud-connected devices, Resmed can leverage its industry-leading hardware (e.g. masks and humidifiers) and its SaaS data to drive insights, improve outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs.

{"source_name": "RaskMedia", "title": "Why is the BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP) share price down today?", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/04/26/why-is-the-bhp-group-ltd-asx-bhp-share-price-down-today/", "publisher_name": "Luke Laretive", "published_date": "April 26, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu The BHP share price is down ~4% in early trade today after revealing an A$59 billion bid (£31 billion) for the UK-listed miner Anglo American plc (LON: AAL). BHP takeover proposal BHP confirmed it made an all share bid to the Anglo American board on 16 April 2024, offering 0.7097 BHP shares per Anglo share.  The market has responded negatively to BHP, with the shares dropping 4%, compared to Anglo shares jumping 14%.  Anglo American shares are up 18.6% in the last 5 days, contributing to the strong FTSE Index performance overnight, up 0.5% for the day. BHP has reportedly been on the lookout for a takeover of a smaller mining company for some time, utilising its strong balance sheet which is currently geared at 0.48x net debt/ EBITDA . BHP management and board under pressure as their future facing commodities strategy has yet to bear significant fruit.  Nickel has been in the doldrums, with BHP’s Nickel West operations resorting to pleading for government support to prevent shutting down operations.  Potash has been a slow mover with the monster capex Jansen potash project in Canada a risk of disappointing the market.  This leaves copper, which has enjoyed stronger commodity price conditions and has caused BHP to double down on its copper growth strategy. BHP is already the largest miner in the world, before undertaking one of its biggest acquisitions ever. The deal would have major ramifications for the construction of ASX indices. BHP currently comprises approximately 10% of the S&P/ASX 200 ( INDEXASX: XJO ) index, dictating the weight that passive funds hold in BHP shares. About Anglo American Anglo American is a global miner diversified across multiple commodities.  BHP is particularly focused on its copper assets, which produce ~790,000 tonnes of copper at low unit costs of US$1.57/lb on an annualised basis. Anglo’s coking coal mines in the Bowen Basin in Queensland, Australia may be of interest to BHP also, producing ~16Mtpa of hard coking coal from the Moranbah North, Grosvenor, Dawson, Capcoal, and Aquila mines.  These mines could be of interest to BHP, despite recently divesting coal mines in Queensland to ASX-listed coal mining specialists Whitehaven Coal Ltd ( ASX: WHC ) and Stanmore Resources Ltd ( ASX: SMR ).  However, given Mike Henry’s background in coal trading and the ~15Mtpa of spare capacity at BMA’s Hay Point’s ~55Mtpa export terminal), there is room in the portfolio for high quality coal assets, which BHP management can position as amenable to ‘greener steel’ production due to their premium (low impurity) hard coking coal product specifications produced being lower carbon emissions, aligning with BHP’s strategy. The transaction is conditional on the proposed divestiture of Anglo’s platinum (Amplats, Sakatti), iron ore (40mtpa across South Africa and Brazil) and diamond (De Beers) operations, which are seen as non-core to BHP.  South African Manganese assets would also likely be non-core, given BHP’s history of spinning off base metal assets into South32 Ltd ( ASX: S32 ). BHP’s rationale for acquisition: Seneca’s interpretation BHP is swooping in when the Anglo American share price is cyclically depressed, having lagged mining peers by 20%+ (prior to the bid announcement) since April 2023. Source: Factset BHP has made it clear that it intends to grow its copper exposure as a future facing commodity.  The OZ Minerals takeover reinforced this view.  Anglo American’s existing copper production of >700,000 tonnes per annum from huge copper porphyry mines in Chile and Peru could be worth as much as US$35 billion when compared to global copper miners such as Southern Copper Corp (NYSE: SCCO), Freeport-McMoRan Inc ( NYSE: FCX ), Zijin Mining Group, Ivanhoe Mines Ltd (TSE: IVN), and Lundin Mining Corp (TSE: LUN). Aside from the obvious winners of the deal (the bankers – given all the spinoffs!), we think the deal has the potential to be accretive for BHP from day 1, from the copper alone.  It would transform BHP into the largest copper producer globally, head and shoulders above the rest of the pack. Source: Bloomberg What happens next? It is worth noting that the takeover bid is currently being reviewed by the Anglo board and there is no certainty that a deal eventuates. We think Glencore PLC (LON: GLEN) and Rio Tinto Ltd ( ASX: RIO ) will be keeping a close eye on the deal and possibly getting involved.  Anglo American’s CEO Duncan Wanblad discussed the potential merits of a merger with Glencore on an earnings call just two months ago, particularly related to the North Chilean Collahuasi copper mine (44% Anglo, 44% Glencore, 12% Japanese consortium).  Although BHP’s balance sheet is stronger than Glencore’s, which currently holds ~$12 billion in net debt. In the meantime, we won’t have to wait long for progress on the deal.  UK share market rules dictate that BHP has until 22 May 2024 to make its bid firm or walk away. Are BHP shares a buy today? We own BHP shares in the Seneca Australian Shares SMA , although we are underweight relative to the index.  We also own RIO shares, and are exposed to other commodities, including through Pilbara Minerals Ltd ( ASX: PLS ).

We believe its competitive advantge is that of any other established platform: network effects and efficient scale. In other words, Domain (the #2 player) is meaningfully behind REA in users and views, which means REA can continue to charge more. BHP share price BHP Group (formerly BHP Billiton) is a diversified natural resources company producing commodities that was founded in 1885. BHP’s principal business lines are mineral exploration and production. BHP’s assets, operations and interests are separated into three focus areas: Copper and related minerals (e.g. gold, uranium, silver, zinc, etc.), Iron Ore, and Coal (i.e. metallurgical and energy). Share price valuation As a growth company, the way to put a rough guesstimate on the REA share price could be to compare its price-to-sales multiple over time. Currently, Rea Group Ltd shares have a price-sales ratio of 17.21x, which compares to its 5-year average of 12.29x, meaning its shares are trading higher than their historical average. Please keep in mind that context is important – and this is just one valuation technique. I wouldn’t make a decision based on one metric. Since it is a more mature-style business, the BHP share price is offering a historical dividend yield of around 5.73%, which compares to its 5-year average of 9.38%. The Rask websites, especially our Rask Education platform, offer free tutorials explaining Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). Both of these models would be a better way to value the BHP share price. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

{"source_name": "RaskMedia", "title": "Kogan (ASX:KGN) share price sinks 25% after March quarter update", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/04/24/kogan-asxkgn-share-price-sinks-25-after-march-quarter-update/", "publisher_name": "Jaz Harrison", "published_date": "April 24, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu The Kogan.com Ltd ( ASX: KGN ) share price has fallen around 25% after the e-commerce retailer announced its March quarterly update. March 2024 quarter It reported gross sales declined 6.2% to $178.3 million, after a “recalibration” of its revenue, and a focus on platform-based sales, which resulted in a “significant reduction in inventories year on year” as it aims to be a more capital-light business. The gross profit increased 13.8% to $39 million, thanks to an improved gross profit margin which improved by 5.2 percentage points to 36.8%. There was a larger contribution of platform-based sales and improved profitability of in-warehouse inventory sales after the prior sell-through of excess inventory. Platform-based sales contributed 61.6% of gross sales, with the advertising platform continuing to grow – it generated $0.8 million of revenue in the period. Group active customers came to 2.66 million, while Kogan First subscribers rose 16% year on year to 472,000 at 31 March 2024. The Kogan FIRST membership cost has been increased from $99 to $129 on 8 April 2024. The adjusted EBITDA generated was $9 million, up from $4.4 million in the FY23 third quarter. Kogan’s adjusted EBIT improved to $5.3 million, up from $0.2 million. Profit is a key thing for the Kogan share price. At the end of the quarter, the business had cash of $34.1 million and no debt. Its inventory balance came to $71.1 million, a year on year reduction of 9.2%. Management commentary The Kogan founder and CEO Ruslan Kogan announced another development for the Kogan website to include travel. He said: I’m excited to announce today that we continue to grow the benefits through the program, launching Kogan Travel hotel deals. As of today, Kogan Travel now offers the best value domestic and international hotel stays and packages with exclusive pricing for Kogan FIRST Subscribers. If you have some travel coming up, we encourage you to compare our prices and start saving. Final thoughts on the Kogan share price This seems like a big sell-off considering Kogan still made a profit. The cash position did reduce, so it’ll be interesting to see how that performs in final three months to June 2024. Disappointingly, most of its main segments (Kogan Marketplace, exclusive brands, Mighty Ape and third-party brands) all saw a decline of sales. I’d want to see a return to growth in the coming months. It may be changing strategy, but I want to see sales growth after it stops cycling against the ‘old’ strategy. It may well be oversold on a long-term view, but it does seem to regularly disappoint investors. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio. Imagine earning 4%, 5% — or more — in dividend passive income from the best shares, LICs, or ETFs… it’s like magic. So how do the best investors do it?

{"source_name": "RaskMedia", "title": "The BHP Group Ltd (ASX:BHP) share price and Wesfarmers Ltd (ASX:WES) share price are worth watching", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/04/25/the-bhp-group-ltd-asxbhp-share-price-and-wesfarmers-ltd-asxwes-share-price-are-worth-watching-9/", "publisher_name": "Rask ASX News Team", "published_date": "April 25, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu BHP share price BHP Group (formerly BHP Billiton) is a diversified natural resources company producing commodities that was founded in 1885. BHP’s principal business lines are mineral exploration and production. BHP’s assets, operations and interests are separated into three focus areas: Copper and related minerals (e.g. gold, uranium, silver, zinc, etc.), Iron Ore, and Coal (i.e. metallurgical and energy). BHP shares are often seen as a reliable dividend paying investment and is a common constituent of an ASX share portfolio. If you own an popular ETF or LIC, or invest with Industry Super, chances are you have exposure. Since we consider BHP Group Ltd to be a blue chip stock, or a mature business, we like to look at things like return on invested capital (ROIC) and revenue growth as signs of sustainability. In FY23, BHP Group Ltd had an ROIC of 28.10% and revenue has compounded at 22.7% in recent years. Anything over 10% ROIC is pretty strong for a mature-style business, since its cost of capital is likely below that level, so BHP Group Ltd crosses this hurdle. WES share price Founded in 1914, Wesfarmers is an Australian conglomerate headquartered in Perth. It mainly has operations across Australia and New Zealand, operating in retail, chemical, fertiliser, industrial and safety products. It’s easy to think of Wesfarmers like a publicly listed private equity company. It has a long history of buying businesses, benefitting from their cash flows, re-investing in them and then selling them for a more attractive price. A good example of this might be Coles Group, which is bought in 2007 and spun out in 2018. However, by far (over 50%) of the company’s operating profit comes from Bunnings, the #1 hardware and home improvement business in Australia. It bought the remaining 52% of Bunnings that it didn’t own in 1994 for $594 million. Other brands include Kmart, Target, Officeworks, Blackwoods and Priceline Pharmacy. Wesfarmers has long been considered a leading blue chip stock for the average ASX share portfolio. Wesfarmers has quality assets such as Bunnings, Kmart and Officeworks and pays a consistent dividend to its shareholders. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘speedy read’ of where the BHP share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, BHP Group Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 5.77%, which compares to its 5-year average of 9.38%. Put simply, BHP shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield. Since it is a more mature-style business, the WES share price is offering a historical dividend yield of around 2.92%, which compares to its 5-year average of 3.84%. The Rask websites, especially our Rask Education platform, offer free tutorials explaining Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). Both of these models would be a better way to value the WES share price. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio. Imagine earning 4%, 5% — or more — in dividend passive income from the best shares, LICs, or ETFs… it’s like magic. So how do the best investors do it?

It is a medical equipment company that provides cloud-connectable continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machines for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). If Resmed’s name or financial reports look different it’s because Resmed’s ASX shares are CDIs and its primary listing is the NYSE. Resmed operates on a global scale, with 10,000+ employees and a presence in over 140 countries. It has two primary business units: Sleep and Respiratory Care, and Software as a Service (SaaS). Within Sleep and Respiratory Care, ResMed provides industry-leading CPAP machines for sleep apnea. Other devices are often marketed in this space but CPAP is the most effective therapy for all severities of OSA. The Respiratory Care unit covers patients ranging from those who only require therapy from CPAP systems at night to those who are dependent on non-invasive or invasive ventilation for life-support. Within the SaaS unit Resmed providers that assists durable or home medical equipment (DME/HME). Basically, it assists in out-of-hospital care. Due to Resmed’s large digital health network powered by its cloud-connected devices, Resmed can leverage its industry-leading hardware (e.g. masks and humidifiers) and its SaaS data to drive insights, improve outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs. WOW share price Founded in 1924, Woolworths is a retail operator in Australia and New Zealand with over 3,000 stores and over 100,000 employees. It is currently the Australia’s largest company in terms of revenue and market share. Woolworths’ main operations include supermarkets (under the Woolworths brand in Australia and Countdown in New Zealand), retailing through its discount department stores under the Big W brand, and business-to-business (B2B) brands like PFD. Overwhelmingly, it’s 35%+ share of Australian supermarkets is its crown jewel. Woolworths is a very popular choice for many ASX investors seeking dividend income. It consistently pays a fully franked dividend, usually at a yield of over 3%, and offers a very defensive earnings stream. It’s competitive advantage is probably best summarised as scale (distribution, low costs, etc.) and proximity (most shoppers still shop based on distance to the supermarket). Share price valuation As a growth company, the way to put a broad projection on the RMD share price could be to compare its price-to-sales multiple over time. Currently, Resmed CDI shares have a price-sales ratio of 4.27x, which compares to its 5-year average of 7.81x, meaning its shares are trading below their historical average. Please keep in mind that context is important – and this is just one valuation technique. I wouldn’t make a decision based on one metric. Since it is a more mature-style business, the WOW share price is offering a historical dividend yield of around 3.24%, which compares to its 5-year average of 2.66%. The Rask websites, especially our Rask Education platform, offer free tutorials explaining Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM).

ResMed’s 3Q24 gave investors an update on the health of the business and suggests profit for the full year FY2024 is likely to beat consensus expectations. Resmed results Resmed reported net profit up +29% to US$300.5 million, on sales +7% to US$1.2 billion.  The result beat earnings expectations by 9%, with RMD shares responding positively. ResMed is a world leader in devices and technology for the treatment of sleep apnea. It sells sleep apnea devices, consumables (masks), and software to customers all around the world.  Thanks to this ‘razor and blades’ business model, Resmed generates 20% return on invested capital (ROIC), a key metric for future shareholder returns. Gross margins climbed by 260bps to 57.9%, thanks to double-digit mask and accessory growth (higher margin, recurring revenues).  Gross margins have been a key area of focus for the share market analyst community, with margin compression thanks to chip shortages, freight, FX headwinds and labour costs experienced last year being a contributor to underperformance . Another highlight of the result was operating cashflow of $402m, enabling debt repayments of $220m and a dividend of 4.8 US cents per share (RMD shares typically pay unfranked dividends each quarter). Outlook positive despite initial fears from weight loss drug narrative The RMD Share price came under pressure in 2023 amid fears that GLP-1 weight loss drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro from the likes of global pharmaceutical giants Novo Nordisk A/S (CPH: NOVO-B) and Eli Lilly And Co ( NYSE: LLY ) would reduce the requirement for CPAP machines due to obesity’s correlation with sleep apnea. We outlined why we thought these fears were overplayed for Rask in August 2023 , a few weeks before the ultimate share price low. In reality, the company has reiterated that reiterated its expectations that GLP-1s will be a tailwind for its sleep business as people prescribed weight loss drugs are often also recommended Resmed CPAP machines to help with sleep apnea.  This helps Resmed fill up the customer funnel in what is an underpenetrated sleep apnea market. We see the positive long term outlook for Resmed as intact for 2 reasons: Are Resmed (RMD) shares a buy today? Resmed’s valuation of 22x forward P/E is modest (historical average 28x) given the quality of the business and growth prospects.  Resmed has delivered revenue growth of >8% in each of the last 8 years.  We continue to see RMD as a hold. Resmed has been a key active overweight position in the Seneca Australian Shares SMA .  RMD shares have outperformed the S&P/ASX 200 ( INDEXASX: XJO ) index by +22% since its low in September 2023.  If you’re interested in hearing more about our 5 largest overweight high conviction ASX shares, schedule a call with Luke today . 3 ASX dividend stocks in 2024 (I recommend to everyone) I’ve just released a special free report to Rask readers covering the 3 top ASX dividend stocks I recommend to EVERY INVESTOR in 2024.

In Australia, it operates through its Realestate.com.au platform. REA Group operates on a global scale and now operates property websites in around 10 countries used by some 20,000 agents. In a typical month, the core Australian website gets over 55 million visits. The business is broken down across geographic lines, with Australia taking the lion’s share of revenue. Within Australia, REA makes money by listing properties for sale or rent (i.e. the agent uses REA’s website to show properties, which the property owner is on the hook to pay). It also makes money from financial services (e.g. mortgage broking), but this is a much smaller part of the business. Property websites such as Realestate.com.au attract both buyers and sellers and aim to simplify the process resulting in an efficient and stress-free transaction. We believe its competitive advantge is that of any other established platform: network effects and efficient scale. In other words, Domain (the #2 player) is meaningfully behind REA in users and views, which means REA can continue to charge more. While it may be large, Rea Group Ltd is a growth stock, and so it requires a different set of rules and may not be straightforward hard to value, at times. Studies have shown that over 5-10+ years, it’s top-line revenue growth which explains a stock’s performance. That’s why it’s good to see Rea Group Ltd is able to growth revenue at 16.4%, a strong clip.

The company is divided into three main business units: CSL Behring, CSL Seqirus and CSL Vifor. Behring, acquired in 2004, manufactures and distributes blood plasma products. Seqirus was formed by a rebranding of BioCSL and the acquired Novartis flu business (bought in 2015) makes flu-related products and performs pandemic-related services for Governments. Finally, Vifor makes products for iron deficiency and nephrology (renal/kidney care). As previously mentioned, CSL’s plasma collection unit creates life-saving treatments for those will serious illnesses globally. CSL relies on plasma and blood collections to perform its primary businesses; and acquisitions are increasingly part of the CSL business. Investors often use CSL as an indirect play on rising spending on healthcare. Since we consider CSL Ltd to be a blue chip stock, or a mature business, we like to look at things like return on invested capital (ROIC) and revenue growth as signs of sustainability.

Due to Resmed’s large digital health network powered by its cloud-connected devices, Resmed can leverage its industry-leading hardware (e.g. masks and humidifiers) and its SaaS data to drive insights, improve outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘fast read’ of where the CSL share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, CSL Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 1.30%, which compares to its 5-year average of 1.24%. Put simply, CSL shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield. The RMD share price trades at a price-sales ratio of 4.28x, which compares to its 5-year long-term average of 7.81x. So, RMD shares are trading below their historical average. However, please do more investigating than a simple multiple like this. Our websites explain Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Dividend Discount Models (DDM), and many different ways to value a share, like Resmed CDI. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

Nick Scali operates Nick Scali and Plush stores in Australia. UK acquisition Nick Scali is buying Anglia Home Furnishings, trading as Fabb Furniture, for £2 (A$3.82) and all of the secured debt owed by the business for £3.5 million (A$6.7 million). The ASX share said it intends to pay £0.5 million (A$1 million) to exercise the option to exit the existing distribution centre arrangement. It’ll also provide a net working capital injection of up to £6 million (A$11.5 million). This business was founded in 1979 and has a network of 21 stores across the UK, all located in out-of-town retail parks, mostly in a large-scale format. What are Nick Scali’s plans? This gives the furniture retailer entry into the “large and attractive” UK market. It allows the ASX share to expand its brand into the UK at scale at a relatively low cost. It also opens up a “significant opportunity to drive profitable growth in the medium-term”. Fab Furniture’s gross profit margin is estimated to be approximately 10 percentage points lower than UK competitors on a like for like basis, so there’s plenty of potential for an increase in profit. Nick Scali believes the company can leverage its buying power, combined with its supply chain and logistics capabilities, to help improve margins, just like it has done with Plush. Capital raising Nick Scali is doing a $50 million capital raising , with a $46 million placement to institutional investors. It’s issuing new Nick Scali shares. There will be a $4 million conditional placement to CEO and Managing Director Anthony Scali, subject to shareholder approval being sought at the company’s AGM (expected in October 2024). The placement will be done at a share price of A$13.25, which is a 5.8% discount to the last closing price (yesterday). It will also conduct a non-underwritten share purchase plan (SPP) to raise around A$10 million where regular investors can buy up to A$30,000 each. All eligible Nick Scali directors intend to participate. Final thoughts on Nick Scali shares This seems like a logical, and good, move by the business. It has been thinking about expansion into the UK for a while, and this seems like a fairly cheap way to achieve the move. The UK market is large, so there’s plenty of potential for earnings growth there. I think Nick Scali is more appealing as a result of this, though I’d prefer to invest when the market is fearful about retail spending.

{"source_name": "RaskMedia", "title": "In 2024, I’m looking at the PLS share price", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/04/24/in-2024-im-looking-at-the-pls-share-price-9/", "publisher_name": "Rask ASX News Team", "published_date": "April 24, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu PLS share price Pilbara Minerals is a leading ASX-listed lithium company, owning 100% of the world’s largest, independent hard-rock lithium operation, Pilgangoora, which it acquired in 2014. Pilbara’s primary business is to, put simply, find, dig up and sell spodumene concentrate. It sells its concentrate through “offtake” agreements and spot sales on the Battery Material Exchange (BMX) platform. A good example of an offtake partner is Great Wall (the Chinese car company) or POSCO, a South Korean company. Pilbara has overcome significant hurdles to become a leader in lithium mining in Australia. However, as a commodities producer, its revenue is still at the mercy of (sometimes dramatic) fluctuations in the price of spodumene in the global market. Even still, bulls would say it’s a ‘pure play’ investment on demand for electric vehicles and battery tech. SOL share price Founded in 1903, Washington H. Soul Pattinson (WHSP) is an investment company with a diversified portfolio of assets across a range of industries and asset classes. Some of SOL’s largest holdings include stakes in other well-known publicly listed companies such as TPG Telecom ( ASX: TPG ), New Hope Group ( ASX: NHC ) and a cross shareholding in Brickworks ( ASX: BKW ). SOL’s mission is to deliver superior returns to its shareholders by creating capital growth and steadily increasing dividends as a holding company. It’s the second-oldest publicly listed company on the ASX and has a strong track record of capital growth and dividends. It should be thought of as family-run LIC, for the benefit of all shareholders (who are deeply aligned). Share price valuation As a growth company, the way to put a broad estimate on the PLS share price could be to compare its price-to-sales multiple over time. Currently, Pilbara Minerals Ltd shares have a price-sales ratio of 2.85x, which compares to its 5-year average of 6.53x, meaning its shares are trading below their historical average. Please keep in mind that context is important – and this is just one valuation technique. I wouldn’t make a decision based on one metric. Since it is a more mature-style business, the SOL share price is offering a historical dividend yield of around 2.85%, which compares to its 5-year average of 2.54%. The Rask websites, especially our Rask Education platform, offer free tutorials explaining Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). Both of these models would be a better way to value the SOL share price. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

Fortescue is a major iron ore miner and it is also aiming to become a significant producer of green hydrogen and green ammonia. March 2024 quarter Fortescue reported total ore shipped of 43.3 mt, which was down 11% quarter on quarter and down 6% year on year because of the impact of an ore car derailment on 30 December 2023, and weather disruptions. However, the company did say shipments recovered during the quarter, with a record month for shipments of 18.7mt achieved in March 2024. Fortescue said its C1 (mining costs) were US$18.93 per wet metric tonnes, an increase of 7% compared to the second quarter of FY24 because of the lower sales volume. Fortescue’s average revenue per dry metric tonne (dmt) for its normal production was US$104, 85% of the average Platts 62% CFR Index. However, because its production is generally lower grade, it doesn’t receive as much revenue per tonne. Iron Bridge – a new high-quality iron project – concentrate revenue was US$145 per dmt, which was 107% of the average Platts 65% CFR Index. Green progress Fortescue said it successfully conducted the world’s first use of ammonia as a marine fuel aboard the Fortescue Green Power vessel. This month it announced a joint venture with OCP Group, which it described as the world leader in plant nutrition solutions and phosphate-based fertilisers, which aims to supply green hydrogen, ammonia and fertilisers to Morocco and international markets. Fortescue also opened its new Gladstone electrolyser facility in Queensland, with manufacturing capacity of more than 2GW per year. Fortescue’s first operational electric excavator has moved over 1 million tonnes of material since being commissioned. The battery electric haul truck prototype has completed its first phase of testing. Final thoughts on the Fortescue share price Unsurprisingly, Fortescue said its total shipments for FY24 is now expected to be at the lower end of its guidance of between 192mt to 197mt because of the derailment. But, that derailment is in the past – it’s not new news – and the company will hopefully be able to perform well from now on. I like what Fortescue is doing, which is why I’m a shareholder. It has major green energy ambitions, time will tell if it can produce as much as it wants to, and whether there is the customer demand for it (who are willing to pay a high price). The Fortescue share price has drifted lower in the last few months, but I wouldn’t choose to invest unless the iron ore price fell to a price where the market was fearful about the commodity (such as below US$100 per tonne). Until then, there are more predictable ASX dividend shares I’d rather buy. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

Sure, you’re glad they’re on the job, but you don’t really think about them, and you certainly wouldn’t buy a T-shirt with their face on it. And I get it: super can feel boring. However, with the right approach, it can become the hidden star of your Get Rich Slow tour. Because I want you to have every advantage in your quest for Financial Independence, my team at Pearler has created a superannuation resource guide . It doesn’t sell or promote anything – it only exists to give you some insight into your super. In this article, I’ve summarised some of my favourite resources from the page, so keep reading for an overview. Or, if you’d rather peruse every resource at your leisure, simply click this link . Superannuation basics: Why your super is super To begin, I recommend this podcast episode of Get Rich Slow Club. In this episode, co-hosts Tash Invests and Ana Kresina peel back the boring jargon of superannuation. They also provide a basic checklist for choosing a super fund, including fees and investment returns. Then, they shed light on different types of super contributions, other ways money goes to your super, and when you can access your super. When you’re sifting through super funds, there are several factors you need to consider: You’ve waded through the four essentials of selecting a super fund. Now comes the more exciting part: how to actually keep the fund growing to give you a wealthy and happy retirement. How much super should I have to retire comfortably? Since the introduction of the Superannuation Guarantee in 1992, Australians have been asking: “How much super should I have to retire?” There are two key factors to estimating how much super you’ll need to retire comfortably: 1. Your desired lifestyle 2. Expected costs to sustain that lifestyle Let’s look at both a little closer. What do you imagine retirement will look like for you? Maybe you plan to travel around the world, take up gardening, volunteer with charities, or write a novel. All these activities sound like great ways to spend retirement, but also vary considerably in their associated costs. Some have tried to calculate the average income needed to answer the question those of us with a long-term outlook are asking. Even so, no two people are the same. We see these universal suggestions, and we’re still left asking, “But how much super should I have?” Well, are you hoping for a comfortable or modest lifestyle in retirement? For some of us, it doesn’t take much to feel content. For others, we like to have nice things and don’t want that to stop when we retire. These lifestyle expectations should be considered when figuring out how much super you need to retire. Your expenses in retirement will be influenced by both your desired lifestyle and the other big costs you may incur. So, while you may take up a low-cost activity like writing a novel in retirement, you may plan to also pay off your mortgage. That’s too large a cost to overlook! Other big costs include: To help you estimate how much you’ll spend when you retire, give the MoneySmart budget planner a go. This also covers day-to-day costs like groceries, transport, clothes and social activities. According to MoneySmart, if you own your own home, you’ll need about two-thirds of your pre-retirement income to maintain the same living standard. So, how much super should I have? If your goal is to retire comfortably, it’s helpful to go further than relying on industry standards. Consider your unique lifestyle preferences, current income, expected costs, assets and personal situation. Pearler’s Financial Independence Calculator can help you do that. To read this article at your own pace, check it out on our blog. How should I divide my money between superannuation and shares? Not sure whether to put your money into your superannuation, shares or split across both? There are certain advantages and disadvantages to investing in either option, and it’s important to weigh these up before deciding. Before you choose where to put your money, ask yourself these crucial questions. Are you hoping to build a bigger nest egg to enjoy a more comfortable retirement in your 60s? If so, you may benefit from making extra contributions to your super . Or, are you planning to use your investment strategy to save up for, say, a house deposit? In that case, you might need more liquidity, which is why shares could be the more straightforward option. Think about what you’re ultimately aiming towards and consider this goal when deciding where to invest. Your investment horizon – how long you want to hold on to your investments – is another major factor. If you’re aiming to stop working at a younger age and achieve FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) , shares may provide you with more immediate returns. You can access your money whenever you choose, meaning you’re not restricted by the age limits imposed by the current superannuation rules. Alternatively, if you’re planning to retire around preservation age and have several decades ahead of you, you might be able to wait to access your investments. Start by working out roughly how much you expect to live on every year once you retire. There are various factors to consider here, including whether you own your home (and if you’re likely to continue paying off your mortgage during retirement) and what kind of lifestyle you want. Then, look at your current super balance and contributions and figure out whether you’re likely to meet your retirement target. Depending on how long you have until retirement, investing in either super or shares may make more sense. Want some help crunching these numbers? Try Pearler’s Financial Independence Calculator . As mentioned earlier, you might be investing for your immediate circumstances. Perhaps you want to fund your day-to-day or discretionary spending, or maybe you’ve got a shorter-term savings goal such as a holiday or home deposit. The money you put in shares can more or less be accessed whenever you want, whereas you’re not granted the same freedom with superannuation. We know there are limits on how much you can put into your super before being taxed at a much higher rate. There’s also an additional tax if you’re earning over $250,000. If you want to invest large amounts, share investing could potentially prove more lucrative. On the other hand, if you only want to invest a small amount, the fees associated with share investing might make your investment quite prohibitive. Shares are inherently riskier than super, so it’s well worth assessing your risk profile. This is effectively a measure of how much risk you’re willing to take on, and it helps you determine what to invest in and how much to invest. Generally speaking, the higher the risk, the higher the potential for strong returns. At the same time, there’s a higher chance of losing your money. If you have a low tolerance for risk, you may prefer more conservative and historically stable investments – like blue chip shares , diversified ETFs , or your super. But if you’ve got a higher risk appetite, you might be willing to put your money into more volatile investments like growth stocks or funds. There are also different tax implications for investing in super versus investing in shares. Chat to your accountant to see how either option will affect your tax position. At the end of the day, the decision on where to invest is entirely yours. You could put that extra money into your super as voluntary contributions, or you could invest in the share market. Or, you could do a mix of both – potentially allowing you to reap the benefits of each investment option while minimising the drawbacks. Seek advice from a licensed financial adviser who can guide you on the best investment strategy for your circumstances.

The Rask websites, especially our Rask Education platform, offer free tutorials explaining Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). Both of these models would be a better way to value the COL share price. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

{"source_name": "RaskMedia", "title": "Correction continues", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/04/23/correction-continues/", "publisher_name": "David Bassanese", "published_date": "April 23, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu Global markets – week in review The S&P 500 (INDEXSP: .INX) correction continued last week, with a solid US retail sales report and a hawkish tilt by Fed chair Powell further unsettling bond and equity markets. One market reprieve was signs that Iran is seeking to avoid further escalating its stoush with Israel. The US economic juggernaut rolls on, with March retail spending up 0.7% – much healthier than the 0.4% market expectation. As I warned last week: “Wall Street remains vulnerable to a deeper correction if the bad run on inflation continues and/or the Fed starts to sound more hawkish.” Last week the Fed did indeed turn hawkish – which should not be too much of a surprise after three consecutive higher-than-expected CPI reports. Fed chair Powell noted that recent data had not given him “greater confidence” that inflation is falling in a way that could justify rate cuts any time soon. This is likely a signal that he no longer thinks three rate cuts this year – as included in the latest dot plot forecasts – is appropriate. As is stands, the market is now expecting only one to two rate cuts later this year. The week ahead We’ll learn more on the US inflation front with the all-important consumption deflator on Friday. The market anticipates that both the headline and core measures rose 0.3% in March, which would see annual core inflation edge down from 2.8% to 2.6% but headline annual inflation edge higher from 2.5% to 2.6%. A higher number could see the market fully price out US rate cuts this year and potentially deepen the US equity market correction. Also this week, four of the Magnificent 7 companies [ Tesla Inc ( NASDAQ: TSLA ), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META), Alphabet Inc Class A ( NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT)] report Q1 earnings. Given jittery market sentiment and high tech valuations, any earnings disappointments are likely to be severely punished. Global equity trends Looking at global equity trends, the rebound in bond yields is helping drag back the relative performance of growth over value, as evident in the pullback in Nasdaq-100 (INDEXNASDAQ: NDX) relative performance. Japan has also pulled back, with Europe faring better. The extended period of Australia and emerging markets underperformance has bottomed out over this period. Australian markets The S&P/ASX 200 ( INDEXASX: XJO ) caught up with the global pullback last week, with a loss of 2.8%. Iron-ore prices bounced back after recent heavy losses, perhaps partly reflecting a stronger-than-expected Chinese Q1 GDP report. The main local highlight last week was another fairly solid labour market report, with an employment loss of only 7k in March after a supercharged 100k surge in February. The unemployment rate ticked up from 3.7% to a still low 3.8%. The key local highlight this week will be Wednesday’s March quarter consumer price index report. Of particular note, the trimmed mean measure of underlying inflation is expected to rise by 0.9% which – although a touch higher than the 0.8% in Q4 – would still be consistent with an easing in annual trimmed mean inflation from 4.2% to 3.9%. That said, with annualised underlying inflation still expected at around 4%, such a result would not be a green light for the RBA to shift to a more convincing easing bias any time soon.

Qantas is the leading airline in Australia not New Zealand, but we may be able to learn some things from what’s going on with the main airline from that country. Air New Zealand update The company has seen softening in revenue conditions over the fourth quarter both domestically and on the North American market. Domestic performance in New Zealand has seen “ongoing softening, with challenging economic conditions and ongoing cost-of-living pressures.” The company said government and corporate demand remains “subdued”. The company’s North American performance continues to be impacted by “very competitive pricing pressures, as the market adjusts to the significant capacity added into the New Zealand market by US carriers.” The weaker conditions are expected to result in lower underlying profitability for FY24 between $40 million to $50 million. Air New Zealand also pointed to the cumulative impact of significant inflation of the cost base. What can owners of Qantas shares take from this? New Zealand and Australia are two different markets with different economies and different airline demand. However, it’s not surprising to me that demand for air travel may be reducing because many households may be facing hard choices when it comes to their finances. A year or two ago, people had more money for travel. Now many budgets are tighter. Following the suppressed travel period due to COVID-19, people made up for lost time and travelled. How many more trips can people take? In New Zealand at least, that demand seems to be reducing. Flight demand may remain strong in Australia, and Qantas shares are not necessarily expensive on an earnings multiple basis. However, I’m not interested in buying the Aussie airline because it has rallied more than 10% in the last few weeks – it’s not as cheap. Plus, there’s a danger the oil price could increase because of the troubles in the Middle East. For me, there are other ASX dividend shares that could provide better returns. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

Investors continued the 180-degree about-face from last week’s sentiment, happy to take on risk for the second consecutive day to start this week seeing the ASX200 through a 200pt gain from Friday’s panic lows early in today’s session. Tech was the standout as US 2-yr yields retreated (marginally) from the spike above 5% last week while Healthcare and Financials also joined in the rebound. Energy and Gold were the main areas finding it tough again today, for the same geopolitical reasons as Monday’s session. NST -3.53%: the gold stocks struggled today alongside the price of the precious metal, and Northern Star’s 1Q update did little to stem the flow on NST shares. Northern Star sold 401koz of gold in the quarter, with an All In Sustaining Cost (AISC) of $1,844/oz. Weather and mill downtime impacted the quarter, with sales falling ~6% from 3Q23 and ~3% from the prior period as a result. Northern Star maintained FY24 guidance of 1.6-1.75moz of sales at an AISC of $1,810-1,860/oz implying the June quarter will have to be their best in FY24, selling at least 419koz just to meet the low end. They noted grades had improved in April while mill capacity had also increased – still, not much wiggle room at this stage.

It is currently the Australia’s largest company in terms of revenue and market share. Woolworths’ main operations include supermarkets (under the Woolworths brand in Australia and Countdown in New Zealand), retailing through its discount department stores under the Big W brand, and business-to-business (B2B) brands like PFD. Overwhelmingly, it’s 35%+ share of Australian supermarkets is its crown jewel. Woolworths is a very popular choice for many ASX investors seeking dividend income. It consistently pays a fully franked dividend, usually at a yield of over 3%, and offers a very defensive earnings stream. It’s competitive advantage is probably best summarised as scale (distribution, low costs, etc.) and proximity (most shoppers still shop based on distance to the supermarket). CSL share price CSL is a global biotechnology company that develops and delivers innovative medicines that save lives, protect public health and help people with life-threatening medical conditions live full lives. The company is divided into three main business units: CSL Behring, CSL Seqirus and CSL Vifor. Behring, acquired in 2004, manufactures and distributes blood plasma products. Seqirus was formed by a rebranding of BioCSL and the acquired Novartis flu business (bought in 2015) makes flu-related products and performs pandemic-related services for Governments. Finally, Vifor makes products for iron deficiency and nephrology (renal/kidney care). As previously mentioned, CSL’s plasma collection unit creates life-saving treatments for those will serious illnesses globally. CSL relies on plasma and blood collections to perform its primary businesses; and acquisitions are increasingly part of the CSL business. Investors often use CSL as an indirect play on rising spending on healthcare. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘fast read’ of where the WOW share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, Woolworths Group Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 3.27%, which compares to its 5-year average of 2.66%. Put simply, WOW shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield.

{"source_name": "RaskMedia", "title": "The Wesfarmers Ltd (ASX:WES) share price and Rea Group Ltd (ASX:REA) share price are worth watching", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/04/22/the-wesfarmers-ltd-asxwes-share-price-and-rea-group-ltd-asxrea-share-price-are-worth-watching-9/", "publisher_name": "Rask ASX News Team", "published_date": "April 22, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu WES share price Founded in 1914, Wesfarmers is an Australian conglomerate headquartered in Perth. It mainly has operations across Australia and New Zealand, operating in retail, chemical, fertiliser, industrial and safety products. It’s easy to think of Wesfarmers like a publicly listed private equity company. It has a long history of buying businesses, benefitting from their cash flows, re-investing in them and then selling them for a more attractive price. A good example of this might be Coles Group, which is bought in 2007 and spun out in 2018. However, by far (over 50%) of the company’s operating profit comes from Bunnings, the #1 hardware and home improvement business in Australia. It bought the remaining 52% of Bunnings that it didn’t own in 1994 for $594 million. Other brands include Kmart, Target, Officeworks, Blackwoods and Priceline Pharmacy. Wesfarmers has long been considered a leading blue chip stock for the average ASX share portfolio. Wesfarmers has quality assets such as Bunnings, Kmart and Officeworks and pays a consistent dividend to its shareholders. Since we consider Wesfarmers Ltd to be a blue chip stock, or a mature business, we like to look at things like return on invested capital (ROIC) and revenue growth as signs of sustainability. In FY23, Wesfarmers Ltd had an ROIC of 19.00% and revenue has compounded at 12.2% in recent years. Anything over 10% ROIC is pretty strong for a mature-style business, since its cost of capital is likely below that level, so Wesfarmers Ltd crosses this hurdle. REA share price Founded in 1995, REA Group is a Melbourne-based real estate advertising company that is majority owned by News Corp. In Australia, it operates through its Realestate.com.au platform. REA Group operates on a global scale and now operates property websites in around 10 countries used by some 20,000 agents. In a typical month, the core Australian website gets over 55 million visits. The business is broken down across geographic lines, with Australia taking the lion’s share of revenue. Within Australia, REA makes money by listing properties for sale or rent (i.e. the agent uses REA’s website to show properties, which the property owner is on the hook to pay). It also makes money from financial services (e.g. mortgage broking), but this is a much smaller part of the business. Property websites such as Realestate.com.au attract both buyers and sellers and aim to simplify the process resulting in an efficient and stress-free transaction. We believe its competitive advantge is that of any other established platform: network effects and efficient scale. In other words, Domain (the #2 player) is meaningfully behind REA in users and views, which means REA can continue to charge more. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘speedy read’ of where the WES share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, Wesfarmers Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 2.93%, which compares to its 5-year average of 3.84%. Put simply, WES shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield. The REA share price trades at a price-sales ratio of 16.70x, which compares to its 5-year long-term average of 12.29x. So, its shares are trading higher than their historical average. However, please do more investigating than a simple multiple like this. Our websites explain Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Dividend Discount Models (DDM), and many different ways to value a share, like Rea Group Ltd. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

It sells its concentrate through “offtake” agreements and spot sales on the Battery Material Exchange (BMX) platform. A good example of an offtake partner is Great Wall (the Chinese car company) or POSCO, a South Korean company. Pilbara has overcome significant hurdles to become a leader in lithium mining in Australia. However, as a commodities producer, its revenue is still at the mercy of (sometimes dramatic) fluctuations in the price of spodumene in the global market. Even still, bulls would say it’s a ‘pure play’ investment on demand for electric vehicles and battery tech. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘speedy read’ of where the COL share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, Coles Group Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 4.04%, which compares to its 5-year average of 3.82%. Put simply, COL shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield. The PLS share price trades at a price-sales ratio of 2.86x, which compares to its 5-year long-term average of 6.53x. So, PLS shares are trading below their historical average. However, please do more investigating than a simple multiple like this. Our websites explain Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Dividend Discount Models (DDM), and many different ways to value a share, like Pilbara Minerals Ltd. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio. Imagine earning 4%, 5% — or more — in dividend passive income from the best shares, LICs, or ETFs… it’s like magic. So how do the best investors do it?

Northern Star is one of the largest gold miners in the region. March 2024 quarterly update The business said it sold 401,000 ounces of gold sold at an all-in sustaining cost (AISC) of A$1,844 per ounce, or US$1,213 per ounce. Northern Star wanted to tell the market about three main points. Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines (KCGM) delivered “positive step-change”, driven by increased access to high-grade material. Weather impacts across Yandal masked strong milled tonnes at Jundee. Thunderbox mill remediation is “ongoing” to improve availability and consistently deliver to capacity in the long-term. Unplanned mill outages at Pogo offset a modest grade uplift. Northern Star also said its all-in cost was A$2,620 per ounce as major growth projects continue across the group, including the KCGM mill expansion. In terms of cash flow, the miner said it generated underlying free cash flow of A$143 million for the quarter, compared to A$102 million in the December quarter. Management comments The Northern Star Managing Director Stuart Tonkin said: The March quarter was challenging but also demonstrated the resilience of our teams at our three production centres. Adverse weather had a significant impact and contributed to the company revising our cost guidance for the year, though I am pleased to confirm that we remain on track to deliver our FY24 production guidance into a strong gold price environment. At KCGM, our largest and lowest cost asset, the team achieved an exceptional operational and financial performance, with the Kalgoorlie Production Centre generating the group’s highest free cash flow per ounce. Strong milling performance was achieved at Jundee while Pogo remains positioned for a stronger June quarter with throughput expected to lift. We are focused on maintaining the strong operational momentum so far seen in the June quarter, which will enable us to safely generate significant free cash flow and, in turn, superior shareholder returns. Outlook for the Northern Star share price The gold miner is guiding that for FY24 it’s expecting to sell 1,600,000 ounces to 1,750 ounces of gold at an all-in sustaining cost of A$1,810 per ounce to A$1,860 per ounce. For the June quarter, which is the last quarter of the 2024 financial year, some of the company’s focus includes Thunderbox having an annualised mill throughput rate of 5mt per year. At Pogo, the focus is improved mill throughput, reflecting improved capacity and continuity from completed projects. It’s expecting its FY24 growth capital to be between A$1.15 billion to A$1.25 billion, with an exploration budget of A$150 million. The gold price is very high at the moment, so the company can make good cash flow in the current situation. I’m not sure what the gold price is going to do next, and I don’t know if it will go through a cycle. Gold miners aren’t the sort of investment I’d make for my own portfolio. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

It is a medical equipment company that provides cloud-connectable continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machines for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). If Resmed’s name or financial reports look different it’s because Resmed’s ASX shares are CDIs and its primary listing is the NYSE. Resmed operates on a global scale, with 10,000+ employees and a presence in over 140 countries. It has two primary business units: Sleep and Respiratory Care, and Software as a Service (SaaS). Within Sleep and Respiratory Care, ResMed provides industry-leading CPAP machines for sleep apnea. Other devices are often marketed in this space but CPAP is the most effective therapy for all severities of OSA. The Respiratory Care unit covers patients ranging from those who only require therapy from CPAP systems at night to those who are dependent on non-invasive or invasive ventilation for life-support. Within the SaaS unit Resmed providers that assists durable or home medical equipment (DME/HME). Basically, it assists in out-of-hospital care. Due to Resmed’s large digital health network powered by its cloud-connected devices, Resmed can leverage its industry-leading hardware (e.g. masks and humidifiers) and its SaaS data to drive insights, improve outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs. WOW share price Founded in 1924, Woolworths is a retail operator in Australia and New Zealand with over 3,000 stores and over 100,000 employees. It is currently the Australia’s largest company in terms of revenue and market share. Woolworths’ main operations include supermarkets (under the Woolworths brand in Australia and Countdown in New Zealand), retailing through its discount department stores under the Big W brand, and business-to-business (B2B) brands like PFD. Overwhelmingly, it’s 35%+ share of Australian supermarkets is its crown jewel. Woolworths is a very popular choice for many ASX investors seeking dividend income. It consistently pays a fully franked dividend, usually at a yield of over 3%, and offers a very defensive earnings stream. It’s competitive advantage is probably best summarised as scale (distribution, low costs, etc.) and proximity (most shoppers still shop based on distance to the supermarket). Share price valuation As a growth company, the way to put a broad projection on the RMD share price could be to compare its price-to-sales multiple over time. Currently, Resmed CDI shares have a price-sales ratio of 4.30x, which compares to its 5-year average of 7.81x, meaning its shares are trading below their historical average. Please keep in mind that context is important – and this is just one valuation technique. I wouldn’t make a decision based on one metric. Since it is a more mature-style business, the WOW share price is offering a historical dividend yield of around 3.27%, which compares to its 5-year average of 2.66%. The Rask websites, especially our Rask Education platform, offer free tutorials explaining Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). Both of these models would be a better way to value the WOW share price. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

FY24 first-half result Here are some of the highlights from the first six months of the regional bank ‘s 2024 financial year: BOQ said total income was down 12% due to lower margins caused by competitive pressures and a contraction in lending. The expenses rose so much because of inflation and continued investment in ‘risk’, compliance and technology. Business as usual cost growth was only 1.2% in the half. Pleasingly, BOQ said its asset quality (meaning its loans) remains “sound” with a low loan impairment expense and “prudent provisioning”. BOQ explained the continued focus on making good returns resulted in the small reduction of its housing portfolio. The arrears and bad debts could be important for the BOQ share price over the next 12 months. Growth in the niche business banking segments, including novated leasing and lending to the health and agriculture sectors, though this was partially offset by a cautious approach to commercial real estate lending. The bank also pointed to progress on four key areas. One, it approved remedial actions plans with regulators. Second, it simplified operations with the sale of non-core asset and progress on productivity program. Third, the digital mortgage and legacy migration infrastructure has been built, with the first phase launch in the second half of 2024. Finally, there has been an organisational shift to focus on the return to equity (ROE) and improve shareholder returns. Outlook for the BOQ share price Management said the bank is optimistic on a long-term view, with the Australian economy remaining resilient and well-supported by low unemployment and strong investment. It’s expecting the loan impairment expense to remain below long-run averages. BOQ is expecting revenue and margin pressures to “moderate” in the second half of 2024, though deposit competition is expected to continue. It’s expecting home lending margin compression to stabilise and its home lending decline to moderate, with business banking growth to “increase”. Costs are expected to keep increasing due to inflation and continued investment in the business. It said it’s on track to deliver low single-digit business as usual expense growth for the second half of 2024. I wouldn’t say BOQ is an appealing investment at the moment. It’s doing the right things to try to protect profitability, but the profit is going in the wrong direction.

Hub24 provides an investment platform that offers managed portfolio solutions and “enhanced transaction and reporting functionality”. HUBconnect focuses on leveraging data and technology to provide solutions to common challenges for stockbrokers, licensees and advisers. The business also owns Class, a cloud-accounting software provider for SMSFs and trusts, along with other compliance solutions. Record third quarter for Hub24 It reported platform net inflows of $3.5 billion, an increase of 90% year on year, which included $0.8 billion from the Equity Trustees migration program. That quarter was a record for both excluding and including the migration. Excluding the large migration, the FY24 third quarter net inflows were $2.7 billion (up 47%), resulting in a record March quarter. During the quarter, 42 new distribution agreements were signed and the total number of advisers using the platform increased to 4,382 (up 17 year on year). Total funds under administration (FUA) reached $100 billion as at 31 March 2024, an increase of 30% year on year. The business noted the launch of HUB24 Discover was launched in November 2023, which has been well received with FUA of $75 million as at 31 March 2024. It also said the Hub24 platform for high-net-worth (HNW) clients was enhanced with the addition of non-custodial administration and reporting capability for directly-held client assets. What does these strong numbers mean? Hub24 said the strong March quarter is a “good indication of market sentiment and pipeline in the lead up” to the end of the financial year. The company explained strong equity markets have supported positive market movements and strong trading activity during the quarter which will benefit revenue. However, Hub24 noted the additional platform revenue margin on market movements can be lower than the total platform revenue margin due to the tiered pricing of administration fees and the impact markets can have on the percentage of FUA held as cash. Outlook for the Hub24 share price The company explained its positive outlook with the following: With record March quarter net inflows, market-leading products and solutions and a strong pipeline of opportunities from both new and existing adviser relationships we remain confident in meeting our FY25 platform FUA target of $92 billion to $100 billion and are well-positioned for future growth. Hub24 is a solid business and continues to deliver impressive growth. However, it has a high earnings valuation and I don’t know how long its growth can continue at such a high rate, so I’m cautious, even after its decline today. For me, there are better value ASX growth shares out there to look at. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

Every week millions of Australians choose to shop for essential food and drink at Coles because of its prices, range and location. While it is the smaller brother of Woolworths, which has nearly 40% market share, Coles isn’t too far behind, with about 28%. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘speedy read’ of where the SOL share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, Washington H Sl Pttnsn nd Cmpny Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 2.78%, which compares to its 5-year average of 2.54%. Put simply, SOL shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield. Since it is a more mature-style business, the COL share price is offering a historical dividend yield of around 4.12%, which compares to its 5-year average of 3.82%. The Rask websites, especially our Rask Education platform, offer free tutorials explaining Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). Both of these models would be a better way to value the COL share price. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio. Imagine earning 4%, 5% — or more — in dividend passive income from the best shares, LICs, or ETFs… it’s like magic. So how do the best investors do it?

Key point: the S&P/ASX 200 ( INDEXASX: XJO ) finished down -0.091% to 7,605.60. Markets @ Midday : Listen here at lunchtime or find all Market Matters Podcasts on Spotify . After a muted open, the market seemed to find its groove, rallying 40pts from early lows into the lunchtime peak before buying stepped away. Shares had given back almost all of the gains by 4pm at which time the UK released their monthly CPI figure which was hotter than expected, sending down for the session, right on the close. There was little diversion between sectors, particularly when you strip out Utilities which was supported by the heavyweights of the area. EVN +7.49%: the gold & copper miner hit near 2-year highs today on the back of a 3Q update that was better than feared. They produced 185koz of gold in the quarter, up 15% from 2Q where they faced a few production issues including wet weather. Evolution Mining also produced 20kt of copper, up ~30% which helped their net gold All In Sustaining Cost (AISC) number fall to $1,464/oz. Production issues have plagued the gold miners for a little while now so expectations were low heading into the update. Evolution managed to come out largely unscathed, though production guidance for the full year was pushed to the low end of the range, while costs will have to improve substantially if they are to hit forecasts. BOQ +5.17%: 1H results for the regional bank today caused a strong bounce in the share price, though the numbers still showed signs the smaller banks are struggling to compete with the Big 4. Cash earnings of $172m were around 5% ahead of consensus, driven largely by beats on bad debts, costs and the Net Interest Margin (NIM) which fell less than expected to 155bps. Home loan lending fell 1%, as did asset finance while consumer lending fell 10%. BOQ reiterated FY26 targets, however, they will have to improve volumes across these areas if they are to achieve this, flagging that additional strategies will need to be implemented given the competitive nature of the banking space at the moment. Wholesale funding costs continue to weigh on margins as well and BOQ has a significant portion of funding coming up for renewal in 2H that may weigh on earnings. The stock has been unloved for a while and remains cheap, the market may be forced to look through their issues if credit quality remains strong.

It mainly has operations across Australia and New Zealand, operating in retail, chemical, fertiliser, industrial and safety products. It’s easy to think of Wesfarmers like a publicly listed private equity company. It has a long history of buying businesses, benefitting from their cash flows, re-investing in them and then selling them for a more attractive price. A good example of this might be Coles Group, which is bought in 2007 and spun out in 2018. However, by far (over 50%) of the company’s operating profit comes from Bunnings, the #1 hardware and home improvement business in Australia. It bought the remaining 52% of Bunnings that it didn’t own in 1994 for $594 million. Other brands include Kmart, Target, Officeworks, Blackwoods and Priceline Pharmacy. Wesfarmers has long been considered a leading blue chip stock for the average ASX share portfolio. Wesfarmers has quality assets such as Bunnings, Kmart and Officeworks and pays a consistent dividend to its shareholders. REA share price Founded in 1995, REA Group is a Melbourne-based real estate advertising company that is majority owned by News Corp. In Australia, it operates through its Realestate.com.au platform. REA Group operates on a global scale and now operates property websites in around 10 countries used by some 20,000 agents. In a typical month, the core Australian website gets over 55 million visits. The business is broken down across geographic lines, with Australia taking the lion’s share of revenue. Within Australia, REA makes money by listing properties for sale or rent (i.e. the agent uses REA’s website to show properties, which the property owner is on the hook to pay). It also makes money from financial services (e.g. mortgage broking), but this is a much smaller part of the business. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘quick read’ of where the WES share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, Wesfarmers Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 2.92%, which compares to its 5-year average of 3.84%. Put simply, WES shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield. The REA share price trades at a price-sales ratio of 16.83x, which compares to its 5-year long-term average of 12.29x. So, its shares are trading higher than their historical average. However, please do more investigating than a simple multiple like this. Our websites explain Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Dividend Discount Models (DDM), and many different ways to value a share, like Rea Group Ltd. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

March 2024 quarterly update The miner reported it lost four Diavik colleagues and two airline crew members in a plane crash in January. In terms of the production, it revealed how it performed for its main commodities. The Pilbara iron ore production was 77.9mt for the first quarter of 2024, which was down 2% year on year and down 11% quarter on quarter. The performance of its iron ore division is normally a key influence on the Rio Tinto share price. Bauxite production was 13.4mt, which was up 11% year on year and down 11% quarter on quarter. Aluminium production was 826kt, this was up 5% year on year and down 2% quarter on quarter. Mined copper was 156kt, which was an increase of 7% year on year and down 3% quarter on quarter. The titanium dioxide slag production was 254kt, down 11% year on year and down 8% quarter on quarter. Rio Tinto said it delivered stable operating results in the first quarter as it navigated “seasonal challenges” across its global operations. It’s focused on growth with energy-transition commodities, with the ramp-up at (Mongolian copper mine) Oyu Tolgoi underground, the first full quarter of recycled aluminium production from Matalco and further progress at Simandou (a high grade iron ore project in African country in Guinea). The large miner said it continues to decarbonise its operations, with power purchase agreements signed, marking a “significant step towards a competitive renewable energy solution” for its Gladstone operations. Rio Tinto is also working with BHP Group Ltd ( ASX: BHP ) and BlueScope Steel Limited ( ASX: BSL ) to investigate the development of Australia’s first electric smelting furnace pilot plant, which is progressing its work on steel decarbonisation. Final thoughts on the Rio Tinto share price The business didn’t change its 2024 guidance, which includes iron production of between 323mt to 338mt and mined copper production of between 660kt to 720kt. In the last few weeks, the Rio Tinto share price has recovered close to its 52-week high, so I wouldn’t call this a cheap time to buy. The valuation doesn’t make a lot of sense to me considering the iron ore price is still below US$110 per tonne. For now, I think there are other ASX dividend shares that could make a better buy. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

On the positive side, Citigroup Inc ( NYSE: C ) fell 1.7 per cent but the company reported profit ahead of expectations on the back of strong demand for credit cards and corporate finance.

Netwealth is a financial services company that provides superannuation products, investor-directed portfolio services, managed accounts, managed funds, SMSF administration and non-custodial administration and reporting services. March 2024 quarterly update There were a lot of different growth numbers reported, so I’ll just run through those. It revealed that funds under administration (FUA) at 31 March 2024 was $84.7 billion. FUA increased $6.7 billion for the March quarter, comprising FUA net inflows of $2.7 billion and positive market movements of $4 billion. The FUA increased by 28.5% for the 12 months to 31 March 2024, with net inflows of $10.6 billion and positive market movement of $8.2 billion. It also reported a record 12-month FUA inflows of $21.2 billion. Netwealth reported FUA inflows of $5.2 billion for the March quarter, which was 40.7% higher than the prior corresponding period. Net inflows were $2.7 billion, an increase of 62.2%. Non-custodial FUA reached $281 million at 31 March 2024 and there were net inflows of $39 million for the March quarter. Funds under management (FUM) rose to $19.7 billion at 31 March 2024, an increase of $1.6 billion for the quarter. FUM net inflows for the March quarter were $0.6 billion. The managed account balance increased by $1.4 billion for the March quarter to $17 billion. Finally, the number of accounts increased by 11.6% year on year. The “strong momentum” in the March quarter saw the addition of 5,132 new accounts or 3.7% higher than the December quarter. It was also announced that Netwealth founder and major shareholder, Michael Heine, has advised that as he approaches his 75th birthday he intends to transition to a non-executive role by 30 June 2024. Netwealth share price outlook The company noted in addition to the strong account growth in the quarter, it has expanded and strengthened its new adviser and licensee relationships. Its new business pipeline including conversion rates, is very strong across all segments. It’s expecting the June quarter FUA inflows to be “very strong” with several new large transitions commencing, as well as higher seasonal flows and increased market activity. The company is exploring and implementing innovations and generative AI to “improve efficiency, productivity, client engagement and service”. It’s a great business, but the Netwealth share price has gone up more than 50% in the past year. I’m cautious about thinking this is a good time to invest at such an elevated price. There are other ASX growth shares I’d rather look at. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

Bad news continues for Dubber The bad news continued at halted tech firm Dubber Corporation Ltd ( ASX: DUB ) with the Dubber sacking it’s CEO amid an investigation that has seen travel restrictions placed after the loss of some $25 million in company cash. Dubber announced a capital raising at just 5 cents per share, with $3.1 million made via a private placement and a further $20.9 million to existing shareholders. Perseus Mining Ltd ( ASX: PRU ) fell 2.4 per cent after Silvercorp Metals Inc (NYSEAMERICAN: SVM) agreed to the groups takeover bid for the remaining 15 per cent of Orecorp Ltd ( ASX: ORR ). In positive signs, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand has kept rates on hold once again. Global markets fall on hotter than expected inflation data The Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) fell by more than 400 points, dragging the index down 1.1 per cent, as did the S&P 500 (INDEXSP: .INX) and Nasdaq Composite (INDEXNASDAQ: .IXIC), which were 1 and 0.8 per cent lower. It was bad news from the latest inflation data which showed that prices were 3.8 per cent higher than the prior year, the same rate of growth as the prior month. The news led ex Chair Larry Summers to suggest investors must consider the possibility that the next rate move would be higher. The likes of NVIDIA Corp ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) still gained 2 per cent, despite Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META) announcing they were releasing their own homegrown chips to power there expanding AI program. Shares in Costco Wholesale Corporation ( NASDAQ: COST ) were slightly higher as the company reported a 9.4 per cent increase in sales, with more significant 28 per cent growth coming from e-commerce.

{"source_name": "RaskMedia", "title": "The FAANG fallacy: A closer look at the risks of acronym investments", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/04/11/the-faang-fallacy-a-closer-look-at-the-risks-of-acronym-investments/", "publisher_name": "Patrick Poke", "published_date": "April 11, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu In recent years, the financial world has been swept up in an acronym frenzy. From the latest ‘Magnificent 7’, comprising powerhouses including Microsoft Corp ( NASDAQ: MSFT ), Apple Inc ( NASDAQ: AAPL ), Alphabet Inc Class C ( NASDAQ: GOOG ), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META), Tesla Inc ( NASDAQ: TSLA ), Amazon.com Inc ( NASDAQ: AMZN ), and NVIDIA Corp ( NASDAQ: NVDA ), to variations like FAANG [the ‘N’ represents Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX)], MAGMA , and MAMAA , these acronyms represent market darlings in moments of time. Even in Australia, we’ve had our own version with the ‘WAAAX’ – WiseTech Global Ltd ( ASX: WTC ), Altium Ltd ( ASX: ALU ), Afterpay Ltd ( ASX: APT ), Appen Ltd ( ASX: APX ), and Xero Ltd ( ASX: XRO ). But the media’s love affair with their meteoric rise can mask a hidden risk: What goes up, doesn’t always stay up. Even within these seemingly invincible acronyms, companies can falter or simply fall out of favour due to factors such as disruption, mismanagement, or poor execution. In this blog, we explore how today’s most buzzworthy investment choice can become tomorrow’s cautionary tale, and share some ETF ideas that can help investors navigate market shifts without getting burned by a single stock’s stumble or an entire acronym’s downfall. The trend trap During a rising market, when everything seems to be trending up and certain companies are taking off due to a novel idea or theme, it’s tempting to believe that this time is different. But it’s precisely during times of exuberance that the allure of quick gains can overshadow prudent investing. Lessons from the past: GE, Appen, BRIC History is littered with the wreckage of once-unstoppable companies that were idolised by many investors at the time. Consider General Electric Co ( NYSE: GE ), which fell victim to its own poorly timed acquisitions and unsustainable debt, forcing it to split. Its fall from grace as once the world’s largest conglomerate was marked by its expulsion in 2018 from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) of America’s 30 most significant businesses. Closer to home, Appen has lost nearly 99% of its value as its over-reliance on a few large clients led to its fall from grace. Appen was removed from the S&P/ASX 200 ( INDEXASX: XJO ) in 2022. It’s not just individual companies that can fall victim to overhyped trends. Remember the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China)? This catchy acronym once represented the hottest emerging markets, dazzling investors with their brief, initial outperformance (see chart below). However, the allure of the story overshadowed key risks like political instability and challenging economic fundamentals in developing nations. China’s slowdown, Brazil’s political turmoil, and the mass exodus from Russian assets due to Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine exposed the dangers of overexposure to specific emerging economies. The once-mighty BRICs have now become the “BICs,” delivering subpar returns compared to the broader global and emerging markets. Today’s trending acronyms: Magnificent 7, FAANG, MAGMA, MAMAA Facebook, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Netflix and Tesla have contributed to a significant portion of the growth in the Nasdaq-100 (INDEXNASDAQ: NDX) and S&P 500 (INDEXSP: .INX) indices over the last decade. Bundling them together into a memorable acronym and focusing on past performance makes them seem like a sound investment thesis, but going all-in on the tech behemoths can expose investors to undue risk and volatility. Just as BRIC obscured the differences in the economies in the constituent countries, FAANG and its variants can mask significant differences in the performance of individual stocks, as shown in the chart below. Although focusing on a short period of time, the performance of the FAANG companies for the last 12 months illustrates significant divergence between them, with Apple gaining just 3.2%, while Meta soared over 120%. Netflix, bumped out of the FAANG club in favour of Microsoft to form MAGMA or MAMAA, is experiencing a resurgence and outperforming Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. These unexpected outcomes illustrate that investing in one or a few of these equities exposes investors to volatility, unpredictability, and the potential to wipe out gains in dramatic twists and turns. What can we learn? While it’s true that historically, these companies have made substantial contributions to index returns, it’s equally undeniable that it’s impossible to predict when companies are past their prime. The data speaks volumes. Since 2015, nearly a third (around 180 companies) of the S&P 500 constituents have been replaced4, often due to economic shifts, disruption, poor management, or acquisitions by larger rivals. Furthermore, the tables below show how radically different the list of the world’s largest companies has become since 2000, compared to recent history. Source: Visual Capitalist, Betashares This is where considering ETFs that track entire markets and sectors, or invest in securities with defined criteria, makes sense: ETFs for a well-diversified portfolio, with growth potential Now that we’ve explored the potential pitfalls of falling for trendy acronyms, let’s delve into ETF ideas that offer both diversification and growth potential: BetaShares S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (ASX: QUS) offers investors exposure to 500 leading listed US companies, including the Magnificent 7 stocks, with equal weighting across all holdings, rebalanced quarterly. This means that each stock within the portfolio receives an equal investment allocation, whether it’s a tech giant like Microsoft or NVIDIA, or a consumer goods company like Lululemon or Procter & Gamble. As a result of this equal weighting approach, QUS provides a diversified portfolio of US stocks while avoiding over-reliance on a few narrative-dominating companies or the technology sector. Rather than investing in companies based on size, Betashares Australian Quality ETF (ASX: AQLT) screens for Australian stocks based on ‘quality’ metrics of high return on equity, low leverage, and relative earnings stability. As at 3 March 2024, its top holdings include BHP Group Ltd ( ASX: BHP ), CSL Ltd ( ASX: CSL ) and Commonwealth Bank of Australia ( ASX: CBA ). As a result, investors gain access to a portfolio of quality Australian companies, offering potential portfolio diversification benefits. Some growth investors aim to identify and access tomorrow’s potential FAANG and MAGMA equivalents, without shouldering the individual stock risk or the complexities of pinpointing which small company might evolve into the next NVIDIA. Nasdaq Next Gen 100 ETF (ASX: JNDQ) aims to track the Nasdaq Next Generation 100 Index (before fees and expenses), comprising companies in the relatively early stages of their development that have the potential to emerge as future leaders across various sectors, including technology, industrials and healthcare. While the focus of the technology narrative often centres on the American-centric Magnificent 7, it’s crucial to recognise the significant role played by Asian firms such as chipmakers Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KRX: 005930) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturng Co Ltd (TPE: 2330), in shaping the global AI landscape. Betashares Asia Technology Tigers ETF (ASX: ASIA) offers investors exposure to this vital backbone by investing in the region’s 50 largest technology and online retails stocks. As such, this ETF can serve as a compelling complement to US technology stocks, providing a well-rounded approach that includes exposure to AI, digital commerce and consulting services. Conclusion By embracing index investing through ETFs, you can gain exposure to narrative-dominating securities like ‘FAANG’ and ‘WAAAX’ within the context of a well-diversified portfolio. This means you can enjoy the benefits of these market leaders without the stress of individual stock risk. Moreover, should an acronym lose its appeal, a large company encounters mismanagement, or economic changes spark new innovations, indexes will automatically rebalance. This ensures that your portfolio stays aligned with the evolving market landscape, as new market leaders are added, and underperforming companies are removed. 2024 ETF Playbook: Coming in to land Download our special report to see the economic and market outlook from our Chief Economist, 12 ETF ideas for the year ahead, and 6 charts you can’t ignore in 2024.

{"source_name": "RaskMedia", "title": "What landing?", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/04/11/what-landing-david-bassanese-betashares/", "publisher_name": "David Bassanese", "published_date": "April 11, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu Global markets – week in review It was largely a case of good news is bad news again on Wall Street last week, with a series of stronger-than-expected activity reports pushing back rate cut expectations further – pushing up bond yields and pushing down equity prices in the process. Equity prices have withstood the moderate rebound in bond yields so far this year, but with valuations stretched – both in outright PE and relative equity-risk price premium terms – they could be nearing a breaking point where a deeper correction develops. Also not helping is the rebound in oil prices on simmering Middle East tensions, with new risks that Iran could be dragged into a conflict with Israel. The highlights last week were stronger-than-expected reports on US manufacturing, job openings and the March payrolls report. The US ISM manufacturing report pushed above 50, suggesting the sector is finally recovering from its post-COVID slump. Job openings failed to decline as expected and remain at a relatively high 8.8m. And there was a much stronger-than-expected 303k gain in employment during March (market 200k), allowing the unemployment rate to drop back to 3.8% from 3.9%. The saving grace in Friday’s payrolls report – and which likely stemmed a potential further equity decline – was the 0.3% gain in average hourly earnings (in line with market expectations), which saw annual wage growth ease further to 4.1% from 4.3%. Israel’s strike in Syria, which killed a top Iranian military commander, has created new tensions, with oil prices lifting 4.5% last week, to be up 21% year to date. The upshot of all this is that the US market now anticipates only two Fed rate cuts later this year – compared to the six expected at the start of the year. US 10-year bond yields lifted 0.2% to 4.4% last week, compared to a low of 3.88% around Christmas. Also steadying markets to a degree, however, is ongoing commentary from the Federal Reserve (including from Powell himself) that rate cuts are still, at this stage, likely this year – although there is no hurry. The week ahead Against this backdrop, this week’s March reading on consumer (CPI) and producer (PPI) prices will no doubt be key – any major upward surprise could finally be the straw that breaks the back of the unrelenting equity market rally, at least for a time. For what it’s worth, the market expects the monthly gain in the core CPI to ease back to 0.3% from 0.4% in February, allowing annual core inflation to ease to 3.7% from 3.8%. Monthly growth in the PPI is also expected to ease back to 0.2% from 0.3%. The other highlight this week will be the start of the Q1 earnings reporting season , with a few major financials [ JPMorgan Chase & Co ( NYSE: JPM ), BlackRock Inc ( NYSE: BLK ) and Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C)] kicking off the beauty parade on Friday. As reflective of a strong economy, the earnings season is likely to be upbeat – but whether that’s enough to offset pressure from delayed Fed rate cut hopes remains to be seen. Global equity trends Looking at global equity trends, the rebound in bond yields is helping drag back the relative performance of growth over value, as evident in the pullback in Nasdaq-100 (INDEXNASDAQ: NDX) relative performance. Japan and Europe are also faring better, while Australia and emerging markets less so. Australian markets With little local news to digest, the S&P/ASX 200 ( INDEXASX: XJO ) pulled back 1.6% last week in line with global trends -while bond yields edged higher. The $A held firm despite a further 8% slump in iron-ore prices to below $US 100/tonne. The only point of interest in the minutes from the latest RBA policy meeting was the decision not to formally contemplate a rate hike among policy options – further confirming the Bank’s gradual shift to a more neutral policy bias. In other data, national house prices kept rising (is that news?), while ANZ Group Holdings Ltd ( ASX: ANZ ) job ads pulled back a little further – the latter consistent with a glacial slowing in labour market strength. Local highlights this week will be an update on the state of consumer and business confidence with the Westpac Banking Corp ( ASX: WBC )/Melbourne Institute and National Australia Bank Ltd ( ASX: NAB ) surveys, respectively. Although there have been tentative signs of recovery of late, household confidence remains in a slump. Business confidence has been more upbeat due to strength in most other areas of the economy away from consumer spending.

{"source_name": "RaskMedia", "title": "Looking for an ASX blue chip share? Try the Coles Group Ltd (ASX:COL) share price", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/04/14/looking-for-an-asx-blue-chip-share-try-the-coles-group-ltd-asxcol-share-price-8/", "publisher_name": "Rask ASX News Team", "published_date": "April 14, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu COL share price Coles is an Australian retailer providing customers with everyday products including fresh food, groceries, general merchandise, liquor, fuel and financial services. It was founded in 1914 in Victoria, where its HQ still remain. Coles was formerly owned by conglomerate Wesfarmers from 2007 until 2018, when it was spun-off and listed as a separate entity on the ASX under the ticker symbol ‘COL’. Coles’ earnings are dominated by the supermarkets side of the business, however, it partly or fully owns or operates adjacent businesses like flybuys, Liquorland, First Choice, Vintage Cellars, Coles Express and more. Every week millions of Australians choose to shop for essential food and drink at Coles because of its prices, range and location. While it is the smaller brother of Woolworths, which has nearly 40% market share, Coles isn’t too far behind, with about 28%. PLS share price Pilbara Minerals is a leading ASX-listed lithium company, owning 100% of the world’s largest, independent hard-rock lithium operation, Pilgangoora, which it acquired in 2014. Pilbara’s primary business is to, put simply, find, dig up and sell spodumene concentrate. It sells its concentrate through “offtake” agreements and spot sales on the Battery Material Exchange (BMX) platform. A good example of an offtake partner is Great Wall (the Chinese car company) or POSCO, a South Korean company. Pilbara has overcome significant hurdles to become a leader in lithium mining in Australia. However, as a commodities producer, its revenue is still at the mercy of (sometimes dramatic) fluctuations in the price of spodumene in the global market. Even still, bulls would say it’s a ‘pure play’ investment on demand for electric vehicles and battery tech. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘speedy read’ of where the COL share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, Coles Group Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 4.09%, which compares to its 5-year average of 3.82%. Put simply, COL shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield. The PLS share price trades at a price-sales ratio of 3.00x, which compares to its 5-year long-term average of 6.53x. So, PLS shares are trading below their historical average. However, please do more investigating than a simple multiple like this. Our websites explain Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Dividend Discount Models (DDM), and many different ways to value a share, like Pilbara Minerals Ltd. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio. Imagine earning 4%, 5% — or more — in dividend passive income from the best shares, LICs, or ETFs… it’s like magic. So how do the best investors do it? Chief Investment Officer Owen Rask has just released his brand new passive income report . Owen has outlined 10 of his favourite ETFs and shares to watch, his rules for passive income investing, why he would buy ETFs before LICs and more.

What can we learn from its success and how do we identify the next Altium? In mid-2023, on the RASK Australian Investors Podcast , Owen & Luke discussed the factors that predict multi-bagger investments and our approach to unearthing them here at Seneca , and a few ideas that look set to be long term compounders in the Seneca Australian Small Companies Fund . The market is often poor at identifying structurally supported growth over the long-run. Short-cut valuation metrics like price-earnings (PE) and price-earnings-growth ratios (PEG) are static and fail to accurately capture the most important factor in investing – rates of change. Take Altium for example, which traded on a PE of 25x 10 years ago, and just got taken over at an 88x valuation multiple! However, the commonly associated tech companies like WiseTech Global Ltd ( ASX: WTC ) and Xero Ltd ( ASX: XRO ) who already trade on PE ratios of 92x and 88x respectively, are priced for the known growth rates to continue for many years into the future – we want to look for the companies that have the potential to be the next ALU, or the next WTC or XRO, and can benefit from multiple expansion as well as rapid earnings growth, that isn’t yet priced by the market. RPMGlobal Holdings Ltd The mining industry is relatively slow to adopt new software and technology. High risk work, coupled with high value equipment and stringent regulatory oversight bring about a reluctance to shake the apple cart. RPMGlobal Holdings Ltd ( ASX: RUL ) has built and acquired range of software products includes mine planning, mobile equipment management, finance management and more. RPMGlobal’s AMT software has established itself as the go-to for major mining companies and its operations and planning product XECUTE is gaining traction with small/medium-sized miners. Investors appear to have overlooked the multi-year transition underway at RPM.  Like other multi-baggers before it [Altium, Adobe Inc ( NASDAQ: ADBE ), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Xero spring to mind], RPM is moving from an upfront, one-off revenue model to an ongoing subscription-based revenue model. Like Adobe in 2012, the rapid rate of underlying revenue growth has been obscured by this transition. Critically for savvy investors, Adobe has hit the inflection point – where incremental revenue growth drops down to the bottom line thanks to flattening development costs. The mining software and advisory player reported 1H24 revenue up +20.6% to $56.2 million, and EBITDA up +89% to $10.0 million. RPMGlobal expenses its development costs (unlike many of its ASX-listed software peers that capitalise them), meaning the majority of that $10m EBITDA drops down to the bottom line, with $6.8 million profit after tax. Management reaffirmed guidance for $21.5m – $23.5m EBITDA in FY24. RPM trades on circa 4x EV/Sales on a forward-looking basis, and 10.8x EV/EBITDA (on a pre-R&D basis so that we can compare apples with apples). ASX information technology peers trade on 39x EV/EBITDA currently, up from a long-term average of 31x. Through a combination of continued high margin earnings growth and multiple re-rate, we think RUL should generate outsized long term returns for shareholders and has the potential to be the next multi-bagger on the ASX. If it doesn’t, don’t be surprised to see RPM get a takeover bid, considering its valuation compares very favourably to the 50x EV/EBITDA multiple represented by the Altium takeover bid, and to the ~27x average that comparable mining software peers (Micromine, Deswik) have transacted at. Webjet Ltd When people think of Webjet Ltd ( ASX: WEB ) they probably think of the old flight comparison website that helps prospective travellers shop around for cheap flight deals to holiday destinations. Over time Webjet’s business model has shifted from a B2C online travel agent to a B2B global marketplace for the hotel industry. WebBeds is the second largest and fastest growing ‘bed bank’ in the world. It now generates the majority of Webjet’s earnings, and is the primary engine of growth, posting $89.9 million of EBITDA in 1H24 and growing by 41% year over year. This compares to the webjet.com.au division which made $26.6 million EBITDA and grew by 24%. WEB is now a truly global marketplace business. As a holiday accommodation (hotels) aggregator, WebBeds enjoys similar hyper-scalable characteristics as some of its offshore technology peers like Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ: ABNB) on 23x EV/EBITDA or Booking Holdings Inc ( NASDAQ: BKNG ) on 16x. WebBeds, like other similar businesses, operates on EBITDA margins in the 50-55% range. We think WEB is mispriced on 13x forecast EV/EBITDA, in line with its 10-year average despite being a materially higher-quality business now. Investors are still pricing WEB like it’s a low-moat travel agent, rather than a higher quality aggregator. We see no reason why in time, this high quality marketplace won’t be priced in line with other businesses that operate on similar high margins, high ROIC% and benefit from a sustainable flywheel effect. If WEB can re-rate from a two year forward P/E of ~17x towards that of a REA Group Ltd ( ASX: REA ) on 38x or even a Domain Holdings Australia Ltd ( ASX: DHG ) on 27x, there is substantial upside for WEB shares. On this basis, we can comfortably get to a WEB valuation implying >30% upside over the medium term. And as we’ve learned from companies like Altium, high-quality companies often deliver positive earnings surprises that in hindsight, have made forecasts look overly conservative. We recently increased our WEB position in our Seneca Australian Shares SMA , which has outperformed the S&P/ASX 200 ( INDEXASX: XJO ) Accumulation Index since inception. 3 ASX dividend stocks in 2024 (I recommend to everyone) I’ve just released a special free report to Rask readers covering the 3 top ASX dividend stocks I recommend to EVERY INVESTOR in 2024.

The business is building data centres , the infrastructure platform for the digital economy, delivering the “critical power, security and connectivity for global cloud computing providers, enterprise and government. It says it has a strong focus on sustainability and operational excellence through renewable energy sources and delivering “world-class operational efficiency”. Nextdc capital raising The company has announced it’s raising $1.321 billion with a fully underwritten 1 for 6 pro-rata accelerated non-renounceable entitlement offer for new Nextdc shares. Nextdc is going to use the money to accelerate the development and fit-out in the core markets of Sydney and Melbourne to meet “unprecedented growth in customer demand and position itself to take advantage of ongoing market expansion over the medium-term.” The company reminded investors that for the 12 months to 31 December 2023, Nextdc’s contracted utilisation increased 64.8MW, or 77%, to 149MW. It said it has a record forward order book of 68.8MW, which the company thinks will convert into billings across FY25 to FY29, which will drive future growth in revenue and profit. It’s going to spend $400 million on accelerating the built capacity of the data centre S3, $350 million in developing the S4 data centre, $300 million in the development of the S5 data centre, $330 million on accelerating the built capacity of M2 and $500 million on identified land acquisition opportunities in Asia Pacific which are at various stages of evaluation. Raising details The new shares are going to priced at A$15.40, which represents an approximate 8% discount to yesterday’s closing Nextdc share price. Eligible shareholders will be able to subscribe for 1 new share for every six shares held at 7pm on Monday 15 April 2024. FY24 guidance reaffirmed Nextdc reaffirmed for FY24 it’s expecting total revenue to be in the range of $400 million to $415 million. Underlying EBITDA is expected to come between $190 million to $200 million. Management commentary The Nextdc CEO and Managing Director Craig Scroggie said: NEXTDC continues to see significant growth in demand for its data centre services underpinned by powerful structural tailwinds. Amid this backdrop, we have decided to bring forward the development and fitout of key assets in Sydney and Melbourne to ensure we are able to meet this growth in demand, continue to support our customers, and ensure the Company is well positioned to take advantage of the diverse range of opportunities expected to present over the medium term. Final thoughts on the Nextdc share price The company is doing the right things to tap into the huge demand, I’m just not sure what a good price is for the business. It’s an advanced piece of real estate, but I don’t know how easy it will be for other data centre operators to challenge Nextdc and reduce future returns if there’s a larger supply of more data centres. With the Nextdc share price up 50% in a year, it’s the right time for the company to raise capital, but I’d be uncertain about buying shares at this high price.

{"source_name": "RaskMedia", "title": "CSL Ltd stock and Resmed CDI (ASX:RMD) shares are 2 ASX shares to watch", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/04/10/csl-ltd-stock-and-resmed-cdi-asxrmd-shares-are-2-asx-shares-to-watch-7/", "publisher_name": "Rask ASX News Team", "published_date": "April 10, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu CSL share price CSL is a global biotechnology company that develops and delivers innovative medicines that save lives, protect public health and help people with life-threatening medical conditions live full lives. The company is divided into three main business units: CSL Behring, CSL Seqirus and CSL Vifor. Behring, acquired in 2004, manufactures and distributes blood plasma products. Seqirus was formed by a rebranding of BioCSL and the acquired Novartis flu business (bought in 2015) makes flu-related products and performs pandemic-related services for Governments. Finally, Vifor makes products for iron deficiency and nephrology (renal/kidney care). As previously mentioned, CSL’s plasma collection unit creates life-saving treatments for those will serious illnesses globally. CSL relies on plasma and blood collections to perform its primary businesses; and acquisitions are increasingly part of the CSL business. Investors often use CSL as an indirect play on rising spending on healthcare. RMD share price Resmed was founded in 1989 by Peter Farrell in Australia but is now based in San Diego, California. It is a medical equipment company that provides cloud-connectable continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machines for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). If Resmed’s name or financial reports look different it’s because Resmed’s ASX shares are CDIs and its primary listing is the NYSE. Resmed operates on a global scale, with 10,000+ employees and a presence in over 140 countries. It has two primary business units: Sleep and Respiratory Care, and Software as a Service (SaaS). Within Sleep and Respiratory Care, ResMed provides industry-leading CPAP machines for sleep apnea. Other devices are often marketed in this space but CPAP is the most effective therapy for all severities of OSA. The Respiratory Care unit covers patients ranging from those who only require therapy from CPAP systems at night to those who are dependent on non-invasive or invasive ventilation for life-support. Within the SaaS unit Resmed providers that assists durable or home medical equipment (DME/HME). Basically, it assists in out-of-hospital care. Due to Resmed’s large digital health network powered by its cloud-connected devices, Resmed can leverage its industry-leading hardware (e.g. masks and humidifiers) and its SaaS data to drive insights, improve outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘fast read’ of where the CSL share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, CSL Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 1.28%, which compares to its 5-year average of 1.24%. Put simply, CSL shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield. The RMD share price trades at a price-sales ratio of 4.51x, which compares to its 5-year long-term average of 7.81x. So, RMD shares are trading below their historical average. However, please do more investigating than a simple multiple like this. Our websites explain Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Dividend Discount Models (DDM), and many different ways to value a share, like Resmed CDI. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

Once again it was strength in the iron ore price, as the world awaits more stimulus in China, which sent it towards US$110, and boosted the likes of Rio Tinto Ltd ( ASX: RIO ) by 3 per cent. Utilities also gained, boosted by AGL Energy Limited ( ASX: AGL ) which was 2.7 per cent higher, while property sold off by 1 per cent on another threat to valuations. Shares in blood plasma maker and treatment provider CSL Ltd ( ASX: CSL ) were unmoved despite suggestions by Macquarie that the share price could reach $500 in the future. Glove maker Ansell Ltd ( ASX: ANN ) was the top of the large caps, gaining 6.5 per cent on news the company had completed a $400 million raising at $22.45 per share to fund the purchase of Kimberly-Clark Corp ( NYSE: KMB ) PPE business. Commodity miners rally, on silver, lithium price It was good news for the broader mining sector as copper and silver producers were supported by the strongest prices in close to a year. The likes of South32 ( ASX: S32 ) added 1.6 per cent while lithium miner Liontown Resources Ltd ( ASX: LTR ) gained close to 9 per cent. Ricegrowers (Sunrice) gained 1.9 per cent after the NSW confirmed it would extend an export license agreement, while shares in Santos Ltd ( ASX: STO ) sunk by 2 per cent. Santos continues to struggle with a planned PNG LNG project, costing as much as $15 billion, still awaiting a final investment decision. The build cost is being seen as ‘uneconomic’ following a number of contractor quotes. On the positive side, business conditions and confidence were unchanged in March, with positive signs in the retail and construction sector offsetting weakness elsewhere. Markets stagnate ahead of inflation data Both the S&P 500 (INDEXSP: .INX) and Nasdaq Composite (INDEXNASDAQ: .IXIC) managed small gains on Tuesday, up 0.1 and 0.3 per cent respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) fell by less than 0.1 per cent. It markets three straight winning days for the tech-focused benchmark and was boosted by Alphabet Inc Class A ( NASDAQ: GOOGL ) reaching a new record high. The Alphabet announced it would be making its AI-powered processing chip to cloud customers in the coming months as it seeks to get an edge on Amazon.com Inc ( NASDAQ: AMZN ); shares gained 1.1 per cent. Markets are awaiting another important inflation print on Wednesday morning which will drive sentiment ahead of earnings season. Shares in Boeing Co ( NYSE: BA ) fell 1.9 per cent after Boeing reported its lowest level of deliveries since mid-2021 as its slow turnaround continues.

It was founded in 1914 in Victoria, where its HQ still remain. Coles was formerly owned by conglomerate Wesfarmers from 2007 until 2018, when it was spun-off and listed as a separate entity on the ASX under the ticker symbol ‘COL’. Coles’ earnings are dominated by the supermarkets side of the business, however, it partly or fully owns or operates adjacent businesses like flybuys, Liquorland, First Choice, Vintage Cellars, Coles Express and more. Every week millions of Australians choose to shop for essential food and drink at Coles because of its prices, range and location. While it is the smaller brother of Woolworths, which has nearly 40% market share, Coles isn’t too far behind, with about 28%. PLS share price Pilbara Minerals is a leading ASX-listed lithium company, owning 100% of the world’s largest, independent hard-rock lithium operation, Pilgangoora, which it acquired in 2014. Pilbara’s primary business is to, put simply, find, dig up and sell spodumene concentrate. It sells its concentrate through “offtake” agreements and spot sales on the Battery Material Exchange (BMX) platform. A good example of an offtake partner is Great Wall (the Chinese car company) or POSCO, a South Korean company. Pilbara has overcome significant hurdles to become a leader in lithium mining in Australia. However, as a commodities producer, its revenue is still at the mercy of (sometimes dramatic) fluctuations in the price of spodumene in the global market. Even still, bulls would say it’s a ‘pure play’ investment on demand for electric vehicles and battery tech. Share price valuation One way to have a ‘quick read’ of where the COL share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, Coles Group Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 4.08%, which compares to its 5-year average of 3.82%.

Within Australia, REA makes money by listing properties for sale or rent (i.e. the agent uses REA’s website to show properties, which the property owner is on the hook to pay). It also makes money from financial services (e.g. mortgage broking), but this is a much smaller part of the business. Property websites such as Realestate.com.au attract both buyers and sellers and aim to simplify the process resulting in an efficient and stress-free transaction. We believe its competitive advantge is that of any other established platform: network effects and efficient scale. In other words, Domain (the #2 player) is meaningfully behind REA in users and views, which means REA can continue to charge more. While it may be large, Rea Group Ltd is a growth stock, and so it requires a different set of rules and may not be straightforward hard to value, at times. Studies have shown that over 5-10+ years, it’s top-line revenue growth which explains a stock’s performance. That’s why it’s good to see Rea Group Ltd is able to growth revenue at 16.4%, a strong clip. BHP share price BHP Group (formerly BHP Billiton) is a diversified natural resources company producing commodities that was founded in 1885. BHP’s principal business lines are mineral exploration and production. BHP’s assets, operations and interests are separated into three focus areas: Copper and related minerals (e.g. gold, uranium, silver, zinc, etc.), Iron Ore, and Coal (i.e. metallurgical and energy). BHP shares are often seen as a reliable dividend paying investment and is a common constituent of an ASX share portfolio. If you own an popular ETF or LIC, or invest with Industry Super, chances are you have exposure. Share price valuation As a growth company, the way to put a general prediction on the REA share price could be to compare its price-to-sales multiple over time. Currently, Rea Group Ltd shares have a price-sales ratio of 17.28x, which compares to its 5-year average of 12.29x, meaning its shares are trading higher than their historical average. Please keep in mind that context is important – and this is just one valuation technique. I wouldn’t make a decision based on one metric. Since it is a more mature-style business, the BHP share price is offering a historical dividend yield of around 5.78%, which compares to its 5-year average of 9.38%. The Rask websites, especially our Rask Education platform, offer free tutorials explaining Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). Both of these models would be a better way to value the BHP share price. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio. Imagine earning 4%, 5% — or more — in dividend passive income from the best shares, LICs, or ETFs… it’s like magic. So how do the best investors do it?

This company has two divisions, defence (weapon) systems and space systems . For example, its space technologies segment specialises in optical sensors and effectors to detect, track and characterise objects in space. Debt repaid The business revealed it had completed a debt repayment of $20.5 million on schedule. This repayment follows the $26.9 million in September 2023 under a separate 12-month working capital facility. This means the ASX share has now repaid, on schedule, half of the principal amounts originally due to Washington H. Soul Pattinson and Co. Ltd ( ASX: SOL ) and 100% of the working capital facility amounts, with the only outstanding amount relating to a term loan facility. Improving the balance sheet is good news for the EOS share price. Remaining debt The remaining term loan with Washington H. Soul Pattinson is $35 million, which had a term of 36 months (three years), with a maturity of 11 October 2025, with a total rate of 26%, needing a total repayment of $52.1 million. The $52.1 million repayment for the term loan facility includes the principal amount, establishment fees and interest accrued to date. In addition to the above repayment due in October 2025, EOS is required to pay interest each month, totalling approximately $19 million over the remaining term of the debt. The borrowing facility agreements include a 100% ‘make whole’ clause which applies in the case of any early repayment. Recent solid growth The business recently reported its result for the 12 months to December 2023 which showed an increase in revenue from continuing operations of 59% to $219.3 million, with strong growth by segments. At 31 December 2023, the company had a backlog of contracted future work of over $600 million, including $181 million of conditional contracts. EOS said it continues to pursue a number of material opportunities in different markets, including Europe, the Middle East and other international markets. The EOS share price is up 190% in the last year, but it’s down more than 80% from January 2020. With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.

Try the Pilbara Minerals Ltd (ASX:PLS) share price", "title_link": "https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2024/04/11/looking-for-an-asx-growth-share-try-the-pilbara-minerals-ltd-asxpls-share-price-8/", "publisher_name": "Rask ASX News Team", "published_date": "April 11, 2024", "Description": "Site menu Menu PLS share price Pilbara Minerals is a leading ASX-listed lithium company, owning 100% of the world’s largest, independent hard-rock lithium operation, Pilgangoora, which it acquired in 2014. Pilbara’s primary business is to, put simply, find, dig up and sell spodumene concentrate. It sells its concentrate through “offtake” agreements and spot sales on the Battery Material Exchange (BMX) platform. A good example of an offtake partner is Great Wall (the Chinese car company) or POSCO, a South Korean company. Pilbara has overcome significant hurdles to become a leader in lithium mining in Australia. However, as a commodities producer, its revenue is still at the mercy of (sometimes dramatic) fluctuations in the price of spodumene in the global market. Even still, bulls would say it’s a ‘pure play’ investment on demand for electric vehicles and battery tech. SOL share price Founded in 1903, Washington H. Soul Pattinson (WHSP) is an investment company with a diversified portfolio of assets across a range of industries and asset classes. Some of SOL’s largest holdings include stakes in other well-known publicly listed companies such as TPG Telecom ( ASX: TPG ), New Hope Group ( ASX: NHC ) and a cross shareholding in Brickworks ( ASX: BKW ). SOL’s mission is to deliver superior returns to its shareholders by creating capital growth and steadily increasing dividends as a holding company. It’s the second-oldest publicly listed company on the ASX and has a strong track record of capital growth and dividends. It should be thought of as family-run LIC, for the benefit of all shareholders (who are deeply aligned). Share price valuation As a growth company, the way to put a rough calculation on the PLS share price could be to compare its price-to-sales multiple over time. Currently, Pilbara Minerals Ltd shares have a price-sales ratio of 2.90x, which compares to its 5-year average of 6.53x, meaning its shares are trading below their historical average. Please keep in mind that context is important – and this is just one valuation technique. I wouldn’t make a decision based on one metric. Since it is a more mature-style business, the SOL share price is offering a historical dividend yield of around 2.69%, which compares to its 5-year average of 2.54%.

NAB recently saw its boss, Ross McEwan, step down and be replaced by Andrew Irvine. Mr Irvine has been quick to make appointments with NAB’s leadership team. NAB’s new leadership team At the end of April, Rachel Slade will be appointed as the ASX bank share ’s new group executive of business and private banking – she’s currently the group executive of personal banking. Ana Marinkovic is going to be appointed the group executive of personal banking – she is currently the executive of business direct and small business in the business and private banking team. Cathryn Carver has been appointed the group executive of corporate and institutional banking. The new NAB CEO, Andrew Irvine, said he was delighted with all of the appointments and pointed out they were from within NAB’s senior leadership team, “helping ensure alignment in delivering for the bank’s customers and colleagues.” Irvine also said all three executives had a track record of helping customers succeed “while getting the basics of banking right”. Management commentary NAB CEO Irvine said: Rachel, Ana and Cath, who will lead NAB’s customer-facing businesses in Australia, are great relationship bankers who inspire their teams to deliver results for customers. They understand the importance of using technology and data to make NAB easier and simpler to bank with. This completes the executive leadership team that will take NAB forward and maintain the momentum we have across the business by executing with discipline and focus. We see plenty of opportunities to build on NAB’s leadership in areas such as business lending, particularly to small and medium businesses, while continuing to deliver better outcomes for customers and colleagues. My thoughts on the NAB share price The NAB share price has climbed 19% in six months even though arrears are rising and the net interest margin (NIM) is being challenged because of competition in the sector. The NIM tells us the loan interest rate compared to the cost of funding the loans (eg savings accounts) I like NAB in the banking sector, but the higher NAB share price means it’s now trading at a high valuation considering the economic conditions. I’d wait for a better price, or choose different ASX dividend shares . With interest rates UP, now could be one of the best times to start earning passive income from a portfolio.
