LNG Energy Group Let&CloseCurlyQuote;s start with LNG Energy Group , market capitalization C$46.53 million, an acquirer and developer of natural gas production and exploration assets in Latin America with over 50 per cent insider ownership. The company, active in Colombia and Venezuela , holds over 800,000 acres of land for development and exploration in close proximity to markets and pipelines allowing for rapid monetization of new production. It was producing 19 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day (bcfe/d) and sitting on 98 bcfe of proven and probable reserves valued at US$306 million as of March 2024 , and boasts a management team whose extensive M&A and capital markets experience in oil and gas, including at Bank of America and British Petroleum, sets it up for future expansion across Latin America. If LNG Energy&CloseCurlyQuote;s robust turn to profitability, posting net income of US$18.47 million in Q3 2023 after years of losses, is any indication, it&CloseCurlyQuote;s that the company is now capable of putting up solid results in the midst of active growth, as detailed in its year-end 2023 results . LNG Energy Group stock (TSXV:LNGE) last traded at C$0.30 per share. The stock has given back 31.82 per cent year-over-year, but only 6.25 per cent since inception in September 2023. Ur-Energy Ur-Energy , market capitalization C$691.39 million, is a uranium mining company that has produced and packaged approximately 2.8 million pounds of U 3 O 8 from its Lost Creek in-situ recovery facility in Wyoming since 2013, with an estimated 12.7 million pounds eU 3 O 8 measured and indicated and 6.1 million pounds eU 3 O 8 inferred remaining to be exploited over a 13-year mine life. The company is also building Shirley Basin , its second in situ recovery facility in Wyoming, which will be able to produce up to 1 million pounds of U 3 O 8 per year and is expected to recover 6.4 million pounds of an estimated 8.8 million pounds eU 3 O 8 measured and indicated. Construction is estimated to finalize in 2025 with operating costs estimated at US$24.40 per pound. With uranium prices up by about 5x over the past five years to US$93.50 per pound, Ur-Energy&CloseCurlyQuote;s long-tenured management team, de-risked by working lifetimes in mining and uranium, benefits from a runway extending from 2024 well into the next decade to continue creating shareholder value. Ur-Energy stock (TSX:URE) last traded at C$2.44 per share. The stock has added 83.46 per cent year-over-year and 119.82 per cent since 2019. Pampa Metals Our final small-cap stock pick to bolster the commodity sleeve of your portfolio is Pampa Metals , market capitalization C$17.53 million, a copper-gold explorer developing the Piuquenes copper-gold porphyry project in Argentina, on which it holds an option to acquire an 80 per cent interest. The junior miner has backed up historical intercepts from the 1990s, including 558.2 m grading 0.38 per cent copper, 0.42 g/t gold and 2.4 g/t silver, with 422 m at 1 per cent copper equivalent (CuEq), including 132 m at 1.45 per cent CuEq in March 2024 , and 448 m grading 0.42 per cent copper and 0.46 g/t gold, including 126 m at 0.66 per cent copper and 0.74 g/t gold in May 2024 . Piuquenes&CloseCurlyQuote; highly mineralized porphyry system remains open to depth and to the northeast, with results pending for Pampa&CloseCurlyQuote;s third drill hole. Management – ex Rio Tinto, BHP, Goldman Sachs, UBS – believes Piuquenes could be a company-maker, seeing the potential for a cluster of deposits across the property, with a second undrilled outcropping porphyry identified at Piuquenes East and numerous other nearby targets still to be explored. When we consider copper&CloseCurlyQuote;s current nearly 40-year high at US$4.61 per pound – including a massive 28 per cent gain since Feb. 2024 – the metal&CloseCurlyQuote;s essential role in the energy transition thanks to its unmatched electrical conductivity, and Pampa stock&CloseCurlyQuote;s approximately 60 per cent gain since optioning Piuquenes in November 2023, it seems plain as day that the market is warming up to the copper stock&CloseCurlyQuote;s long-term value proposition. Pampa Metals stock (CSE:PM) last traded at C$0.26 per share and is down by 53.64 per cent over the past five years, positioning it for a significant re-rating upon positive results should copper hold or shoot higher.

{"source_name": "Stockhouse Canada", "title": "How a small-cap tech stock is broadening MRI technology", "title_link": "https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2024/05/06/how-small-cap-tech-stock-broadening-mri-technology", "author": "Jocelyn Aspa", "Description": "Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology is most commonly associated with the healthcare industry – and is used to create detailed images of the organs and tissues in the body – companies such as Nanalysis Scientific (TSXV:NSCI) are broadening the horizons of MRI capabilities. With its headquarters in Calgary, Nanalysis is a company that develops and manufactures compact MRI and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) devices for clinical, laboratory and industrial markets. Of particular note, these portable devices do not need liquid helium or other cryogens and can be used across different industries such as medical, pharma, biotech, mining and oil and gas as well as government and university research labs around the world. In an interview with The Market Online, Nanalysis Scientific CEO Sean Krakiwsky explained the company has broadened the scope of its products and services to reach a wide range of markets, and he added that the pharmaceutical market remains its largest industry vertical. In other words, Nanalysis Scientific presents itself as a distinct play that services a variety of sectors, giving investors exposure to industries they might not otherwise have. As the company continues to ramp up its efforts, The Market Onlinetakes a closer look at Nanalysis and its product offerings, what it has in store for the future, and what makes it a sound investment opportunity. A dive into Nanalysis Established in 2009, Nanalysis Scientific&CloseCurlyQuote;s business model is what it calls, “MRI and NMR for industry,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; as the company develops and manufactures portable NMR spectrometers or analyzers for laboratory and industrial markets. In a nutshell, thanks to its technology, Nanalysis can help analysts identify and understand items that are integral for industrial and commercial purposes. This includes being able to detect if something is branded correctly, such as whether extra virgin olive oil is authentic or if it&CloseCurlyQuote;s an inferior imitation product that has been diluted with soy oil. The company&CloseCurlyQuote;s technology can also determine whether fish supplements have problematic components or if pills taken off the streets are illegal narcotics that have been modified. “&NegativeMediumSpace;&NegativeMediumSpace;Big Pharma, food [companies] petrochemicals, advanced materials, [and] a lot of universities use our portable MRI machines to determine exactly what molecules are in a substance of interest, such as a new drug being designed by companies like Pfizer or Eli Lilly,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Krakiwsky told The Market Online . “The portable magnetic resonance machines can also detect how much THC is in cannabis oil, or how much lithium is in a lithium brine pool.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; All of this is to say that Nanalysis Scientific&CloseCurlyQuote;s technology is shaping the way pharmaceutical companies develop drugs and helping industrial chemists determine whether a chemical reaction is legitimate. Notably, the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s flagship products are the 60 megahertz and 100-megahertz portable magnetic resonance machines, of which Krakiwsky said Nanalysis has sold more than 1,200. The 60 MHz Benchtop product is the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s flagship all-in-one compact benchtop magnetic resonance spectrometer, which can be transported anywhere and makes hands-on access easy. The platform comes with an easy-to-use interface controlled by a touchscreen, keyboard and mouse, or external computer with data that can be acquired easily by the user. Source: Nanalysis Scientific Meanwhile, the 100 MHz product improves productivity with rapid and accurate results. The product is also the top high-field NMR console on the market and allows its users to access more information with better peak dispersion and resolution. Source: Nanalysis Scientific From a geographical perspective, Krakiwsky explained that Nanalysis&CloseCurlyQuote; most important market is currently the United States, which is where the company has its largest presence. Nanalysis also sells directly in certain parts of Europe and has plans to expand its direct sales presence into other international markets such as Japan, India and even Indonesia where it currently sells via a network of local dealers. The Nanalysis competitive advantage Krakiwsky told The Market Online that the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s core technology platform is where the company really shines. Case in point, what sets these products apart, unlike most other MRI machines, is the size. If you&CloseCurlyQuote;ve ever had an MRI scan done, you know that most MRI machines require a large, dedicated room. Nanalysis machines are only a fraction of the size and are portable. Despite their smaller sizes, however, the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s machines are powerhouses in their own right. Because of this, the machines are easily marketable to universities, labs and smaller-scale companies. “[Nanalysis&CloseCurlyQuote; advantage] is that [it] has been the most successful at miniaturizing this technology,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Krakiwsky told The Market Online , adding that only one or two other companies have been able to scale down the size of the technology. “Nobody else in the world has been able to succeed the way we have.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Krakiwsky explained that all the technology the company has developed is patent-protected, and Nanalysis Scientific also does all its proprietary manufacturing to protect its intellectual property. As of February, the company has more than 10 patents granted and/or pending in the United States. Patents protect innovations in the field of technology and give the owner exclusive rights to its property so others cannot make, use, offer for sale, sell or import into the United States the invention claimed. Q4 and full year 2023 financial results In late April, the company revealed its Q4 and full year 2023 financial results. During Q4 2023, Nanalysis Scientific showed continued revenue growth quarter-over-quarter fueled in part by the expansion of the Airport Security Project. “Our security services segment completed taking over all basic services on the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s Airport Security Project early in 2024, and this project will continue its expansion and roll-out, building towards full revenue run rate through the year. Additionally, in 2023 we had significant up-front training costs which contracted our margins. In 2024, we expect that to be significantly reduced and look for security services margins to improve throughout the year,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Krakiwsky said in a statement. The company also achieved a new quarterly revenue record of $9.8 million driven in part by the continued expansion of security services related to Nanalysis&CloseCurlyQuote; airport maintenance project. Nanalysis also completed in January the phase-in period related to its airport security maintenance project resulting in its security services business performing maintenance of passenger screening imaging and detection equipment across all of Canada and beginning a scale up phase to increase revenue to its expected run rate. The future for Nanalysis Scientific As Nanalysis looks to potentially expand into other markets, investors can watch for several catalysts and milestones as 2024 carries on and eventually moves into 2025. Krakiwsky said investors can expect partnership announcements from the company as well as ones related to regulatory changes for how its main flagship products will drive pharmaceutical companies into adopting this new technology. “[There will also be] continued growth on [the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s] services side of our business,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; he said. The most important thing in 2024, however, will be Nanalysis Scientific achieving profitability, which has not always been the case for the company. The management team Sean Krakiwsky, CEO Krakiwsky is the founder of Nanalysis Scientific, which is his third tech startup in a 20-year period. Over the course of those two decades, he raised more than $75 million in equity funding. Krakiwsky previously founded and built Acceleware (TSXV:AXE), a company that provides software solutions to harness the parallel processing capabilities of multi-core GPUs/CPUs for the electronic design and oil and gas industries. Krakiwsky has Master of Science and Bachelor of Science degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Calgary. He was drafted by the NHL&CloseCurlyQuote;s Los Angeles Kings in 1986 and played in their farm system for two years before going back to school in 1990. Randall McRae, CFO In addition to being an entrepreneur, Randall McRae has more than 15 years of experience with public and private companies and professional service firms. In 2007, McRae received his Bachelor of Commerce degree in accounting from the University of Calgary and received his chartered accountant designation in 2010. McRae later completed the CPA Canada in-depth taxation program and was recognized as one of the top nine students nationally in his class. Prior to his role with Nanalysis Scientific, McRae was a senior manager in a large accounting firm. He also previously co-founded a technology-focused professional services firm and held a senior role in a publicly traded oilfield services company. Julien Muller, CTO Julien Muller has more than 16 years of experience in the NMR/MRI technology market. After obtaining a diploma in electronic and system engineering from INSA Strasbourg, he started with RS2D in 2004, studying and designing RS2D&CloseCurlyQuote;s first NMR spectrometer solution. From there, Muller designed a custom MRI product using a superconducting cryogen-free magnet and high-field NMR console. In 2018, Muller released the fourth generation of NMR/MRI spectrometer, providing the latest FPGA technology to the whole magnetic resonance product profile. The investment corner At the time of this writing, Nanalysis Scientific Corp. has a market cap of C$50.27 million and 111.72 million shares outstanding. Year-to-date, shares of the company are up 9.76 per cent to $0.45 as of market close on April 23. Trading on the TSX Venture Exchange, Nanalysis is a small-cap tech company with technology that will transform the pharmaceutical and industrial industries, among others. With a number of milestones to look forward to this year as Nanalysis gears up to lock down partnerships and expand its presence, the company might just be the right fit for your investment portfolio.

An intuitive way to find misunderstood penny stocks is by screening for profitable companies year-over-year, whose share prices have nevertheless fallen to a meaningful degree. Using The Globe and Mail&CloseCurlyQuote;s stock screener , I set parameters for price-to-earnings from 0.1 to 10, market capitalization of C$1 billion and under, and 52-week stock performance beginning from -90 per cent, and generated a list of 166 companies that managed to generate cash amid a tanking share price. While many of these names have fallen for valid reasons, a choice few have not, in line with Mr. Market ‘s storied manic-depressive tendencies. Here are three penny stocks from the list that I found to be trading for cheap: Inventronics Inventronics (TSXV:IVX) designs and manufactures enclosures for numerous industries, including telecommunications, electric distribution and energy. Based in Manitoba and active since the 1970s, the industrial stock is a classic example of a company whose boring business allows it to fly under the radar. As a leading name in metal boxes and cabinets for utility infrastructure, which may house anything from traffic control technology to fiber optic cables and trash or recycling, the company is well established across the world as a high-quality producer and long-term partner. (Source: Inventronics) Inventronics&CloseCurlyQuote; reputation has earned it the ability to turn a consistent profit, posting positive net income over the past five years with a high of C$2.09 million in 2022, though shareholders have not been nearly as kind, pummelling the stock with a more than 75 per cent loss year-over-year, last trading at C$0.74 per share. Supported by considerable brand power, a focus on essential services, and the ability to self-fund growth initiatives, this company keeping your neighbourhood electrical box safe from the elements is clearly being overlooked by the broader market. Spartan Delta Spartan Delta (TSX:SDE) , our next cheap penny stock to put on your radar, is an Alberta-based oil and gas production and development company creating shareholder value through free funds flow, which we can define as cash, minus dividends, capital and decommissioning costs. (Source: Spartan Delta) The company&CloseCurlyQuote;s portfolio is composed of its Deep Basin asset, which is expected to produce about 39,100 barrels of oil per day (boe/d) in 2024, and its Duvernay asset, which is expected to produce about 400 boe/d this year, across a total land package spanning more than 300,000 hectares. Since inception in 2019, Spartan has managed to generate an astounding C$1.578 billion in adjusted funds flow, a 584 per cent return on cumulative capital employed, as well as return more than C$1.8 billion in capital to shareholders , accounting for C$10.45 per share as of February 2024, demonstrating management&CloseCurlyQuote;s ability to deliver value despite the COVID pandemic severely dampening demand. On the balance sheet, this translates to positive net income over the past four years, including C$47.66 million in 2020, C$334.22 million in 2021, C$681.09 million in 2022 and C$663.11 million in 2023, with proven and probable reserves of more than 250 million boe still remaining for the company to continue lining shareholder pockets. Though the stock has given back 71.93 per cent year-over-year, reflecting the C$1.7 billion sale of Spartan&CloseCurlyQuote;s Montney asset to Crescent Point Energy , the last 24 per cent of that drop – which occurred after post-sale 2023 guidance – feels unwarranted because the company has remained profitable to the tune of C$120 million in combined net income in the two quarters since. Additionally, Spartan Delta expects production to fall from 53,179 boe/d in 2023 to guidance of 38,500 to 40,500 boe/d in 2024 driven by a focus on Deep Basin optimization and exploration at Duvernay. The negative optics of the steep drop in stock price, though largely warranted, and reduced production, though aligned with long-term growth, are likely keeping most investors at bay, despite the proven efficiency of the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s operations and its ability to self-fund a path towards more value-accretive acquisitions or organic growth. The stage is clear for value hunters to assess and potentially capitalize. Sucro Our final cheap penny stock pick is Sucro (TSXV:SUG) , established in 2014, a growth-oriented sugar company active in South America, North America, Mexico and the Caribbean that serves 10 of the top 20 largest global food companies (as of December 2023), and boasts an estimated 18-25 per cent share of the U.S. organic sugar market. Sucro&CloseCurlyQuote;s chief executive officer, Jonathan Taylor, shows off vacuum pans for boiling sugar syrups on their journey towards crystallization. (Source: Sucro Ltd.) The company&CloseCurlyQuote;s refineries in Hamilton, Ontario, and Lackawanna, New York, benefit from a low cost of between US$160,000 to US$210,000 per thousand metric tonnes, and can accommodate about 340,000 metric tonnes in combined capacity per year, with a planned 1 million metric tonne expansion through an additional facility in Ontario planned for 2025. Guided by 77 per cent insider ownership (68 per cent attributable to the CEO), management has efficiently delivered on Sucro&CloseCurlyQuote;s growth ambitions across numerous metrics from 2021 to 2023, as highlighted by: An EBITDA compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 50 per cent from 2021-2023 Net income of US$18.41 million in 2021, US$37.72 million in 2022 and US$16.80 million in 2023 Revenue growth of 83 per cent from US$270.19 million in 2021 to US$496.83 million in 2023 Refinery volume growth of 275 per cent from 40,000 to 150,000 metric tonnes per year, with a jump to 250,000 tonnes expected in 2024 Sucro is forecasting material growth in refinery production volumes over the next few years as it expands its sourcing, refining and distribution infrastructure, supported by self-generated cash and an ongoing 15-year U.S. sugar market tailwind ( slide 6 ), positioning investors to harvest long-term upside by building a position today. Perplexingly, despite Sucro&CloseCurlyQuote;s value-creation track record, shares have tanked by 38.1 per cent since listing on the TSXV in October 2023, last trading at C$6.50 per share, just C$1.50 above the accepted C$5 penny stock threshold. Parting proviso Before you invest in one of these cheap penny stocks, or others that catch your fancy from the screener, make sure to run them through your personal due diligence process to ensure they align with your financial goals, risk tolerance and current financial situation. While recent profitability and a discounted stock price make for an enticing green flag towards a prospective investment, the combination alone isn&CloseCurlyQuote;t sufficient to merit your money.

An essential stock to consider is Fobi AI (TSXV:FOBI) , market capitalization C$16.53 million, a specialist in compiling and deriving real-time insights from customer data. Fobi AI&CloseCurlyQuote;s stock is down by 80.26 per cent year-over-year despite having helped to optimize decision-making at some of the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s largest businesses across retail & consumer packaged goods, insurance, sports & entertainment and casino gaming. To gain a foothold in the US$9 trillion digital wallet market , Fobi released Wallet Pass , a platform that delivers personalized digital in-wallet experiences for every need, including membership perks, ticketing, coupons and venue management, while collecting and segmenting customer data by demographics, preferences and purchase behaviour to sharpen strategies towards increased engagement and profitability. Fobi has issued more than 100 million wallet passes to date, and is in discussions for numerous deals under non-disclosure agreements, as per episode 75 of the Fobi Insider podcast. To stake its claim in the US$5 trillion global AI market , the company created the Fobi Data Exchange , a plug-and-play omnichannel platform that uses AI to generate real-time analytics from customer data to hone in on and better satisfy their needs. Fobi&CloseCurlyQuote;s ability to aggregate 100 per cent of every transaction, increase engagement by up to 88 per cent, and delineate expansion strategies optimized for return on investment, has led the company to build a reputation for being able to get to the heart of what customers want , scale recurring device, usage and software-as-a-service revenue on a path to profitability, and work with industry leaders such as the Nasdaq stock exchange, Amazon Web Services, Square, Lightspeed, NCAA, Comcast, Telus, NTT Data, PGA and MGM Resorts, to name just a few. It&CloseCurlyQuote;s Fobi&CloseCurlyQuote;s results-oriented reputation that has allowed it to expand its high-profile partner list with a pair of brewers – Asahi and Vancouver Island Brewing – both key players in their target markets in the more than US$670 billion global beer industry , and both with eyes on a greater competitive edge to maintain beer&CloseCurlyQuote;s leadership position against rival categories such as wine, ready-to-drink and non-alcoholic beverages. Asahi and Fobi AI In early April, Fobi signed on to deliver Asahi Canada a customized and fully automated analytics dashboard , offering real-time performance data and forecasting capabilities for the predominantly independent and fragmented Western Canadian liquor market. Founded in 1899, Asahi is a global food and beverage company behind five of the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s most beloved beers: Asahi Super Dry, Grolsch, Kozel, Peroni Nastro Azzurro and Pilsner Urquell. The company is Japan&CloseCurlyQuote;s largest brewer, generating total revenue of US$19.1 billion in 2023. Fobi&CloseCurlyQuote;s data consolidation and segmentation by consumer, store, city, region and pricing index, will holistically capture the Western Canadian competitive landscape, highlight market gaps, and drive Asahi&CloseCurlyQuote;s growth and profitability in the region through actionable insights, solving a significant pain point for the conglomerate. Asahi will be able to create customer portfolios that reflect demographics, purchase history and spending patterns, positioning itself to identify emerging trends before the herd, expand visibility and conversion, and build upon its more than one century of leadership in the food and beverage industry. Vancouver Island Brewing and Fobi AI Just last week, Fobi followed up the Asahi contract with a second deal with Vancouver Island Brewing, one of Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s original craft brewers, less than one year after the companies&CloseCurlyQuote; collaboration on a digital loyalty program in August 2023. The new deal will see the iconic British Columbia-based manufacturer receive a custom data analytics dashboard of its own to drive exponential growth. Vancouver Island Brewing , which has been locally producing playful and accessible beers since 1984, will benefit from automated and real-time market visibility at the industry, city and retail store levels, enhancing its ability to identify consumer patterns, forecast trends and strengthen relationships with its private retail partners, while more efficiently allocating resources towards fortifying its dominant position in the B.C. craft beer market. Fobi is in discussions with numerous other manufacturers to expand their consumer data collection capabilities, unlock new avenues for monetization, and strengthen recurring revenue for the ultimate benefit of its shareholders. The company managed to grow top-line revenue by 12.6 times from C$160,000 in 2021 to C$2.02 million in 2023, and is on track for a record figure in 2024, as it focuses on creating value in its multi-trillion-dollar addressable market. A wealth of unrecognized value By granting perspective to companies used to blind decision making, and simplifying the digital wallet experience to ride the tailwind of digital economic growth , Fobi represents a turnkey solution to future-proofing operations in any industry. According to the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s investor deck , this value proposition grants it an initial global market opportunity estimated to reach more than US$30 trillion through 2030. Fobi&CloseCurlyQuote;s demonstrated value-add exposes its stock&CloseCurlyQuote;s 80.26 per cent drop year-over-year to be the overreaction market-tested investors dream of, one where excessive volatility, likely because of high interest rates, ensuing risk-off sentiment, and the difficulty of evaluating unprofitable companies, has created an attractive entry point for allocators who recognize the high level of conviction the company deserves. As Fobi minimizes expenses and maximizes margins with each new deal that it closes from its growing pipeline, as most recently evidenced by a data licensing agreement with B.C.&CloseCurlyQuote;s Red Truck Beer Company , and word-of-mouth about its tools to leverage the benefits of AI continues to travel, it is not a matter of if but when the broader market prices in the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s extraordinary potential.

Indiva Ltd. (TSXV:NDVA) recently reported its fiscal year 2023 results, showcasing a solid performance across its operations. With record positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and income from operations, the edible cannabis producer continues to solidify its position in the ever-evolving cannabis industry. Background Established in 2015 with headquarters in London, Ontario, Indiva has emerged as a prominent player in the cannabis market, specializing in the production of high-quality products including edibles, capsules and pre-rolls. Financial highlights These fiscal year 2023 results paint a picture of success for Indiva. One of the standout figures is the gross revenue for Q4 2023, totalling a record C$12.6 million. This represents an impressive15.5 per cent sequential increase from the previous quarter and a substantial 21.9 per cent increase year-over-year from Q4 2022. Such robust growth underscores the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s ability to capture market share and capitalize on evolving consumer preferences. Management&CloseCurlyQuote;s take In a news release on these results , Indiva&CloseCurlyQuote;s president and chief executive, Niel Marotta, explained the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s net income came in just shy of break-even in Q4, which is a testament to the popularity of its products, low-cost production platform and its focus on cost control. “Our core brands, namely Pearls by Grön, No Future, Bhang Chocolate and Indiva Blips continue to gain market share in Canada, as Indiva continues to hold the No. 1 market share position in edibles nationally,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Marotta said. “More importantly, our revenue mix continues to shift towards brands and products that were developed in-house at Indiva, demonstrating that Indiva&CloseCurlyQuote;s core competency goes beyond leading the industry as the low-cost producer of edibles, but also as a best-in-class innovator of beloved edible products. Thirty-five per cent of net revenue in Q4 2023 was derived from brands created and owned by Indiva, including Indiva 1432 chocolate, Indiva Blips, Indiva Doppio Sandwich Cookies, and No Future gummies and vapes, up from 20 per cent of net revenue in Q1 2023. “Further, Indiva achieved 27 new SKU listings in 2023, and has already received 10 additional SKU listings in 2024. 24 of the 27 new SKU introductions in 2023 and nine of 10 new SKUs accepted for listing thus far in 2024 are from in-house innovation and owned brands. We still strongly believe that an increase in allowable THC per pack of edibles would improve public safety, and while we were very disappointed in the results and recommendations from the ( Cannabis Act ) legislative review published late March, Indiva remains committed to product innovation that will support both industry and edible category growth. Our enthusiasm to continue to delight of-age cannabis enthusiasts in Canada is unwavering, and we have a robust pipeline of new products which will hit market in the second quarter and in the second half of 2024.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; The government&CloseCurlyQuote;s final report of the legislative review of the Cannabis Act recommends that Health Canada keeps the 10 milligrams per package limit and establishes a definition of higher-potency products and apply additional warnings. Marotta said he thinks a very compelling argument can be made for increasing those limits, commercially and from a public safety point of view. The belief is that a higher limit would drive fewer people to the illicit market for those higher doses and competitive prices, which would only foster more growth in the legal edible market. Outlook to the horizon Looking ahead, Indiva anticipates that its Q1 results may experience a sequential decline compared with the record-setting Q4 performance. However, the overall outlook for 2024 remains robust, fuelled by strategic initiatives, expanding distribution channels, and a growing consumer base. As regulatory landscapes evolve and consumer preferences continue to shift, Indiva is well-positioned to navigate challenges and seize opportunities in the dynamic cannabis market. In an exclusive interview with The Market Online&CloseCurlyQuote;s “Watchlist&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; with Coreena Robertson, Marotta said the team is also focusing on innovating and developing products that are owned and developed in-house. “In Q4 2023, about 35 per cent of our revenue was from our own products,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; he explained. “In 2024, we think that number will be as high as 45 per cent.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Click the video below to watch the full interview. The edible cannabis market&CloseCurlyQuote;s value The edible cannabis market that Indiva is serving stands to see substantial gains. According to Statista , Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s whole cannabis market is expected to experience significant growth in the coming years. Projections indicate that this market&CloseCurlyQuote;s revenue is set to reach US$5.63 billion this year. An annual growth rate of 3.17 per cent over the next five years is expected, which will result in a market volume of C$8.98 billion by 2029. Narrowing in on the edibles market, the research team at Headset Insights , owners of the largest cannabis market dataset in the world, reported that edible sales had reached C$180 million by the end of 2021 and reached a quarter billion dollars in sales by the end of 2022. Dried cannabis accounted for 71 per cent of total value of legal, non-medical retail sales in 2021 and 2022. Solid edibles was second, at 4.1 per cent, according to Statistics Canada . (Source: Statistics Canada.) Market leadership Indiva&CloseCurlyQuote;s achievements extend beyond financial performance. The company maintains its position as the national market share leader in the edibles category, a testament to its expertise in crafting delectable and innovative cannabis-infused products. Indiva also ranks No. 2 nationally in unit share across all cannabis categories, showcasing its broad appeal and competitive edge in the market. Why invest in Indiva? For investors seeking exposure to the burgeoning cannabis industry, Indiva Ltd. presents an attractive investment opportunity. With a proven track record of financial success, market leadership in key categories, and a promising outlook for future growth, Indiva offers investors the potential for substantial returns. However, as with any investment, thorough due diligence is crucial. Prospective investors are encouraged to delve deeper into the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s financials, growth strategies, and competitive positioning before making investment decisions. Boasting a solid financial performance, market leadership, and promising future prospects, Indiva Ltd. is in a prime position to deliver value for investors in the years to come.

An undercovered name that fits this thesis on every count is Pinnacle Silver and Gold (TSXV:PINN) , market capitalization C$0.87 million, whose stock has given back 60 per cent year-over year, and 96.83 per cent since 2019, despite owning and advancing two Ontario-based gold exploration projects with demonstrated district-scale potential. Let&CloseCurlyQuote;s explore the projects in more detail to better understand how investors are positioned for an exponential stock price re-rating. The Argosy Gold Mine Project Pinnacle&CloseCurlyQuote;s 100-per-cent-owned Argosy Gold Mine Project is host to the most significant past-producing gold mine in the Birch-Uchi Belt, which yielded 101,875 ounces of gold and a minor amount of silver between 1931 and 1952 from 276,573 tonnes of ore averaging 12.7 g/t Au. Birch-Uchi is three times larger than the nearby Red Lake Belt and is thought to house similar geology, but it is comparatively underexplored because of being accessible only by air or winter road. The 604-hectare property, subject to a 2.5 per cent net smelter royalty, is only 2.5 km south of the iron formation-hosted Richardson Lake Occurrence, and just 10 km northwest of First Mining Gold&CloseCurlyQuote;s (TSX:FF) Springpole Deposit , the largest in Birch-Uchi, with 4.6 million ounces of gold and 24.3 million ounces of silver indicated, and 0.3 million ounces of gold and 1.4 million ounces of silver inferred, all of which support the robustness of Argosy&CloseCurlyQuote;s quartz-vein-hosted gold mineralization. Illustration of the Argosy Gold Mine Project&CloseCurlyQuote;s depth potential. Source: Pinnacle Silver and Gold. Management has identified significant depth potential on the property, with historical development reaching a depth of only 270 m, and a previous operator uncovering high-grade gold mineralization below the old mine workings up to 400 m deep, yielding historical results of 11.75 g/t Au over 1.55 m (No. 2 Vein), 14.67 g/t Au over 1.7 m (No. 3 Vein), 10.95 g/t Au over 2.63 m (No. 11 Vein), and 14.15 g/t Au over 1.65 m (P Vein), supporting the search for resources on parallel, unexplored veins. Next steps include a LiDAR survey, mapping and sampling programs, and a summer 2024 drill program to further demonstrate the continuity of Argosy&CloseCurlyQuote;s gold mineralization at depth. The North Birch Gold Project Only 300 metres away from Argosy, Pinnacle&CloseCurlyQuote;s 100-per-cent-owned North Birch Gold Project spans 3,850 hectares in the Birch-Uchi Belt, with both projects only 110 km northeast ofRed Lake, Ontario, which boasts a rich mining history going back more than a century. The property covers a geological setting, supported by airborne magnetic, induced polarization and LiDAR surveys, which management interprets as highly prospective for iron formation-hosted and high-grade quartz vein-hosted gold mineralization, offering several strong drill targets for follow-up. The North Birch Gold Project. Source: Pinnacle Silver and Gold. North Birch houses a folded and sheared iron formation (IF) similar to the one hosting Newmont&CloseCurlyQuote;s 7-million-ounce Musselwhite Mine , only 190 km to the northeast. Historic exploration south of the IF yielded a drill hole with up to 35 g/t Au over 1.6 m, as well as a grab sample at 5.64 g/t Au from pyritic iron formation at nearby H Lake, substantiating iron formations&CloseCurlyQuote; well-documented role as strong physical and chemical traps for gold all over the world. Management also believes the stratigraphy underlying most of North Birch may be similar to the Balmer Assemblage, host to the 20-million-ounce Campbell/Red Lake gold orebody (past production and reserves) in the adjacent Red Lake Belt. Just 12 km to the southeast, First Mining&CloseCurlyQuote;s Springpole enhances North Birch&CloseCurlyQuote;s prospectivity even further, as the former boasts a 2021 pre-feasibility study estimating a post-tax net present value (5%) of US$995 million, a post-tax internal rate of return of 29%, and average production of over 300,000 ounces of gold per year. Pinnacle&CloseCurlyQuote;s initial diamond drilling program in February-March 2022 explored the southeastern part of an 8-km-long target horizon. Drill hole NB22001 intersected a deformation zone more than 100 m wide within the IF, as interpreted from geophysics and LiDAR, yielding gold and copper assays up to 0.25 g/t Au and 363 ppm copper (Cu). Intercepting highly sheared IF up to a vertical depth of 320 m, the drill hole demonstrates the presence of quartz-carbonate alteration and pyrite-pyrrhotite mineralization, common indicators of gold mineralization that warrant follow-up drilling. Drill hole NB22002, for its part, tested coincident magnetic and induced polarization anomalies 800 m along stratigraphic strike to the northwest, discovering a zone of strong biotite alteration with geochemistry indicative of strong hydrothermal activity separate from the IF and deformation zone. Pinnacle is planning to map, sample and drill additional IF targets at North Birch this summer with a high probability of uncovering additional mineralization, given its gold-rich neighbours and known mineralization at Argosy. Management to hang your conviction on The path to delineating the full extent of North Birch and Argosy&CloseCurlyQuote;s exploration upside is paved by a team of mining veterans , each of them well-versed in the ins-and-outs of pinpointing economically extractable metals and minerals. Pinnacle&CloseCurlyQuote;s President, Director and CEO, Robert Archer, is a professional geologist with more than 40 years of mining industry experience throughout the Americas, including 15 years cutting his teeth at major mining companies. As Co-Founder of Great Panther Mining, a mid-tier precious metals producer, he served as President and CEO from 2004-2017 and as Director until 2020. Archer joined Pinnacle as a Director in March 2018, and was appointed CEO in January 2019 and President in October 2021. Archer&CloseCurlyQuote;s established leadership is complemented by: David Cross, Pinnacle&CloseCurlyQuote;s Chief Financial Officer, who brings more than 21 years of experience in junior mining finance and corporate governance. Colin Jones, Independent Director, and his almost 40 years of experience as a mining, exploration and consulting geologist on all continents. David Salari, Independent Director, whose more than 35 years in mining and mineral processing include global experience in the design, construction and operation of extractive metallurgical plants. Ron Schmitz, Independent Director, who has served as a director and/or chief financial officer for various public and private companies since 1997 and is currently Principal and President of ASI Accounting Services, which has provided administrative, accounting and office services to public and private companies since 1995. It&CloseCurlyQuote;s Pinnacle&CloseCurlyQuote;s complete package, composed of prospective properties, a hot target commodity, a stock price at a near total loss, and a management team that knows how to transform value in the ground to value in shareholders&CloseCurlyQuote; pockets, that makes its ongoing private placement an opportune one. A capital raise geared towards shareholder value creation The junior gold stock is offering exposure to its free-lunch of a value proposition through a non-brokered private placement of up to C$600,000. It will issue up to 20 million units composed of one common share and one half of one share purchase warrant, with each warrant convertible into an additional share priced at C$0.05 for 24 months from issuance. Net proceeds will go towards summer 2024 drilling preparations at Argosy and North Birch, as well as new project evaluations and general working capital, granting the company added flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions and harvest leverage from gold continuing to test all-time highs , with top economist David Rosenberg seeing a reasonable path to US$3,000 per ounce for the precious metal. Exponential upside at a peak-fear valuation As should be evident by now, an investment in Pinnacle Silver and Gold today is squarely aligned with the multi-bagger returns for which junior mining stocks are revered. The junior gold stock, left for dead by prevailing macroeconomic forces – including generationally high interest rates disincentivizing risk – is a clear example of market inefficiency, positioning long-term investors to benefit alongside a 23 per cent contingent of smart-money shareholders (5 per cent institutional and 18 per cent insiders), as the field team breaks ground on summer exploration and actively pursues other district-scale opportunities in the Americas. It&CloseCurlyQuote;s not often that investors come across an opportunity with maximal reversion potential, but when they do, as with Pinnacle, it should immediately travel to the top of their due diligence lists.

{"source_name": "Stockhouse Canada", "title": "How to interpret movements in the price of gold", "title_link": "https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2024/05/02/how-to-interpret-movements-price-gold", "author": " Trevor Abes ", "Description": "With gold up by around 100 per cent since 2019, signaling strong demand for its value preservation properties, it&CloseCurlyQuote;s an opportune time for a refresher on what movements in the gold price tell us about macroeconomic conditions, and how these conditions might affect our current and future investments. You can buy yourself an ounce of gold for US$2,309, plus the 3-5 per cent in expenses your provider tacks on for their services, as of 8:57 am ET on Wednesday, which is the highest it has ever cost since it became a freely traded asset in 1971. While this means that every past gold buyer is presently in the black, this hasn&CloseCurlyQuote;t always been the case, given the shiny yellow metal&CloseCurlyQuote;s volatile history. How to use the gold price to become a better investor 1a. Looking to history, study the influencing factors behind gold&CloseCurlyQuote;s upward price momentum The current gold price is a sweet deal for investors who picked up ounces in the US$1,200s in 2019, after more than a decade of double-digit returns from the S&P 500 , and the general public&CloseCurlyQuote;s confidence in equities at a notable high, both of which made non-yielding assets such as gold seem unappealing. Then came 2020, and with it the COVID-19 pandemic , causing countries to screech their economies to a halt, as the global population waited out the development of a vaccine from the comfort of their homes. Governments were forced to print more money to aid all the citizens and businesses no longer able to go about their daily to-dos, and in so doing, devalued their currencies at record rates , with 21 per cent of all U.S. dollars printed in 2020 alone. The dwindling dollar made hard assets, such as gold and real estate, look incredibly attractive in comparison, sending gold from about US$1,400 when the pandemic hit the stock market in March 2020, to an all-time high of more than US$2,000 only six months later. Uncertainty about high inflation and rising interest rates has since pushed the gold price past US$2,300, with a reasonable path to US$3,000 tied to imminent rate cuts lowering yields on competing assets such as bonds and savings accounts, increased militarization around the world, and high U.S. debt dampening the dollar&CloseCurlyQuote;s status as a reserve currency, all of which are stoking the metal&CloseCurlyQuote;s millennia of history as a store of value. 1b. Identify attractive areas for investment when gold is up, based on the market&CloseCurlyQuote;s attitude towards value preservation Gold rising to all-time-highs signals that risk-on sentiment, especially in the riskiest parts of the stock market, is likely at a pronounced low, resulting in pockets of undervaluation worth a deeper look. We can put this thesis into practice by screening for small-cap and micro-cap stocks at 52-week lows to find quality operations that have been unjustly punished, despite their growth, profitability, or innovative research. Readers should pay particular attention to gold mining stocks, which have a history of tracking the gold price, but have failed to do so over the past few years, with Sprott , Mining.com , Kitco and The Globe and Mail identifying generational risk-reward potential in the space. Readers can also dive into recent and relevant Stockhouse content, including Three mining stocks that look cheap with gold at all-time highs , Three of the best small-cap value stocks to buy in 2024 , and Three innovative stocks for the cutting edge of your portfolio . 2a. Looking to history, study the factors behind gold&CloseCurlyQuote;s downward price momentum As the world emerged from the Global Financial Crisis at the start of the 2010s, and investors recovered from more than 45 per cent drops in the TSX and the S&P 500, savvy allocators put capital to work at depressed valuations. This began what would become a more than 10-year bull market for stocks – from 2009 until the COVID-19 pandemic – marked by low interest rates and a rise in globalization spurring on business investment. The global stock market would go on to average more than 20 per cent annual returns during the period, causing gold and its value-preservation qualities to be kicked to the curb. The gold price proceeded to drop from its previous all-time high of about US$1,900 per ounce in 2011 to about US$1,150 in 2019, as an increasing number of market participants followed the herd, putting their faith in stocks continuing their stellar performance. 2b. Identify attractive areas for investment when gold is down, based on the market&CloseCurlyQuote;s attitude towards value preservation When the price of gold is dropping, risk-on sentiment is probably on the rise, supported by a strong economy with robust demand and easily accessible capital, making it easier for companies to pursue growth and create shareholder value. Under this thesis, investors are more willing to suffer larger short-term losses for a chance at significant gains, and might even dip their toes into speculative assets with little to no record of operational performance. To align ourselves with high-probability opportunities when gold is down, we can isolate the frothiest parts of the market for potential short sales , setting ourselves up to flip investors&CloseCurlyQuote; blind faith in companies likely to fail into a tidy profit. Alternatively, we can screen for stocks trading at a discount to their past performance, in direct contrast to broader market fervor. Try setting price-to-earnings from 0.1 to 10, market capitalization to C$1 billion and under, and 52-week stock performance beginning from -90 per cent, for a list of companies with tanking stocks despite profitable operations.

As consumers shift towards online shopping and businesses adapt to omnichannel retailing, POS systems have emerged as the backbone of transactions, inventory management and customer relationship management. For investors eyeing opportunities in this burgeoning sector, understanding the dynamics of POS and identifying key players is essential. The digital commerce economy and market size The digital commerce economy has witnessed exponential growth over the past decade, fuelled by factors such as increasing internet penetration, smartphone usage and shifting consumer preferences. According to Statista, global retail e-commerce sales amounted to US$4.28 trillion in 2020 and are projected to reach US$6.39 trillion this year.

{"source_name": "Stockhouse Canada", "title": "Four of the Magnificent Seven dropped today: Here's why", "title_link": "https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2024/04/25/four-magnificent-seven-dropped-today-here-s-why", "author": " Trevor Abes ", "Description": "The Magnificent Seven – Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Facebook owner Meta Platforms – generated nearly two-thirds of the S&P 500&CloseCurlyQuote;s returns in 2023 and account for more than 25 per cent of the index. As a key driver of U.S. market returns, investors who stay on top of the group&CloseCurlyQuote;s recent developments may glean insights into consumer demand, investor sentiment, as well as burgeoning trends such as artificial intelligence (AI), allowing them to capitalize ahead of the herd. Today&CloseCurlyQuote;s losers Alphabet stock (NASDAQ:GOOG) is down by 2.71 per cent, trading at US$156.74 per share as of 11:22 am ET Thursday, and has added 13 per cent year to date. Investors are concerned about the tech giant&CloseCurlyQuote;s ability to compete with Microsoft and OpenAI on the AI front, update its legacy search infrastructure with AI tools to avoid competitive disruptions, and ultimately meet analyst growth estimates. Alphabet will release Q1 2024 results after today&CloseCurlyQuote;s market close. Analysts are expecting revenue of US$66.07 billion (US$58.07 billion in Q1 2023), adjusted earnings per share of US$1.53 (US$1.17 in Q1 2023), cloud revenue of US$9.37 billion (US$7.45 billion in Q1 2023) and ad revenue of US$60.18 billion (US$54.55 billion in Q1 2023). Microsoft stock (NASDAQ:MSFT) is down by 4.10 per cent, trading at US$392.28 per share as of 11:37 am ET, and has added 5.76 per cent year to date. Similar to Alphabet, investors are anticipating potential underperformance against analysts expectations, with Microsoft having already released a slew of AI tools and services since launching its AI chatbot in February 2023. The company will report fiscal Q3 results at market close. Analysts are expecting earnings per share of US$2.83 on revenue of US$60.88 billion, up from US$2.45 and US$52.86 billion year-over-year, respectively, in addition to overall commercial cloud revenue of US$33.93 billion, a 19 per cent year-over-year increase. Amazon stock (NASDAQ:AMZN) is down by 2.75 per cent, trading at US$171.73 per share as of 11:54 am ET, and has added 14.54 per cent year to date. The dip in the stock can be attributed to a generalized downturn in mega-cap U.S. tech stocks, which are increasingly seen as overconcentrated in major stock indices such as the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, though some institutions, such as JP Morgan , view the Magnificent Seven as undervalued. Earlier this week, Amazon announced new features for its tens of thousands of generative AI customers , pressuring Alphabet and Microsoft to keep up their innovative output. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is down by 12.26 per cent, trading at US$433 per share as of 12:12 pm ET, and has added 24.04 per cent year to date. Investors pushed the stock down after it forecasted lower sales and higher expenditures for 2024 and 2025 earlier this morning. Meta now expects to spend US$35 billion-US$40 billion in 2024, up from US$30 billion-US$37 billion, with the figure set to move even higher in 2025, at it advances its LLama AI, which has held its own against OpenAI&CloseCurlyQuote;s ChatGPT and Google&CloseCurlyQuote;s Gemini. The drop in the stock occurred despite the social media company beating analysts&CloseCurlyQuote; Q1 expectations of revenue of US$36.14 billion (US$36.4 billion actual) and EPS of US$4.32 (US$4.71 actual), which are up by 27 per cent and 114 per cent year-over-year, respectively. Today&CloseCurlyQuote;s winners Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) is up by 1.34 per cent, trading at US$164.30 per share as of 12:37 pm ET, and has lost 33.86 per cent year to date. The stock rebounded on news of cheaper models ahead of schedule in 2025, which would allow Tesla to compete with value leaders such as China&CloseCurlyQuote;s BYD. The rebound follows a double-digit fall after a widespread miss of analyst expectations for Q1 2024. Gross margin for Q1 2024 came in at 16.4 per cent, shy of the 17.6 per cent Wall Street expected, while adjusted EPS came to US$0.45, well below Wall Street&CloseCurlyQuote;s estimate of US$0.52. Revenue also failed to impress, falling by 9 per cent to US$21.3 billion, compared with analysts&CloseCurlyQuote; US$22.3 billion consensus figure, in line with an ongoing slump in EV demand . Apple stock (NASDAQ:AAPL) is up by 0.27 per cent, trading at US$169.48 per share as of 12:55 pm ET, and has lost about 9 per cent year to date . The smartphone pioneer&CloseCurlyQuote;s underperformance in 2024 is tied to its minimal exposure to AI, compared with all other Magnificent Seven members, as well as its weakening position in China , the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s largest smartphone market. Apple will release earnings results for Q2 2024 on May 2, with Wall Street expecting US$1.51 in EPS and US$90.83 billion in revenue, a dip from Q1 , when the holiday bump was still in effect. NVIDIA stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) is up by 3.56 per cent, trading at US$825.12 per share as of 1:13 pm ET, and has added 71.30 per cent year to date. The accelerated computing company is riding high after releasing a new chip that brings AI to organizations at up to 25 times lower cost than its predecessor, with Morgan Stanley seeing the stock reaching the US$1,000 mark over the next year. NVIDIA, for its part, expects to almost double revenue from US$60.9 billion in fiscal 2024 (ending in January) to US$112 billion in fiscal 2025, while almost doubling operating profit from US$37.1 billion in fiscal 2024 to US$72.8 billion in fiscal 2025.

{"source_name": "Stockhouse Canada", "title": "Three stocks with multi-bagger potential", "title_link": "https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2024/05/03/three-stocks-with-multi-bagger-potential", "author": " Trevor Abes ", "Description": "When we boil down what separates successful investors from also-rans, we get the ability to identify sources of value with multi-bagger potential, backed by clearly understandable reasons why buying a stock could see you coming out ahead over time. The easiest way to identify multi-bagger stocks is by delving into the information the underlying companies offer you – including official website, financial statements, press releases and investor deck – and piecing together pictures of future operations worth having a stake in. Green flags to look out for include a profitable track record, seasoned and tailor-made management teams, and assets whose current and/or future value isn&CloseCurlyQuote;t fully reflected in the stock price. Because there is no universal way to screen for undervalued companies, knowing that high-PE (price-to-earnings) and low-PE stocks can yield satisfactory returns, it&CloseCurlyQuote;s important to increasingly familiarize yourself with your domestic stock market to catch value dislocation opportunities as they arise. To get your stock Rolodex rolling, here are three names to consider, each of which shared latest developments with Stockhouse over the past week: G Mining Ventures G Mining Ventures is bringing its flagship Tocantinzinho gold project in Brazil into production. The project contains 2 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves, and is slated to begin commercial production in the second half of 2024. A 2022 feasibility study estimates that the project will generate US$1.04 billion in free cash flow over a 10.5-year mine life at a base case of US$1,600 gold, which is 31 per cent lower than Thursday&CloseCurlyQuote;s price of about US$2,315 per ounce. When we pair this wide margin to the current gold price with G Mining Ventures&CloseCurlyQuote; market capitalization of only C$942.1 million, we see multi-bagger upside for existing shareholders, contingent on gold continuing to test all-time-highs and the decorated executive team&CloseCurlyQuote;s ( slide 55 ) ability to put up solid production numbers. Louis-Pierre Gignac, G Mining Ventures&CloseCurlyQuote; president and chief executive officer, sat down with Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Ryan Dhillon to discuss the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s acquisition of Reunion Gold, expediting its path to intermediate gold production. Watch the interview here . G Mining Ventures stock (TSX:GMIN) has added 85.84 per cent year-over-year, and 1,300 per cent since 2019. Mullen Group Mullen Group , one of Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s largest logistics providers, oversees dozens of independently operated businesses active in less-than-truckload, truckload, warehousing, logistics, transload, oversized, third-party logistics and specialized hauling transportation. Besides 75 years of value-accretive acquisitions in these industries, Mullen also provides specialized services for the energy, mining, forestry and construction industries in Western Canada, including water management, fluid hauling and environmental reclamation, granting it diversified operations to better capitalize on rapid market changes. Operating much like Warren Buffett&CloseCurlyQuote;s Berkshire Hathaway, Mullen&CloseCurlyQuote;s decentralized approach has allowed managers to create value idiosyncratically, while being able to rely on the corporate office for capital and financial expertise, legal support, technology and systems support, shared services and strategic planning. And create value they have. Mullen has grown net income by almost 100 per cent over the past five years, from C$72.24 million in 2019 to C$136.72 million in 2023, keeping profits consistent through the COVID pandemic thanks to the essential nature of transporting goods. While the company has been managing costs and pursuing restructuring and productivity initiatives to deal with an expected dip in 2024 construction spending and consumer demand, it generates enough cash to fund future acquisitions, continue growing its profitable operations, and increase its hefty dividend of C$0.72 per share per year. With Mullen Group stock (TSX:MTL) down by about 57 per cent from its 10-year high, it&CloseCurlyQuote;s hard to argue that the market is getting it right in terms of management&CloseCurlyQuote;s business acumen and commitment to shareholder value. Carson Urlacher, Mullen Group&CloseCurlyQuote;s senior financial officer, joined Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Coreena Robertson to discuss the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s financial results for Q1 2024. Watch the interview here . Viva Gold Viva Gold is a junior mining stock developing its Tonopah gold project in Nevada, only about a 30-minute drive from Kinross Gold&CloseCurlyQuote;s Round Mountain mine, which produced 235,690 gold equivalent ounces and housed 1.97 million ounces of proven and probable reserves in 2023. Viva has consistently grown Tonopah&CloseCurlyQuote;s resources from a little more than 35,000 ounces of gold in 2017 to 600,000 ounces in 2022, and is looking to add further ounces after a recently completed 1,515-metre drill program to fill in gaps between programs in 2022 and 2023 . Initial results from this most recent drilling program intercepted a highlight of 50.5 m averaging 0.68 grams per tonne of gold (g/t Au) and 3 g/t silver (Ag). The company followed this up a few weeks later with multiple lengthy sections of high-grade gold, including 90 m at 2 g/t Au, all of which are expected to enhance Tonopah&CloseCurlyQuote;s economics and resource base. James Hesketh, Viva Gold&CloseCurlyQuote;s chief executive officer, joined Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Ryan Dhillon earlier this week to discuss the most recent high-grade gold results from the Tonopah project. Watch the interview here . Sitting at a 62 per cent loss since Tonopah was acquired in 2017, we believe Viva Gold stock (TSXV:VAU) is positioned for a multi-bagger re-rating, as the junior gold miner&CloseCurlyQuote;s high-conviction management team – including a CEO who has led the development and construction of eight mines, and a former geologist at Kinross&CloseCurlyQuote; Round Mountain mine – usher Tonopah into pre-feasibility study work later this year, continuing the project&CloseCurlyQuote;s reliable development track record.

{"source_name": "Stockhouse Canada", "title": "This profitable gold stock is on its way up", "title_link": "https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2024/04/29/this-profitable-gold-stock-on-its-way-up", "author": " Trevor Abes ", "Description": "With gold hitting an all-time high of US$2,346 per ounce on April 26, while blazing a clear path to US$3,000 thanks to ballooning U.S. debt, global geopolitical tensions, falling global interest rates, rising circuitry demand for AI models, and robust central bank purchases as a reserve asset, the opportunity for investors to capture added leverage through gold stocks hasn&CloseCurlyQuote;t been this enticing since 2007&CloseCurlyQuote;s Global Financial Crisis. This is especially true because of physical gold. Gold stocks have a history of outperforming after lagging periods – the last of which has been ongoing since 2021 because of diverted demand into crypto and gold ETFs – creating what Sprott Asset Management describes as the greatest disconnect it has seen in its 25 years of tracking gold. If investors stay true to business fundamentals, favouring top jurisdictions, growth, profitability, and seasoned management to keep operations humming, they stand to reap multi-bagger returns in the gold stock space. A decade-long track record on a path to mid-tier production A compelling mining stock to consider under this gold-equity dislocation thesis is Mandalay Resources (TSX:MND) , a Canadian-based producer operating its Björkdal Gold Mine in Sweden and Costerfield Gold-Antimony Mine in Australia, both generating encumbered cash flows and 100 per cent owned. Mandalay has been in production for more than 10 years, including four consecutive years of profitability since 2020, with an established run-rate between 80,000-100,000 ounces of gold equivalent (AuEq) per year. Output is expected to reach 90,000-100,000 ounces AuEq in 2024, supported by value-accretive estimates in line with decade-long averages ( slide 6 ), including: Average cash costs of US$1,050 – US$1,170 per ounce AuEq Average all-in sustaining costs of US$1,450 – US$1,580 per ounce AuEq Despite Mandalay&CloseCurlyQuote;s profitable production history, its share price remains relatively undervalued in the junior mining space, positioning shareholders to build an underpriced position before gold stocks revert to the mean. A shift seems to have already begun, based on a 12.5 per cent gain for the PHLX Gold and Silver Index, which tracks 30 gold and silver mining companies, versus a 6.3 per cent gain for the SPDR Gold ETF from February 20 to March 20, 2024. With 25,000 ounces AuEq already produced in Q1 2024 and a consolidated exploration budget of US$12 million-US$15 million for the year – well beyond its average annual spend of approximately US$7.5 million since 2015 – Mandalay remains focused on numerous opportunities at Costerfield and Björkdal to extend known mineralization and make near-mine discoveries, in addition to a strong inorganic growth pipeline, with eyes on becoming a mid-tier critical metals producer over the next few years. Let&CloseCurlyQuote;s take a closer look at Mandalay&CloseCurlyQuote;s two flagship assets to better understand the value shareholders stand to reap. The Björkdal Gold Mine The 12,949-hectare Björkdal land package resides in the Boliden mining district, 28 kilometres northwest of Skellefteå, Sweden, where it has been in operation since 1983 near numerous world-class volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) copper, zinc and lead deposits that have been developed for more than a century. Mandalay acquired Björkdal in 2014, operating it as an open-pit and underground mine until 2019, when it transitioned to exclusively underground operations to eliminate high open-pit costs and process higher-margin ore from stockpiles and the Aurora zone. Production stems primarily from the underground zones (70 per cent), in addition to a meaningful contribution from a stockpile of low-grade material (30 per cent), with processing capacity expected to reach 1.45 million tonnes per year by Q2 2024. The Björkdal Gold Mine. Source: Mandalay Resources. The Björkdal gold deposit is found within quartz veins up to several decimeters in width that yield ore for four concentrates currently sold in Sweden and Germany. Interim Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, using a gold price of US$1,800 per ounce, read as follows: 490,000 ounces of proven and probable gold reserves (1.5 million tonnes at 1.32 g/t gold) 1.21 million ounces of measured and indicated (M&I) resources 265,000 ounces of inferred resources Currently boasting a 9-year life-of-mine, Mandalay has consistently replaced reserves and increased M&I resources at Björkdal since 2015 at a competitive discovery cost of US$15 per ounce AuEq (2016 to 2023). A few highlights from last year&CloseCurlyQuote;s drilling campaign include: Intercepts up to 783 g/t gold and 89.5 g/t gold from the Eastern Plunge Extension and Aurora Upper Extension, respectively, in February 2023 Extended mineralized veins at the Eastern Extension Zone up to 116.8 g/t gold and greater evidence for mineralized continuity at the North Zone up to 207 g/t gold in July 2023 As a high-tonnage and low-grade gold mine, these results suggest that Björkdal can drive significant profit growth by favouring higher-grade areas, a strategy management is actively pursuing in 2024 to maximize profit margins. Björkdal achieved production of 11,558 ounces in Q4 2023 , including revenue of US$22.1 million, a 42 per cent increase year-over-year and its strongest quarter since Q1 2022, thanks to elevated gold grades, particularly from the Eastern Extension zone. Full-year 2023 production reached 42,148 ounces, at AISC of US$1,751 per ounce and cash costs of US$1,354 per ounce, and is expected to grow to 43,000-47,000 ounces in 2024, at AISC of US$1,690-US$1,850 and cash costs of US$1,270-US$1,390. Production is well on its way to meeting 2024 guidance, with a Q1 2024 yield of 10,370 gold ounces, a 16 per cent increase year-over-year, with US$3 million-US$4 million earmarked for exploration throughout the year. Key focuses for high-grade resource growth in 2024 ( slide 17 ) include the Eastern Extension, which is open at depth, and new domains near the North Zone and Bo r eal Zone , while bulk mining growth will be sought by extending the Aurora Zone. In terms of regional exploration in 2024 ( slide 18 ), Mandalay will concentrate its efforts on Björkdal-style gold identified through mapping, base-of till-drilling and historic diamond drilling to the east of the mine, and Boliden-style VMS copper-gold to the southwest of the mine, while practicing its ongoing target-generation process based on base-of-till drilling, ground magnetics and induced polarization surveys. The company is updating a long-term block model, which will include drilling up to September 2024, for the filing of a new mineral resource estimate and NI 43-101 technical report slated for March 2025. The Costerfield Gold-Antimony Mine Purchased in 2009, the 1,293-hectare Costerfield project is in the mining mecca of Australia , specifically in the Victorian Gold Belt, which has yielded more than 55 million ounces in historical production. The project, only 30 km from Agnico Eagle&CloseCurlyQuote;s high-grade Fosterville Gold Mine , boasts reserves and resources as of Dec. 31, 2023, that read as follows: 188,000 ounces of gold and 10,600 tonnes of antimony (559,000 tonnes at 10.5 g/t gold and 1.9 per cent antimony) of proven and probable reserves, supposing US$1,800 per ounce of gold and US$11,500 per tonne of antimony 330,000 ounces of gold and 28,800 tonnes of antimony (965,000 tonnes at 10.6 g/t gold and 3 per cent antimony) of measured and indicated resources, and 64,000 ounces of gold and 5,100 tonnes antimony of inferred resources, supposing US$1,900 per ounce of gold and US$12,000 per tonne of antimony Mandalay has consistently maintained a 2- to 5-year reserve life at Costerfield since 2012 ( slide 14 ), including a 3.5-year estimate as of 2023, averaging more than 500,000 ounces AuEq over the period at an average discovery cost of only US$45 per ounce of measured and indicated resources (2010-2023). The company has depleted about 60,000 ounces AuEq per year for a total of 940,000 ounces since 2010, while defining a resource of more than 1.3 million ounces to date, with a gold concentrate sold locally to a refinery in Melbourne, and a gold-antimony concentrate shipped from Melbourne to smelters in China and Oman. Mandalay is Australia&CloseCurlyQuote;s sole producer of antimony, generating up to 5 per cent of global supply per year. The material commands a high price and has posted a strong performance from about US$7,000 per tonne in 2021 to US$13,500 per tonne as of April 2024, thanks to high demand, a dwindling global supply, and its varied uses as a fire retardant, hardener for solar panel glass, and in lead-antimony alloys to improve batteries&CloseCurlyQuote; electrical conductivity, including those of electric vehicles. The Costerfield Gold-Antimony Mine. Source: Mandalay Resources. Production is focused on high-grade material from the Youle and Shepherd deposits, as well as the Augusta mine, to expand mineral reserves and optimize Costerfield&CloseCurlyQuote;s 150,000 tonnes per year processing capacity at its Brunswick plant. Production in 2023 reached 47,661 ounces AuEq (36,057 ounces of gold and 1,860 tonnes of antimony), at AISC of US$1,113 per ounce and cash costs of US$876 per ounce, with a highlight of 15,383 ounces AuEq in Q4 2023, including Mandalay&CloseCurlyQuote;s highest quarterly gold production since Q4 2021 at 13,016 ounces. Output at Costerfield in Q1 2024 came to 14,566 ounces AuEq, about 32 per cent higher year-over-year. Full year 2024 production , estimated at 47,000-53,000 ounces AuEq, with AISC of US$1,080-US$1,260 and cash costs of US$850-US$970, positions Mandalay stock for a positive re-rating, driven by increased profits and potential resource expansion, should gold hold at its generationally high price. Targets for life-of-mine extension in 2024 ( slide 12 ), backed by US$9 million-US$11 million in exploration expenditures, include prospects near multiple Shepherd veins grading as high as 797 g/t gold , indications of Shepherd and Youle-style veins at depth and to the north of Brunswick as high as 25.5 g/t gold , and testing of the northern extension of the Cuffley Deeps and Sub KC, the latter of which intercepted 1,361 g/t gold over 0.09 m and 259 g/t gold over 0.19 m. When it comes to regional exploration targets in 2024 ( slide 13 ), Mandalay has its sights set on True Blue , a new production corridor over 1.5 km in strike length near the Youle workings grading up to 20.2 g/t gold and 20.3 per cent antimony, northern and southern extensions of the Brunswick Line, and a new potential domain at the Costerfield Plunge, continuing the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s monumental 82.9 km of exploration diamond core across 2022 and 2023 combined. The rarified air of profitable microcap mining stocks With less than 1 in 10,000 mineral exploration projects going on to become a mine , only a handful of mining stocks can rely on profits and revenue as a means of investor evaluation, many of which are billions of dollars larger than Mandalay in terms of market capitalization. Coming in at C$221.16 million as of April 26, the gold producer offers exposure to a solid track record of profitability, including US$95.56 million in net income and more than US$60 million in free cash flow (2021-2023) generated from US$773.41 million in revenue since 2020. As of Q1 2024, Mandalay held a cash balance of US$47 million – a 133 per cent increase from US$20.2 million at year-end 2023 – while turning positive on a net debt-to-cash basis in the quarter ( slide 7 ), fortifying the company with a strong balance sheet to execute on imminent drilling, delineate more resources and reserves, and strengthen its case for undervaluation at the current share price. Leadership thriving through the test of time Mandalay Resources&CloseCurlyQuote; stellar track record could, of course, not be achieved without a management team well-versed in mining operations, project development, financing and M&A at large and small companies. Frazer Bourchier, Mandalay Resources&CloseCurlyQuote; president, director and chief executive officer, is a registered engineer with more than 33 years of global mining experience across operational field management and executive leadership. He previously served as: President, CEO and director of Harte Gold from 2020 to 2022 Chief operating officer of Detour Gold from 2018 to 2019 Chief operating officer at Nevsun Resources from 2012 to 2017 An operational executive for two years at Wheaton Precious Metals (TSX:WPM) Mining manager and general manager at the Porgera open-pit gold mine in Papua New Guinea for Placer Dome (subsequently Barr ick Gold (TSX:ABX) ) Bourchier&CloseCurlyQuote;s tailor-made expertise is supported by executives and directors keen on drawing a straight line between profitable production, operational cost controls, strategic exploration and long-term shareholder value creation. Meet them below: Bradford A. Mills, chairman, brings more than 40 years of experience in the resource industry, including as Mandalay&CloseCurlyQuote;s CEO from 2009 to 2016, overseeing its transition to a producing gold company from 2010 onwards. From 2004-2009, Mills was CEO of Lonmin (GBX:LMI), the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s No. 3 platinum and platinum group metals (PGM) producer. Before that, he served as president of the BHP Billiton copper group. Mills is currently a director of Rambler Metals & Mining (AIMM:RMM), a developer and explorer of base and precious metals in Newfoundland and Labrador, Circum Minerals, a private potash development company in Ethiopia, and CNM, a private nickel-copper-cobalt-PGM producing company in Zambia, as well as the founder and managing director of Plinian Capital , a private equity firm investing in natural resource projects and companies. Hashim Ahmed, chief financial officer, has more than 20 years of experience across management, accounting and corporate finance at Barrick Gold, Jaguar Mining (TSX:JAG) and Nova Royalties. Scott Trebilcock, executive vice president and chief development officer (CDO), has spent the past 25 years as a process engineer, management consultant and mining executive, including as CDO of Nevsun Resources, where he was responsible for strategy, corporate development and investor relations, as CEO of junior gold developer KORE Mining (TSXV:KORE) , and as a founder and director of several other junior gold exploration companies. Ryan Austerberry, chief operating officer, boasts more than 18 years of experience in the resource industry across technical and managerial roles. He has worked for Mandalay since 2009, previously serving as corporate manager of technical services, as well as general manager of Björkdal and Costerfield. Chris Davis, vice president of operational geology & exploration, has spent more than 20 years in narrow-vein gold and polymetallic exploration, primarily in Europe and Eastern Australia. Åsa Corin, general manager at Björkdal, has accumulated 18 years of experience in the mining industry, including working as a geologist in Finland, Sweden and Western Australia. Adam Self, general manager at Costerfield, brings more than 25 years of resource industry experience, mostly in underground production, that has seen him progress from operator to supervisor to technical and mine management. The company&CloseCurlyQuote;s leadership team is rounded out by a board of directors made up of mining luminaries, including a second former Mandalay CEO, an advisor and asset manager for more than 20 years who cut her teeth at Morgan Stanley, a 40-year veteran across all facets of international resource exploration, development and production, a lawyer with more than 25 years of corporate legal experience in the mining industry, and a chartered accountant who has raised more than US$750 million and played key roles in several billion dollars&CloseCurlyQuote; worth of corporate transactions. Guided by the focus on optimization that only a few centuries of specialized knowledge can bring, Mandalay has shown itself to be a reliable cash generator with plenty of room to grow, as it explores its more than 14,000-hectare land package and increases its upside to gold&CloseCurlyQuote;s ongoing bull run. A stock on the verge of wider market recognition As should now be evident, though Mandalay stock remains undervalued, it offers an abundance of catalysts for a re-rating, including mines with proven production and expansion potential, profitable operations, and a management team that substantiates its experience on the income statement. Overhead shot at the Costerfield Mine. Source: Mandalay Resources. The stock is further de-risked by 76 per cent institutional ownership, spread across Plinian Capital&CloseCurlyQuote;s CE Mining (25 per cent), GMT Capital (20 per cent), Ruffer LLP (19 per cent), and AzValor (12 per cent), in addition to a buy rating from Brian Quast, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets , and a share buyback program announced in February 2024, which proves management is well aware of the market&CloseCurlyQuote;s unjustified reluctance to reward the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s value-accretive results. With MND shares having added only 138 per cent since 2019, tracking the past few years of profitability, investors are being gifted an opportunity to own a stake in a model miner, whose growth runway is only beginning to unfold.

Meet Revive Therapeutics (CSE:RVV) a Toronto-based company that has immense potential to capitalize on this under-met market. As it currently stands, no approved treatment is available for symptoms of long COVID, but Revive Therapeutics could potentially change that landscape. Case in point, the company recently announced it has locked in a meeting request with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Revive LC POC Lateral Flow Test Kit. Revive advances towards long COVID treatment In a news release, the company stated the meeting with the FDA is for the purpose of providing feedback on the classification, development and regulatory submission strategy for a point-of-care in vitro diagnostic device that can detect post COVID-19 conditions. Under its wholly owned subsidiary, Revive Therapeutics is advancing the project as a potential blood biomarker diagnosis that identifies long COVID. Because there is no FDA-approved long-COVID treatment, Revive Therapeutics&CloseCurlyQuote; kit could be a game changer in space. Case in point, roughly 10 per cent of COVID-19 cases result in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections. It is estimated that roughly 200 symptoms have been identified as a result of long COVID, including fatigue, brain fog, breathing difficulties and cardiovascular symptoms such as chest pain, arrhythmias, and even sudden cardiac death. The company said its upcoming meeting with the FDA is expected to take place June 27. In addition to its upcoming meeting with the federal agency, the company also stated it has entered into a license agreement with the Lawson Health Research Institute for global exclusive rights to the intellectual property of novel blood biomarkers that make up long COVID. The intellectual property includes “Blood Biomarkers in Long COVID19″; “Biomarkers in Long COVID19″; and “Diagnosis and Treatment of Long COVID.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Revive Therapeutics updates Revive Therapeutics also revealed some corporate updates, including its research and development of Bucillamine which is also being evaluated for the treatment of nerve agent exposure. Essentially nerve agents are chemicals that affect the nervous system and are highly toxic. Exposure to nerve agents can cause tightness of the chest, excessive salivation, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, blurred vision, tremors and death. Together with the Defence R&D Canada – Suffield Research Centre, an agency of the Canadian Department of National Defence, the company is evaluating Bucillamine as a potential treatment for nerve agent exposure. Bucillamine is an oral thiol-based drug with anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, that can potentially treat nerve agent exposure as well as having the potential to treat long COVID. Revive Therapeutics stated that it aims to advance the clinical development of Bucillamine by using published research from its previous Phase 3 clinical study. As such, the company is preparing a clinical package that includes a proposed Phase 2/3 clinical protocol for long COVID to present to the FDA and international health regulatory bodies. Last year, the company announced the results of its study evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral Bucillamine in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.

Looking for an entry point into this market with a company that has not only delivered results but has significant room to grow? Leading Edge Materials Corp. (TSXV:LEM) offers an exciting proposition as it stands at the forefront of the critical raw materials sector, focusing on developing a portfolio of projects strategically located within the European Union. With a commitment to supplying essential elements for high-growth technologies such as batteries for electromobility and energy storage, as well as permanent magnets for electric motors and wind power, Leading Edge Materials is ready to play a vital role in Europe&CloseCurlyQuote;s transition towards climate neutrality. Portfolio overview Leading Edge Materials boasts a diverse portfolio of projects, including: Woxna Graphite Mine: A wholly owned asset in Sweden, the Woxna Graphite Mine has the potential to address the looming demand-supply deficit in flake graphite. With plans to develop a downstream anode business, Woxna aims to capitalize on Europe&CloseCurlyQuote;s growing need for domestic anode production. Many analysts predict a six- to sevenfold increase in graphite demand by 2030, amongst the most severe of any commodity. Built and permitted, Leading Edge has kept the Woxna graphite mine and plant on care and maintenance, while monitoring market signals to consider a restart of graphite concentrate production. Norra Karr Heavy Rare Earth Element (HREE) Project: Also in Sweden and positioned as one of the largest HREE deposits globally and the most advanced in the E.U., Norra Karr holds significant promise for Western magnet producers. As Europe seeks to secure a stable supply chain for critical raw materials, Norra Karr emerges as a cornerstone supplier. The Swedish government has signaled legislative changes that has seen the company proceed with their mining lease application, which they expect to submit within 12 months. Bihor Sud Nickel Cobalt Exploration Project: With rapid advancements since obtaining permission to enter underground galleries, this Romanian project presents substantial potential for scale and high-grade mineralization. Leading Edge&CloseCurlyQuote;s exploration efforts aim to uncover the full extent of the mineralization&CloseCurlyQuote;s depth and breadth. In situ samples from G7 gallery walls have assayed up to 30% Ni and 4.7% Co, while surface trench assay results indicate a zone of Pb-Zn-Ag mineralization. Further results confirm the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s belief that this is a high prospective exploration project, and the company plans a spring surface drill program on 50-100 m deep geophysical anomalies and to explore the depth extent of G7 Co-Ni-mineralization. E.U.&CloseCurlyQuote;s focus on critical raw materials The E.U. identifies critical raw materials based on their economic importance and supply risk. These materials are pivotal for technologies driving the clean energy transition, making them essential for achieving climate neutrality goals. Leading Edge Materials&CloseCurlyQuote; projects align closely with the E.U.&CloseCurlyQuote;s vision, positioning the company as a key player in Europe&CloseCurlyQuote;s strategic initiatives. In a letter to shareholders , the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s interim CEO, Eric Krafft, pointed to recent comments from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen who said in her recent annual State of the Union address that the next phase of the European Green Deal will see a broad industrial policy using the climate agenda to improve competitiveness. Concerns were voiced that Asian supply chains are outcompeting and that U.S. green subsidy schemes are undercutting European businesses. It all starts with access to raw materials and process technologies. Outlook for the future As European policy initiatives continue to evolve, the demand for critical raw materials is expected to surge. Leading Edge Materials anticipates significant opportunities arising from initiatives like the Critical Raw Materials Act and the Net-Zero Industry Act . With a proactive approach to addressing market needs, the company is well-positioned for growth and innovation. Investment corner Investors looking to capitalize on Europe&CloseCurlyQuote;s clean energy transition should consider Leading Edge Materials Corp. Given its affordable C$22 million market cap, the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s stock performance on the TSX Venture showcases its potential for substantial gains.

{"source_name": "Stockhouse Canada", "title": "How to invest in REITs", "title_link": "https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2024/04/22/how-to-invest-reits", "author": " Trevor Abes ", "Description": "With analysts predicting that the Bank of Canada will cut its policy interest rate sometime this summer , 26 per cent of potential homebuyers sitting on the sidelines in anticipation, and more than 85 per cent of renters and home owners finding housing costs to be more expensive year-over-year, Canadian property values are positioned for a near-term upside surprise, making it a prospective time to learn how to invest in real estate investment trusts (REITs). How to invest in REITs 1. What are REITs and how do they work? A real estate investment trust owns, operates or finances real estate properties that generate income for their investors, who benefit from buying shares in the company while sidestepping the hassles of buying, managing and financing individual properties. REITs are popularly sought after for their high distributions, a feature tied to their legal obligation to pay out 100 per cent of their taxable income in Canada and 90 per cent in the United States, which might come from rent, asset sales or management services. The TSX REIT Index generated an average annual return of 9.7 per cent from 1997 to 2013, well ahead of the TSX&CloseCurlyQuote;s approximately 7 per cent, while U.S. REITs achieved an 11.4 per cent return over the past 25 years, outperforming the S&P 500&CloseCurlyQuote;s 7.6 per cent effort, with outperformance positioned to continue if borrowing conditions fall back in line with the post-Great Financial Crisis average. 2. What kind of REITs can you buy? Most REITs can be classified as equity REITs , which operate as large-scale landlords, collecting rent in exchange for accommodations, customer service, and long-term property maintenance and upkeep. The nature of property portfolios is as diverse as there are passions to pursue, spanning retail (malls, self-storage, businesses), residential (single and multi-family, hotels), infrastructure (fibre cables, telecom towers, energy pipelines), healthcare, offices, or a diversified focus across multiple sectors. You can buy equity REITs on major securities exchanges like you would a single stock, with the tickers being distinguishable by their .REIT or .UN endings. According to Edward Jones , 43 REITs were listed on the TSX as of December 2019. If a budding real estate entrepreneur isn&CloseCurlyQuote;t interested in property management, he or she can found a mortgage REIT instead, which lends money to facilitate acquisitions and holds a loan portfolio either directly or through mortgage-backed securities. Hybrid REITs, for their part, practice a strategy that borrows from their mortgage and equity counterparts. Investors can also buy ownership stakes in private REITs , which aren&CloseCurlyQuote;t registered with securities authorities, and can therefore have more lax governance standards compared with publicly listed companies. Private opportunities, often limited to institutional and accredited investors, aren&CloseCurlyQuote;t attractive investments for most people, unless they have specialized real estate knowledge and are prepared to make a substantial allocation. Investors can allocate into these four varieties of REITs through individual companies, or through funds, such as mutual funds or exchanged-traded funds (ETFs) , that build and own portfolios based on mandates that will differ in terms of investment style, geographical reach and sector-specific focus. 3. What are the risks and benefits of investing in REITs? Like any investment, the particular mechanics of REITs will only apply to certain investors based on their financial goals, risk tolerance and time horizon. We can broadly characterize these investors as: Income-seeking, meaning they might be retired, unable to work full time, or simply require a certain minimum income to meet their spending needs. Requiring of stock exposure, as publicly listed REITs have provided returns above the TSX and S&P 500, while suffering from comparatively less, but still substantial annual volatility , averaging between 10-20 per cent. REITs&CloseCurlyQuote; propensity to track stock market volatility, despite being about 25 per cent less volatile over the long term, according to data from Hartford Funds and Ned Davis Research, means they require long time horizons for investors to stand a decent chance at making money. Morningstar provides probabilities for losses tied to 20- and 30-year minimum holding periods for prospective stock investors. With this ideal REIT investor framework in mind, let&CloseCurlyQuote;s turn our attention to the benefits you could enjoy and the risks you must take by holding REITs in your portfolio. Benefits Easy to buy and sell, supposing they trade on public exchanges, saving investors the headaches and high capital requirements of buying physical properties and screening tenants to fill them with. Diversification into an essential industry that is arguably underrepresented in the TSX at only 2 per cent, given Statista ‘s forecast that the Canadian real estate market will surpass US$8 trillion in 2024. Real estate offers a strong case for low correlation and long-term outperformance compared with stocks and bonds. The potential to outperform broad-market stock indexes like the TSX or S&P 500, should your funds or individual REIT picks turn out to be winners (more on how to pick REITs in the next section). Stable income to fund your short-term spending needs, contingent on management operating the property portfolio efficiently and cost-effectively. Risks Little to no capital to pursue expansion opportunities without diluting shareholders or taking out debt because of their high income payout requirements, making it more difficult to achieve share-price appreciation. Sensitivity to interest rates , given REITs&CloseCurlyQuote; propensity to lend money and issue debt, leading to periods of heightened volatility, such as during the COVID pandemic, which saw property values soar in anticipation of higher rates, only to fall back down to Earth as rates reached a generational high. Sector-specific risks, like hotels suffering during economic downturns and office space suffering during the ongoing post-COVID work-from-home trend. Potential tax complexity , if held in a non-registered or brokerage account, considering that REIT distributions may classify as dividends, capital gains, income, or return of capital, and often include all four. Now that we&CloseCurlyQuote;ve covered the basics about how REITs work and what they offer to investors, we can carry on to explaining how to pick the best REITs for your portfolio. 4. How should you evaluate REITs to invest in? From a bird&CloseCurlyQuote;s eye-view, putting your hard-earned money to work in a REIT depends on the probability of its business plan working out over your time horizon. This probability must be expressed as a percentage range, because investment research is by nature part art and part science and can be delineated by considering the following factors: A profitable track record measured by reliable distribution increases and consistent adjusted funds from operations , which is calculated as net income minus the sale of property, capital expenditures and non-cash deductions such as depreciation and amortization. The largest Canadian REIT by market capitalization, Choice Properties REIT (TSX:CHP.UN) , at C$9.38 billion, has been profitable in each of the past four years, raking in more than C$2 billion combined, while generating a return of 6.69 per cent since 2014, on top of a 5.8 per cent annual distribution. A debt-to-equity ratio that is controlled or shrinking, demonstrating responsible borrowing practices. A debt to-EBITDA ratio below 1, such that the REIT&CloseCurlyQuote;s leases generate enough cash to cover distributions and debt payments. Investors can use Yahoo Finance&CloseCurlyQuote;s stock screener to isolate real estate stocks based on debt-to-equity and debt-to-EBITDA to align themselves with leverage appropriate to their financial situations. A net interest margin , or the spread between interest earned on mortgage loans and the cost of funding the loans, that is stable or rising, demonstrating efficient evaluations of client creditworthiness. An occupancy rate that has improved over the long term and is free of any glaring gaps. Granite REIT (TSX:GRT.UN) , a logistics, warehouse and industrial specialist in North America and Europe, scored the highest in terms of occupancy rate, coming in at 99.6 per cent in a September 2023 study by The Globe and Mail detailing 18 safe and undervalued Canadian REITs. A management team with multiple decades of experience in their real estate sub-sectors of choice, and a history of closing deals in line with the business plan they&CloseCurlyQuote;re selling you. If individual company research isn&CloseCurlyQuote;t a rabbit hole you&CloseCurlyQuote;re prepared to dive into, you can invest in REIT funds that offer exposure to broader portfolios with dozens or hundreds of holdings. Here are key factors to consider when choosing a REIT fund: Fees : The lower the fees you pay, the more of the fund&CloseCurlyQuote;s potential returns will end up in your pocket. Performance : The longer a fund has generated a return sufficient to meet your financial goals, the more likely it is to continue doing so, all things being equal. Investment strategy : Certain REIT funds, such as iShares&CloseCurlyQuote; S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index ETF (TSX:XRE) , practice an index-based strategy that invests in a group of stocks meant to represent an entire market, in this case, the Canadian REIT market. Other funds, like the CI Canadian REIT ETF (TSX:RIT) , take a more active approach, using proprietary research processes to chose REITs on your behalf that will outperform compared with their peers and the market as a whole. Despite there being ample evidence in support of index investing&CloseCurlyQuote;s superior long-term returns compared with active stock pickers, a disciplined approach with a strong tolerance for volatility, as RIT demonstrates, can outperform the broader REIT market over time. 5. How do you buy shares in a REIT? Once you have a list of REITs you&CloseCurlyQuote;d like to own, simply head over to your online investment platform and place your orders. Remember to chose a limit order and to set a per-share price one or two cents above the ask price to make sure your orders are filled. Market orders , more appropriate for traders, will buy or sell at the quickest available price, which might be well above or below the current bid or ask price, and should be avoided by long-term investors. If you haven&CloseCurlyQuote;t opened an investment account yet, check out Questrade or Wealthsimple for low-fee options with seamless user experiences. These are the main accounts you can open in Canada depending on your circumstances: The Registered Retirement Savings Plan , or RRSP, where each dollar you contribute can grow tax-deferred and be knocked off your taxable income in the current year, or any future year you choose until you turn 71. The Tax-Free Savings Account , or TFSA, where owners keep all of their investment gains without having to pay taxes on them. A non-registered or taxable account , which obliges investors to add 50 per cent of all capital gains and 100 per cent of interest accrued (including REITs) to their taxable income. Investors can also use capital losses to reduce taxable capital gains in the current year, any future year, and up to three years in the past. Canadians can also benefit from the Registered Disability Savings Plan and Registered Education Savings Plan subject to eligibility requirements. Having made your purchases, and positioned yourself to benefit from exposure to the universal need to have a roof over our heads, all that&CloseCurlyQuote;s left to do is manage your investments according to your needs. This means not letting your REIT allocation grow beyond a balance between your risk tolerance and financial goals – whether that entails trimming your holdings or buying during periods of undervaluation – and transitioning to safer instruments such as cash and bonds once your investments grow enough to fund your original purpose for investing. Now that you&CloseCurlyQuote;re a property owner, you might want to expand your real estate knowledge to other sub-sectors poised for value creation.

It has grown to a market capitalization of C$1.7 trillion as of April 18, attracted investments from hundreds of publicly available stocks, and has posted returns of 113.14 per cent year-over-year, and approximately 20,000 per cent going back a decade, currently trading at about C$87,000 per coin. The cryptocurrency operates through a blockchain, which is a ledger that records transactions between Bitcoin users. To validate transactional data on a block and add it to the blockchain, miners must compete to solve complex equations, with the winner receiving a pre-determined amount of Bitcoin. With the upcoming halving expected on April 19-20, 2024, miners will suffer a 50 per cent reduction in Bitcoin rewards for each block they add to the cryptocurrency&CloseCurlyQuote;s blockchain. Halvings occur every four years and will continue until capping the supply of Bitcoins at 21 million in 2140. Logically, halvings have an inflationary effect on Bitcoin&CloseCurlyQuote;s price, and they have proven this out in practice with triple-digit rallies the past three times it happened in 2020, 2016 and 2012. These rallies are, in turn, reflected in Bitcoin and crypto-related stocks, making it an opportune time to highlight top performers and why they might merit an allocation. The top 10 Bitcoin stocks and ETFs to consider before the halving 1. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust invests exclusively and passively in Bitcoin, saving investors the hassle of buying, storing and protecting Bitcoin directly. The fund has accumulated a little more than US$19.5 billion in assets under management, which translates to about 310,000 Bitcoins, making it the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s largest Bitcoin ETF. Investors will need to pay a steep total expense ratio of 1.5 per cent to own the fund, but benefit from unparalleled experience because GBTC was the first fund to make Bitcoin publicly available in 2013. The spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund ( NASDAQ:GBTC ) last traded at US$56.44 per share and has added 229.29 per cent year-over-year. 2. CleanSpark CleanSpark , market capitalization US$3.8 billion, is a Bitcoin miner that owns and operates low-emissions data centres. The company has deployed 106,000 miners as of February 2024, with a full deployment capacity of 215,000 miners and an option for an additional 100,000. The company holds 3,573 Bitcoins in treasury and is well-funded with US$74 million in cash to reach a projected hashrate of 50 EH/s by 2025. The Bitcoin mining stock ( NASDAQ:CLSK ) last traded at US$16.28 per share and has added 223.65 per cent year-over-year. 3. Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF The Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF (TSX:FBTC) , with C$424 million in AUM, holds a little more than 5,000 Bitcoins and benefits from vertical integration, making use of Fidelity&CloseCurlyQuote;s in-house storage capabilities, as well as the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s well-established history in active management dating back to the 1940s. FBTC charges a high management expense ratio of 0.95 per cent, but has more than made up for it with year-over-year returns of 114.03 per cent, last trading at C$28.83 per share. 4. Galaxy Digital Holdings Galaxy Digital Holdings , established in 2018 and now with a market capitalization of C$3.87 billion, is one of the largest digital asset and blockchain investors and advisors. It serves institutions, startups and qualified individuals through a diversified suite of services, including trading, lending, strategic advisory services, proprietary Bitcoin mining and hosting, network validation and enterprise crypto custody. The crypto investor and asset manager&CloseCurlyQuote;s sporadic profitability, which can be attributed to crypto&CloseCurlyQuote;s high volatility, undersells its trusted reputation as a go-to source for industry insights. Galaxy stock ( TSX:GLXY ) last traded at C$11.60 per share and has added 109.39 per cent year-over-year. 5. Ishares Bitcoin Trust The Ishares Bitcoin Trust , like Grayscale and Fidelity&CloseCurlyQuote;s product above, provides exposure to Bitcoin within traditional investment accounts like RRSPs, TFSAs, 401Ks and Roth IRAs. The fund has accumulated US$16.6 billion in AUM, or just over 270,000 Bitcoins, making it the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s second-largest Bitcoin ETF, while charging a fee of just 0.25 per cent, which is comparable to broad-market stock index funds .

The outsized risk at the heart of Bitcoin&CloseCurlyQuote;s investment prospects If, like many Bitcoin enthusiasts, you support the cryptocurrency&CloseCurlyQuote;s potential to reduce barriers into the financial system for the underbanked and unbanked, and believe this potential will continue to translate into wider adoption and price appreciation, it would be reasonable to temper your convictions with a handful of facts: Bitcoin was launched only in 2009, making its return history unreliable for future expectations, unlike the 150 years of data available for the S&P 500 The cryptocurrency has been officially recognized as a currency by only one country, El Salvador , with mixed results Huge regulatory risk exists, with China having banned crypto trading and mining since 2021, setting a precedent for other powerful countries to do the same to safeguard their national currencies, at the expense of investors experiencing a total loss For these reasons, it&CloseCurlyQuote;s hard to argue for anything but a minimal allocation to crypto, whether directly or through stocks, unless you possess specialized knowledge that offers you an edge against other investors.

Copper and other critical metal prices have also been trending upward lately, and this all spells good news for the likes of Northstar Gold Corp. (CSE:NSG) , who has been advancing a number of quality high-grade gold and copper exploration targets in Ontario&CloseCurlyQuote;s prolific Kirkland Lake District. The gold and copper miner recently unveiled intriguing results from its comprehensive LiDAR and MMI (mobile metal ion) soil surveys conducted at the Rosegrove Property, 13 km south of Kirkland Lake, ON. The company is also awaiting results from borehole electromagnetic (BHEM) and surface electromagnetic (EM) surveys to define extensions of high-grade copper VMS mineralization recently defined at the Cam Copper Mine area on its nearby Miller Copper-Gold Property. These developments mark significant progress in the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s exploration endeavors, underscoring its commitment to uncovering valuable mineral resources. Rosegrove and Miller Copper-Gold Properties: Unveiling promising gold and copper deposits, trends and anomalies Figure 1. Rosegrove Property MMI Au-Zn-Cu Trends and Miller Copper Gold Cam Copper and Allied Gold Zones (Source: Northstar Gold Corp.) Northstar&CloseCurlyQuote;s wholly-owned Rosegrove Property spans an impressive 11.5 square km in size. A 2021 property-wide UAV magnetic survey and more recent Rosegrove LiDAR and MMI surveys have delineated multiple coincidental magnetic, structural and soil geochemical gold anomalies (up to 17 times background) associated with the regional first-order Pacaud Fault Zone. The Pacaud Fault Zone has long been recognized as a favourable geological setting for hosting gold mineralization. Northstar Gold&CloseCurlyQuote;s identification of these anomalies further validates the property&CloseCurlyQuote;s prospectivity and underscores the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s keen understanding of geological indicators. Figure 2. (Rosegrove Property Gridded MMI Response Ratio for Gold with Anomalous Areas A and E. Source: Northstar Gold Corp.) Several critical minerals anomalies were also identified by the Rosegrove MMI survey, which strongly suggests that volcanogenic exhalite horizons with possible polymetallic volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) lenses are present in the south portion of the Rosegrove survey grid. Two distinct copper trends and zinc anomalies (up to 122 times background) possibly represent a 3 km northwest strike extension of the Boston Creek (Cam) VMS Copper Trend, defined to the southeast on the nearby Miller Copper-Gold Property. Figure 3. Rosegrove Property Gridded MMI Response Ratio for Cu with Anomalous Areas A and E. Source: Northstar Gold Corp.) In an interview with the Market Online, Northstar&CloseCurlyQuote;s CEO, Brian Fowler said that these results confirm that the team&CloseCurlyQuote;s efforts are being conducted on the right type of rocks in the right area. Miller Copper-Gold Property: Advancing exploration efforts Northstar&CloseCurlyQuote;s Miller Copper-Gold Property hosts the near-surface Allied Gold Zone deposit (upper SRK (Canada) Exploration Target range > 500,000 ounces of gold averaging 2.04 g/t), open to expansion (Figure 1). Northstar Gold&CloseCurlyQuote;s exploration efforts at Miller extend beyond gold, as demonstrated by its more recent copper focus on the Miller Copper-Gold Property. Located 18 km southeast of Kirkland Lake, Ontario, this property also encompasses the historic Cam Copper Mine, a road-accessible shaft mine with a rich history as a small-scale producer of high-grade ‘direct shipping&CloseCurlyQuote; copper ore. Northstar completed a four-hole, shallow diamond drill program at Cam Copper Mine in late 2023, confirming a VMS nature to high-grade copper mineralization with each hole intersecting multiple massive chalcopyrite, high-grade copper horizons grading up to 14.8 per cent copper over 2.5 metres. Figure 4. (Cam Copper Mine 3D Model and 2023 Drill Results. Source: Northstar Gold Corp.) In late fall 2023, Northstar conducted a limited prospecting and sampling program covering the southeast extension of the Cam Copper VMS/exhalite trend along the contact with the Round Lake Batholith. 15 grab samples were collected in proximity to magnetic anomalies, historic ground and airborne EM conductors and IP bedrock targets, returning anomalous values in Gold (Au, 0 – 2.02 g/t Au), Silver (Ag, 0.15 – 26.9 g/t), Copper (Cu, 41 ppm – 27,900 ppm), Lead (Pb, 0.9 ppm – 3340 ppm) and Zinc (Zn, 12ppm – 2070 ppm). These samples could represent extensions of VMS Zones 1 and 2 up to 900 metres along strike to the southeast of the Cam Copper Mine site. In late March, 2024 Northstar commenced a surface EM survey to define Cam Copper VMS horizon extensions and conductors at depth and over a 900-metre strike length towards the southeast, with a priority to identify areas with thicker accumulations of Cu-rich massive sulphides. A borehole BHEM survey has also been conducted on select 2023 Cam Copper diamond drill holes. Similar Pulse-EM technology and surveys lead to several previous VMS discoveries across Canada, including Hudbay Minerals&CloseCurlyQuote; 2003 Lalor VMS deposit discovery in Manitoba. Northstar is currently awaiting results from the recently completed borehole electromagnetic (BHEM) and surface electromagnetic (EM) surveys. Northstar will follow up 2023 Cam Copper trend surface sample and 2024 EM survey results and targets in the spring of 2024, with prospecting, geological mapping, sampling and a Phase II diamond drill program. Figure 5. (Cam Copper Mine VMS Trend and 2024 EM Survey Area. Source: Northstar Gold Corp.) Looking ahead: Ongoing exploration initiatives Northstar Gold Corp.&CloseCurlyQuote;s dual focus on gold and copper exploration is underscored by its ongoing exploration initiatives. The company remains committed to advancing its properties and creating shareholder value through systematic exploration programs aimed at delineating high-potential copper and gold deposits and exploration targets. Investment corner: A promising opportunity In light of the recent developments at both the Rosegrove and Miller properties, Northstar Gold Corp. presents a compelling investment opportunity for discerning investors. With promising gold and copper anomalies identified at Rosegrove and ongoing exploration activities targeting VMS copper and alkalic gold-telluride mineralization at Miller, the company is well-positioned to deliver significant value appreciation. As it currently stands, shares of Northstar Gold are priced at C$0.045 with a market capitalization of C$4.4 million. Despite its affordable stock price, Northstar Gold has plenty of room to soar, particularly as it makes headway exploring its top-tier assets. Investors seeking exposure to both gold and copper markets, backed by robust exploration initiatives and promising geological indicators, should consider Northstar Gold Corp. as an attractive addition to their investment portfolios. As the company continues to execute its exploration strategy and unlock the mineral potential of its properties, investors stand to benefit from the anticipated growth and value creation.

The metal has added 62 per cent since 2018 to US$2,410 per ounce, as of 1:42 pm ET Friday, and has grown by almost 5x since the Global Financial Crisis, propelled by widespread investor fear about interest rates, fiat currency devaluation, and rising geopolitical tensions such as the Israel-Iran Conflict. Studies from Sprott , Mining.com , Kitco and The Globe and Mail all document underperformance among gold mining stocks compared with their target commodity, identifying a high-potential opportunity to own quality operations trading at irrationally low valuations given their track records. Here are three names to consider for due diligence as you ease into the weekend: Goldflare Exploration Goldflare Exploration , established in 2003, is a Quebec-based mineral exploration company with a diversified portfolio of properties, each of which benefits from favourable geological settings near comprehensive infrastructure. The company owns land along a broad corridor with evidence of significant mineralization , including Aiguebelle-Goldfields, Syenite Condor, Ranger (all 100 per cent owned), and Destorbelle (50 per cent Goldflare, 50 per cent Axe Exploration). An additional project, Duplessis-Agar, shows a high potential for gold. David Corbeil-Heneault, Goldflare&CloseCurlyQuote;s chief financial officer, joined Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Coreena Robertson earlier this week to discuss the delineation of new targets on the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s Goldfields property. Watch the interview here . Results at Goldfields in 2023 over a 100-metre strike length confirm the presence of gold, yielding a high grade of 113 g/t over 1 m in hole AIG-23-13, and 1.3 g/t gold over 22.8 m, including 5.8 g/t gold over 2.4 m, in hole AIG-23-26. Goldflare stock (TSXV:GOFL) last traded at C$0.025 per share. The stock has given back 58.33 per cent year-over-year, and 16.67 per cent since 2018. Xali Gold Our next mining stock pick is Xali Gold , which owns and operates gold and silver exploration projects in Peru and Mexico. Its flagship El Oro project in Mexico boasts 8 million ounces of past gold production and houses multiple veins with excellent drill-demonstrated discovery potential. The company is currently evaluating 31 targets to expand mineralization. The value proposition at El Oro is sweetened by: The recently sold El Oro tailings operation with an inferred resource of 119,900 ounces of gold and 3,061,200 ounces of silver poised to produce short-term cash flow ( slide 13 ) The SDA flotation plant and precious metals leach circuit ( slide 15 ), which has a decade-long operating history at 100 tonnes per day and is already cash flowing at US$150,000 per month until September 2024 under a rent-to-purchase agreement The Tres Marias property in Peru, which houses numerous vein systems and alteration zones, and has yielded rock chip samples as high as 0.4 m at 503 g/t silver Joey Freeze, Xali Gold&CloseCurlyQuote;s chief executive officer, sat down with Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Ryan Dhillon earlier this week to discuss the sale of the El Oro tailings operation. Watch it here . Xali Gold stock (TSXV:XGC) last traded at C$0.06 per share. The stock is flat year-over-year and has added 100 per cent since 2018, with further upside to be reaped should the company identify an economically extractable recovery. GoGold Resources GoGold is a Canadian silver and gold producer operating, developing, exploring and acquiring high-quality projects in Mexico. The gold stock&CloseCurlyQuote;s flagship Parral Tailings mine in the state of Chihuahua has produced between 300,000 to more than 600,000 ounces of silver equivalent since 2018, and it features a proven and probable mineral reserve of 171,000 ounces of gold and 16.57 million ounces of silver. Its Los Ricos South and Los Ricos North exploration projects in the state of Jalisco feature 2023 preliminary economic assessments detailing net present values of US$458 million (1.25 million ounces of gold equivalent measured and indicated) and US$413 million (1.1 million ounces of gold equivalent measured and indicated), respectively. Bradley Langille, GoGold Resources&CloseCurlyQuote; president and chief executive officer, joined Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Ryan Dhillon earlier this week to discuss production figures for the quarter ending March 31. The company posted production of 375,745 silver equivalent ounces, including 138,657 silver ounces, 2,184 gold ounces, 93 tonnes of copper and 92 tonnes of zinc. Watch the interview here . GoGold Resources stock (TSX:GGD) last traded at C$1.35 per share. The stock is down by 28.95 per cent year-over-year, but has gained 213.95 per cent since 2018, supported by consistent production of in-demand commodities, US$50 million in profit since 2019, and a strong cash balance of US$95 million as of December 2023 to complete a definitive feasibility study on Los Ricos South, amid other value-accretive goals planned for 2024.

{"source_name": "Stockhouse Canada", "title": "The impact of Israel-Iran conflict on global markets", "title_link": "https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2024/04/19/the-impact-israel-iran-conflict-on-global-markets", "author": "Jonathon Brown", "Description": "The sudden escalation between Israel and Iran has sent shockwaves through global markets, prompting a significant downturn In Canada, the TSX Composite Index dipped initially but regained ground as investors sought refuge in defensive sectors such as utilities and healthcare Markets have been moving lower in response to the conflict, largely fuelled by fear among investors regarding the potential for further escalation and its impact on various industries Beyond the immediate sectors directly impacted by the conflict, such as defense and energy, the ripple effects of geopolitical tensions can reverberate throughout the broader supply chain In April 2024, tensions between Israel and Iran reached a boiling point, resulting in a targeted attack by Iran on Israeli soil. This sudden escalation has sent shockwaves through global markets, prompting a significant downturn as investors grapple with the uncertainty and potential ramifications of heightened geopolitical tensions. Since last Friday, key indices in Canada and the United States have experienced fluctuations in response to escalating tensions between Iran and Israel. In Canada, the TSX Composite Index dipped initially but regained ground as investors sought refuge in defensive sectors such as utilities and healthcare. Similarly, in the United States, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average initially faltered before recovering, buoyed by gains in technology and consumer staples. Stock markets worldwide have been moving lower in response to the conflict, largely fuelled by fear among investors regarding the potential for further escalation and its impact on various industries. Three key sectors have been particularly affected by the current flare-up in tensions. 1. Energy industry: The energy industry is one of the most sensitive sectors to geopolitical unrest, and the Israel-Iran conflict is no exception. With Iran being a major player in the oil market, any disruption to the region&CloseCurlyQuote;s stability threatens to send fuel prices skyrocketing. Last week, oil prices surged to a six-month high in response to the escalating tensions. Higher oil and commodity prices could potentially translate into a boost in share prices for energy companies, albeit at the expense of consumers and other industries reliant on affordable energy. U.S. crude futures traded $0.39 higher on Friday April 19th at $83.12 a barrel, and the Brent contract added $0.24 to $87.35 a barrel. 2. Airline and travel industry: The airline and travel industry has also felt the impact of the Israel-Iran conflict. Several airlines, including Air Canada (TSX:AC) , United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and EasyJet (OTCQX:ESYJY) , have suspended flights to Tel Aviv amid security concerns. This disruption not only affects the bottom line of airlines but also has broader implications for global travel and tourism, which rely on stability and ease of access to destinations. Air Canada stock is up 5.52 per cent this week, trading at C$19.67 United Airlines stock is up 21.08 this week, trading at C$70.61 EasyJet stock is only 0.15 per cent lower this week (but moved nearly 1 per cent higher on the London Stock Exchange) at C$910.54 3. Defence stocks: Amidst the uncertainty and threat of escalating conflict, defence stocks have emerged as potential beneficiaries. Companies involved in the production of weapons and armaments stand to gain from increased military spending and demand for defence capabilities. The United States, in particular, has historically allocated significant resources to defence expenditures, with post-9/11 wars contributing substantially to economic growth in certain sectors, according to Brown University estimates. Though it is hard to say what would happen on the front lines, back home, defence also means security. Companies that use AI to enhance their security platforms, such as Liberty Defense Holdings (TSXV:SCAN) or Xtract One Technologies (TSX:XTRA) stand to benefit the most. In 2021, Canada spent roughly US$26.5 billion on defence, which is an increase of around US$3 billion from 2020. To that end, Bombardier Inc. (TSX:BBD) aircraft are used in government and military special-mission roles across the world. Liberty Defense stock is up 11.42 per cent this week trading at C$0.20 Xtract One Technologies is down 20.63 per cent this week, but up more than 1 per cent on Friday trading at C$0.50 Bombardier stock is down 4.07 per cent this week, but up 0.60 per cent on Friday trading at C$57.02 Beyond the immediate sectors directly impacted by the conflict, such as defense and energy, the ripple effects of geopolitical tensions can reverberate throughout the broader supply chain. Disruptions to shipping lanes, heightened security concerns, and fluctuations in commodity prices can all have downstream effects on industries ranging from manufacturing to retail. There&CloseCurlyQuote;s no fate but what we make for ourselves While the situation in the Middle East remains tense, indications are that tensions could de-escalate in the near term. Early Friday, investors woke to news that Israel had already carried out a military strike inside Iran. During her visit to Israel on Wednesday, Germany&CloseCurlyQuote;s foreign minister tried to ease tensions while calling on everyone to “act prudently and responsibly.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; The volatility stems from a series of unpredictable events that have unfolded over the past months, including the massacre and hostage-taking of Israelis in October 2023. These events sent shockwaves through global markets, highlighting the potential for sudden disruptions to supply chains and geopolitical stability. The invasion and bombing of Gaza, coupled with Yemeni rebel attacks in the Red Sea, have further escalated tensions in the region, raising concerns about the broader implications for global security and trade. For investors, this underscores the importance of adopting a cautious approach and diversifying portfolios to mitigate risk. In the end …. For investors, keeping up with the current geopolitical landscape requires vigilance and adaptability. While the Israel-Iran conflict has rattled markets, it&CloseCurlyQuote;s essential to keep a close eye on developments from a variety of news sources. The potential for de-escalation or further escalation could have profound implications for various sectors and asset classes. A lot of uncertainty is in the air, but staying informed and maintaining a diversified investment portfolio can help mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities that might arise in the face of geopolitical turmoil. Geopolitical risks are inherently unpredictable, and there are no guarantees when it comes to investing in volatile environments. With this in mind, investors should be prepared to react swiftly to changing circumstances and adjust their strategies accordingly.

Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland&CloseCurlyQuote;s projections paint a picture of bold spending initiatives, coupled with strategic revenue generation measures. Let&CloseCurlyQuote;s dissect the key components of the budget and explore their implications for investors. Surging expenditure and deficit One of the standout figures in the budget is Ottawa&CloseCurlyQuote;s plan to spend C$52.9 billion more than initially planned over the next five years. This surge in expenditure comes amid Freeland&CloseCurlyQuote;s projection of a C$40 billion deficit for the current fiscal year. The government&CloseCurlyQuote;s commitment to inject capital into various sectors underscores its efforts to stimulate economic growth and address socio-economic challenges exacerbated by the pandemic. Focus on housing and revenue generation A notable allocation within the budget is the earmarking of C$8.5 billion for housing initiatives, reflecting the government&CloseCurlyQuote;s determination to tackle housing affordability issues. Simultaneously, Freeland has proposed hiking capital gains taxes for high-income individuals and corporations, aiming to generate an estimated C$19 billion in additional revenue. These measures signal a balancing act between social welfare and fiscal responsibility. Escalating national debt servicing costs As spending escalates, so does the cost of servicing the national debt, which has risen substantially by approximately C$2 billion more than initially projected. It is worth noting that the government&CloseCurlyQuote;s expenditure on servicing debt is expected to surpass spending on healthcare this year, highlighting the urgency of managing fiscal policies prudently to ensure long-term economic stability. Changes to capital gains tax Another significant announcement is the federal government&CloseCurlyQuote;s decision to raise the inclusion rate on capital gains, profits received from selling an asset, above C$250,000 realized annually by individuals, as well as on all capital gains realized by corporations and trusts. The proposed higher inclusion rate of two-thirds, up from one-half, is set to take effect June 25, as announced in Budget 2024. This change could have implications for investment strategies and portfolio management. “By increasing the capital gains inclusion rate, we will tackle one of the most regressive elements in Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s tax system,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; the government said in the budget document. The current 50 per cent inclusion rate on capital gains disproportionately benefits the wealthy, who earn relatively more income from capital gains compared with the middle class, the government said in a news conference . Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s investment landscape is undergoing scrutiny and debate as the government proposes a hike to the capital gains tax, drawing opposition from entrepreneurs and investors alike. The move, if implemented, could potentially deter investment in the country, according to critics. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&CloseCurlyQuote;s former finance minister has recently added fuel to the fire by revealing his rejection of the idea to increase the capital gains tax during his tenure. Speaking in a webcast organized by accounting firm KPMG, this disclosure sheds light on internal disagreements within the government regarding fiscal policy. Benjamin Bergen, president of the Council of Canadian Innovators, voiced his own concerns about the potential ramifications of such a tax hike. He argued that the focus on increasing capital gains tax has overshadowed other aspects of the federal budget that could otherwise stimulate excitement within the business community. The opposition to the proposed hike revolves around the fear that it could stifle entrepreneurial activity and investment in Canada. Capital gains tax is a significant factor for investors when making decisions about where to allocate their capital. A higher tax rate on capital gains could disincentivize investment in Canadian ventures, potentially leading to a slowdown in economic growth and innovation. Critics suggest that instead of increasing taxes, the government should focus on creating an environment conducive to entrepreneurship and investment. This includes measures such as reducing regulatory burdens, promoting research and development, and providing incentives for venture capital investment. Amendments to Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s Pension Plan (CPP) In collaboration with provincial counterparts, the federal government has introduced a series of amendments to the CPP. These changes include doubling the death benefit for certain contributors, introducing a partial child benefit for part-time students, extending eligibility for the disabled contributors&CloseCurlyQuote; children&CloseCurlyQuote;s benefit, and adjusting survivor pension eligibility criteria for legally separated couples. Importantly, these amendments are not anticipated to impact contribution rates. Galvanizing the CPP? Meanwhile, Freeland enlisted former central bank governor Stephen Poloz to spearhead efforts to entice Canadian pension funds into bolstering domestic investment. This decision comes at a crucial juncture as the nation seeks to fortify its economic resilience and capitalize on emerging opportunities within its borders. The essence of this initiative lies in the recognition of the pivotal role that pension funds play in shaping the investment landscape. These funds, including behemoths such as the CPP Investment Board, wield substantial capital and possess the potential to catalyze transformative developments across various sectors. By redirecting their focus towards domestic opportunities, Canada aims to amplify its economic momentum and foster sustainable growth. By channeling funds into domestic ventures such as housing development, venture capital, and infrastructure projects such as airports, the government aims to stimulate economic activity and cultivate a conducive environment for innovation and entrepreneurship. These investments not only promise tangible returns but also lay the groundwork for long-term prosperity by enhancing the nation&CloseCurlyQuote;s infrastructure and fostering the growth of nascent industries. Encouraging Canadian pension funds to pivot towards domestic investments aligns with broader objectives of economic sovereignty and resilience. In an increasingly interconnected global economy, the ability to harness domestic capital for critical projects diminishes reliance on external forces and insulates the economy from external shocks. This proactive stance not only bolsters Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s economic autonomy but also fortifies its resilience in the face of evolving geopolitical dynamics and economic uncertainties. However, some prevailing trends have shaped the investment landscape thus far. Over time, Canadian pension funds have exhibited a pronounced inclination towards foreign markets, driven by the pursuit of higher returns and enhanced diversification. While this global outlook has yielded substantial benefits, it has also underscored the need for recalibration to ensure a balanced investment portfolio that encompasses domestic and international opportunities. The recent call by more than 90 business leaders , urging policymakers to revise regulations governing pension fund investments, underscores the widespread recognition of the imperative to incentivize domestic investment. This collective plea reinforces the symbiotic relationship between government policy and private sector participation, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts to unleash Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s full economic potential. As Poloz leads the working group tasked with exploring avenues to entice pension funds into domestic investments, stakeholders across the spectrum are poised to contribute their insights and expertise. Through inclusive dialogue and strategic collaboration, Canada has an opportunity to redefine its investment landscape and chart a course towards sustained prosperity and inclusive growth. Final thoughts As investors navigate through the implications of the federal budget, it&CloseCurlyQuote;s imperative to conduct thorough due diligence to understand how these policy changes might affect their investment portfolios. While increased spending presents opportunities in certain sectors, such as housing and infrastructure, changes to taxation policies necessitate a reassessment of investment strategies. Keeping abreast of developments and seeking professional advice can help investors capitalize on potential opportunities and mitigate risks in the evolving economic landscape. Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s federal budget unveils a mix of ambitious spending initiatives, revenue generation measures, and policy reforms aimed at addressing pressing socio-economic challenges. Investors are urged to delve deeper into the intricacies of the budget and its potential impacts on their investment endeavors.

Thirty-two years later in 1994, Walmart Canada launched with 122 stores. Walmart Canada now has more than 400 stores and distribution centres, employing more than 100,000 people in Canada. Here&CloseCurlyQuote;s a look at Walmart Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s history on its 30th anniversary. From its opening in 1994, the company has impacted the average price of consumable goods in Canada, launched clothing lines, in-store vision centres, superstores, private brands (Our Finest and Home Trends), launched walmart.ca , and among other humanitarian initiatives raised $200 million for Canadian children&CloseCurlyQuote;s hospitals. Walmart massive stock progression As a stock – Walmart has evolved from a brick-and-mortar retailer into a multi-channel player. In addition to its delivery programs the company is invested in online e-commerce platform Flipkart. As a result, Walmart stays competitive with the constantly changing retail ecosystem alongside Amazon and Target. On the cash side, Walmart is well positioned with cash flow growth of 3.5 per cent, and it is expected to report cash flow expansion of 6 per cent in 2025. The company has a market cap of more than $480 billion and since 1984 the stock has increased more than 16,000 per cent. Walmart as a whole continues to offer new opportunities.

An easy way to find candidates for these dislocations is to use your favourite stock screener to search for companies that have been profitable over the past year while underperforming in terms of share price, suggesting potential undervaluation. Using The Globe and Mail&CloseCurlyQuote;s stock screener , I set parameters for price-to-earnings from 0.1 to 10, market capitalization to C$1 billion and under, and 52-week stock performance beginning from -90 per cent, and generated a list of 161 companies that have achieved the attractive feat of making money while suffering a severe drop in share price. Here are three stocks from the list that I found to be particularly compelling: Titan Medical Titan Medical , market capitalization C$6.86 million, is a medical technology company holding a patent portfolio related to enhancing robotic assisted surgery. The company is working towards completing a merger agreement with Conavi Medical , which designs, manufactures, and markets imaging technologies to guide minimally invasive cardiovascular procedures. Conavi&CloseCurlyQuote;s patented Novasight Hybrid System is the first to combine intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography to enable simultaneous and co-registered imaging of coronary arteries. Titan made US$6.95 million in net income in 2023, marking its first profitable year over the past five. Despite producing more cash than it spent, Titan Medical (TSX:TMD) has given back 73.91 per cent year-over-year. Canacol Energy Our next microcap value stock pick, Canacol Energy , market capitalization C$156.57 million, is a Colombian natural gas exploration and production company sitting on a generational resource. The company holds 295 billion cubic feet equivalent (bcfe) of 1P gas reserves valued at US$776 million in the ground, and 607 bcfe of 2P reserves valued at US$1.3 billion in the ground, in addition to more than 20.5 trillion in unrisked prospective resources. Management&CloseCurlyQuote;s extraction strategy has raked in cash over the past five years, generating US$86.24 million in net income in 2023, US$147.27 million in 2022, US$15.18 million in 2021, and US$34.25 million in 2019, with a lone blip of -US$4.74 million in 2020 attributable to the COVID pandemic. Despite the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s distinguished financial performance, Canacol stock (TSX:CNE) has given back 55.69 per cent year-over-year, and 77.39 per cent since 2019. CanadaBis Capital Our final microcap value stock pick is CanadaBis Capital , market capitalization C$11.75 million, a vertically integrated cannabis company focused on large-scale growth from cultivation to retail. The company offers exposure to: Stigma Grow, a subsidiary that operates a 66,000 square-foot cultivation and processing facility in Red Deer, Alberta Full Spectrum Labs, a cannabis extraction, product development and R&D company working to capitalize on the legal extracts market INDICAtive Collection, a cannabis retail boutique located in Red Deer This diversified cannabis company posted C$4.4 million in net income in fiscal 2023, C$0.61 million in fiscal 2022, and C$0.71 million and C$0.11 million in Q1 and Q2 of fiscal 2024, respectively, in addition to having grown revenue by more than five times from C$4.43 million in 2020 to C$22.22 million in 2023. Paying no mind to these consistent cash-flowing operations, the market has punished CanadaBis stock (TSXV:CANB) and its shareholders with a 59.52 per cent loss year-over-year, and an 81.52 per cent loss since 2019. Parting proviso Before you invest in one of the picks above, or into other stocks that catch your fancy from the screener, make sure to run them through your personal due diligence process to ensure they align with your financial goals, risk tolerance and current financial situation. While recent profitability and a discounted stock price make for an enticing green flag towards a prospective allocation, the combination alone isn&CloseCurlyQuote;t sufficient to merit an investment.

{"source_name": "Stockhouse Canada", "title": "Three top mining stocks from exploration to production", "title_link": "https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2024/04/12/three-top-mining-stocks-from-exploration-to-production", "author": " Trevor Abes ", "Description": "When it comes to picking top mining stocks, quality is the name of the game, regardless of their operational focus on exploration, development or production. This is because investors need hard numbers to evaluate management performance, assign a probability to their outlooks, and ultimately justify ownership of a stock over the long term. Any talk of prospectivity without evidence merely suggests the latest casualty among the less than 1 in 10,000 projects that goes on to become a mine, according to the Ontario Mining Association . It&CloseCurlyQuote;s only by building positions in assets with demonstrated potential, attached to in-demand commodities, that investors can weather the mining industry&CloseCurlyQuote;s extreme volatility and come out the other side with more cash in their pockets. Chakana Copper When it comes to junior mining stocks, few are more attractive than Chakana Copper (TSXV:PERU) , whose Soledad project in Peru&CloseCurlyQuote;s mining-friendly Ancash province offers exposure to an inferred resource of 130 million pounds of copper, 191,000 ounces of gold and 11.7 million ounces of silver. These numbers stem from testing only 28 out of 154 defined targets, with a fully funded 3,000-metre drill program beginning earlier this month, positioning the company for positive long-term news flow as it explores its untapped land package. With copper expected to experience a steepening deficit well into the 2030s as the electric vehicle industry ramps up to compete with combustion engines, investors may want to take advantage of the stock&CloseCurlyQuote;s 70.73 per cent loss since 2019 before it re-rates on the back of rising copper prices , which are testing the 10-year high. David Kelley, Chakana Copper&CloseCurlyQuote;s president and chief executive officer, joined Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Brieanna McCutcheon to speak about the mineral explorer&CloseCurlyQuote;s ongoing 2024 drilling program. Watch the interview here . Discovery Silver When it comes to development-focused mining stocks, Discovery Silver (TSX:DSV) should be towards the top of your due diligence list, thanks to its Cordero project in Mexico ranking as one of the largest undeveloped silver resources in the world. The project, acquired in 2019 and in the mining-friendly state of Chihuahua, boasts a net present value (5 per cent) of US$1.2 billion, rising to more than US$2 billion in year 4, and low all-in sustaining costs (AISC) per ounce of silver equivalent under US$13.50 over a 19-year mine life, with a 2022 feasibility study delineating production of 259 million ounces of silver, 2.6 billion pounds of lead and 4.4 billion pounds of zinc over the life of mine. Backed by significant expansion opportunities (slide 12), a commodity Eric Sprott sees almost 10x-ing from current prices to US$200 , and the stock&CloseCurlyQuote;s 65 per cent fall from its five-year high, potential investors should let their assessment of management dictate whether the world-class Cordero&CloseCurlyQuote;s journey through permitting, construction and production is worth the wait. Judging by Discovery&CloseCurlyQuote;s team of industry stalwarts , led by CEO Tony Makuch, a former president and CEO of Kirkland Lake Gold, now feels like a propitious time to build a position. Makuch recently spoke with Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Ryan Dhillon about Discovery Silver&CloseCurlyQuote;s Q4 2023 and full-year 2023 financial results. Watch the interview here . Mandalay Resources Among the select group of miners that make it to production, Mandalay Resources (TSX:MND) is notable for its attractive combination of small capitalization, at C$203.97 million as of Thursday, a production track record spanning more than a decade, and numerous expansion opportunities setting it up to generate significant long-term shareholder value. Mandalay&CloseCurlyQuote;s Björkdal gold mine in Sweden and Costerfield gold-antimony mine in Australia have established combined average run-rate production between 80,000-100,000 ounces of gold equivalent per year going back a decade, with AISC comfortably below US$1,500 per ounce providing a healthy margin to the spot price of US$2,374.30 as of 1:57 pm ET Thursday. In conjunction with consistent production, the company has increased Björkdal&CloseCurlyQuote;s reserve life to nine years as of April 2024, while maintaining approximately two to five years of reserve life at Costerfield since 2012. Propelled by gold flirting with all-time-highs, the robust infrastructure of its leading jurisdictions, and a management team steeped in gold mining experience across small and large-cap companies, Mandalay has generated positive net income for four consecutive years, including US$9.31 million in 2020, US$54.88 million in 2021, US$23.51 million in 2022 and US$7.86 million in 2023, while turning positive on a net debt-to-cash basis in Q1 2024. Mandalay stock has tracked growing profitability, adding 109.52 per cent since 2019, but still remains down by 81.5 per cent compared with its 10-year high, signalling it has plenty of room left to run as the gold producer explores its more than 14,000-hectare land package.

The decision coincides with core inflation and wage growth continuing to cool, and the unemployment rate in March hitting 6.1 per cent , which is up by 1 per cent year-over-year, marking the first time the rate rose above 6 per cent in more than two years. These signals that high borrowing costs are working as intended have been offset by record population gains outpacing employment growth, with those aged 15 and up rising by 91,000 in March. Analysts see the BoC&CloseCurlyQuote;s first rate cut coming in June or July, and they will be parsing through Wednesday&CloseCurlyQuote;s interest rate announcement and monetary policy report for language indicative of dovishness ahead. The Consumer Price Index has been on a steep downward path from 8.1 per cent in June 2022 to 2.8 per cent in February 2024, falling within the BoC&CloseCurlyQuote;s target range of 1-3 per cent for the first time since March 2021. That said, this cut-friendly trajectory could find itself derailed because of numerous factors: The United States added 303,000 jobs in March, well beyond estimates as low as 150,000, while its unemployment rate fell slightly to 3.8 per cent, signaling economic strength that might lift Canada along with it Oil has shown resiliency, rising from US$69.50 per barrel in December 2023 to US$85.83 as of 8:35 am ET, because of expectations of economic growth in the U.S. and China, and attacks on Russian refineries Canada beat the BoC&CloseCurlyQuote;s expectation of zero growth for Q4 2023 by a full percentage point Figures for Q1 2024 point to further growth of 3.5 per cent, well ahead of the BoC&CloseCurlyQuote;s estimate of 0.5 per cent Given the present mix of economic resiliency and weakening inflation, many investors are likely neutral on whether risk-on or risk-off holdings are more appropriate to overweight. It&CloseCurlyQuote;s reasonable to suppose that this dynamic has led to a cross-sector undervaluation of stocks viewed as too risky to consider, despite their quality assets, that are poised to outperform once borrowing conditions normalize. Prospective areas for due diligence under this thesis include junior mining , where stocks have been lagging target commodities for the past few years; healthcare , where pre-revenue drug and technology developers have been pummeled despite their revolutionary potential; and brands with leading market share masked by their growth-focused financials, including Tilray, Canopy Growth, PyroGenesis, Jackpot Digital and Else Nutrition.

As we enter April, investors in Pulsar Helium Inc. (TSXV:PLSR) eagerly await several key developments that could significantly impact the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s trajectory in the helium market. Pulsar Helium, a pioneering force in the extraction of primary helium assets, is poised to achieve important milestones that underscore its commitment to meeting the growing global demand for this essential element. Background on Pulsar Helium and the Topaz Project Pulsar Helium is at the forefront of primary helium extraction in North America, with its flagship project, Topaz, situated in Minnesota. The company&CloseCurlyQuote;s focus on domestically sourced primary helium is particularly timely, given the increasing importance of clean energy technologies and the global shift towards sustainability. A recent highlight for Pulsar Helium was the presence of a film crew on-site, documenting the progress of the Topaz Project as part of a global health campaign. This initiative is significant not only for showcasing the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s endeavors but also for raising awareness about the critical role of domestically sourced primary helium in advancing technology and healthcare services. (For full video click here.) Why the documentary matters The documentary serves as a testament to Pulsar&CloseCurlyQuote;s pioneering efforts as it positions itself as the most promising privately owned helium exploration company in North America. With helium listed as a critical resource in Canada and the E.U., the importance of securing a reliable source of primary helium cannot be overstated. From electronic manufacturing to life-saving medical applications like MRI scanners, helium plays a vital role in various sectors, making sustainable extraction methods imperative. (Source: Pulsar Helium Inc.) Since this documentary was filmed, the team has identified helium contents of up to 13.8 per cent at Topaz, making it one of the highest-grade discoveries in history. The company now works to further operations at the project, with the intention of realizing its potential for production. Recent milestones and analytical results March brought exciting news for Pulsar Helium, as the company announced analytical laboratory results for gas samples from the Jetstream #1 appraisal well at the project. The well, reaching a total depth of 671 metres, revealed concentrations of up to 13.8 percent helium, as measured by the on-site quadrupole mass spectrometre. This significant discovery underscores the immense potential of the Topaz Project and positions Pulsar Helium as a major player in North America&CloseCurlyQuote;s helium market.

(Planview showing the positions of the reported boreholes. Source: Koryx Copper Inc.) About the Haib copper deposit The Haib copper deposit, approximately 40 kilometres from the southern boundary of Namibia, is a substantial copper / molybdenum (Mo) resource covering an expansive 370 square km area. With more than 70,000 metres of historical drilling and several metallurgical test work programs conducted over the years, the project boasts a solid foundation for future development. Delving into the geological history of the area, the Haib copper deposit stands as one of the oldest deposits globally, dating back approximately 1.8 billion years (Archean). Over the millennia, it has undergone various geological transformations, including shearing and faulting events that have contributed to the concentration of copper and molybdenum. Notably, numerous mineralized structures have been identified in the Pit1 area (see map above), further underscoring the geological richness of the region.

Boasting a stock value up just over 30 per cent since this time last month, Koryx Copper Inc. presents a compelling investment opportunity, buoyed by the continued success of its drilling program at the Haib copper project. With robust assay results reinforcing the project&CloseCurlyQuote;s resource potential and a favourable trajectory for copper prices in the foreseeable future, investors are encouraged to conduct further due diligence into the company.

{"source_name": "Stockhouse Canada", "title": "How to invest in ChatGPT", "title_link": "https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2024/04/08/how-to-invest-chatgpt", "author": "Jocelyn Aspa", "Description": "All the rage since it officially launched in November 2022, ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) software program that uses natural language processing to create humanlike dialogue. In the chatbox, users provide details that allow the model to respond to questions and write content that includes everything from articles and social media posts to emails. The platform was created and launched by OpenAI , an AI research company founded in December 2015. Broadly speaking, the company has a goal of developing and directing AI that benefits humanity, and ChatGPT has certainly been integral to the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s goals. Because the platform has grown exponentially since its launch, the question – which has been on every investor&CloseCurlyQuote;s mind – is, how can someone invest in ChatGPT ? Before we answer that question, we&CloseCurlyQuote;ll first provide an overview of what ChatGPT does, the platform&CloseCurlyQuote;s growth, and, of course, how investors can invest in ChatGPT. What is ChatGPT? The technology behind ChatGPT isn&CloseCurlyQuote;t necessarily new and is quite similar to automated chat services on almost any website you can think of that offers customer service. Think of the virtual chat assistants you use for help with online accounts or orders placed from an online shopping store. The “GPT&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; portion means generative pre-trained transformer, which is essentially a language model and a framework for generative AI that forms responses and processes requests. In other words, ChatGPT can also be thought of as similar to Google, although it generates far more in-depth and elaborative responses. What makes it stand out from other AI chatbots is that it provides a humanlike feedback response and can answer follow-up questions as well as provide additional detail and feedback. With that in mind, ChatGPT can be used for almost anything you can think of, including: Creating social media content : this includes platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and LinkedIn. By providing ChatGPT with a topic, target audience, and the tone of the message, ChatGPT can generate content applicable to each platform Summarizing and paraphrasing content : including research papers, articles, emails and more. While not ideal for writing all content, ChatGPT can help users with difficult content and break it down to explain in layman&CloseCurlyQuote;s terms in a way that is understandable and kept within the same tone SEO optimization: this is particularly useful for companies that want to rank their websites higher in Google&CloseCurlyQuote;s rankings. ChatGPT can offer suggestions on titles and meta descriptions that will improve search rankings. Of course, ChatGPT has a wide range of other use cases, but it&CloseCurlyQuote;s safe to say its possibilities are endless. The growth of ChatGPT After the platform&CloseCurlyQuote;s hard launch in November 2022, Chat GPT gained more than 1 million users in its first five days alone. Image credit: Exploding Topics According to Reuters , the platform reached 100 million monthly active users in January 2023, just two months after its official launch. The outfit credited a study from UBS that stated this made ChatGPT the fastest-growing consumer application of all time. Fast forward to March 2024 and it is estimated that ChatGPT now has roughly 180 million users, while 100 million of them remain active. In a report by Demand Sage , it is projected that ChatGPT will generate roughly $1 billion in revenue in 2024, up from its projected $200 million in 2023. Image credit: Riori Data In terms of the overarching chatbot market, it is anticipated it will reach a valuation of he a valuation of $7.01 billion in 2024, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 24.32 per per cent to $20.81 billion by 2029. How to invest in ChatGPT As it currently stands, no way exists to invest in ChatGPT shares because its creator, OpenAI, is not a publicly traded company. With that in mind, however, people do have ways to invest in ChatGPT indirectly – notably, through two key companies. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Microsoft and OpenAI have a strategic partnership in place and moved to extend their partnership in January 2023 . Microsoft is one of the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s largest vendors of computer software; hardware for computer, mobile and gaming systems; and cloud services In an announcement from 2023, Microsoft stated it had entered the third phase of its long-term partnership with OpenAI to “accelerate AI breakthroughs to ensure these benefits are broadly shared with the world.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; “We formed our partnership with OpenAI around a shared ambition to responsibly advance cutting-edge AI research and democratize AI as a new technology platform,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, said in a news release. “In this next phase of our partnership, developers and organizations across industries will have access to the best AI infrastructure, models, and toolchain with Azure to build and run their applications.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Perion Network (NASDAQ:PERI) Perion Network is an Israeli-American-led company that provides digital advertising products and services. The company particularly operates across the three digital advertising segments, including ad search, social media and display/video/CTV. Investors can get exposure to ChatGPT through Perion Network thanks to Perion&CloseCurlyQuote;s strategic partnership with Microsoft&CloseCurlyQuote;s Bing search engine, which has been rolled out with a new version powered by ChatGPT. While Microsoft and Perion Network might be an investor&CloseCurlyQuote;s only gateway into ChatGPT itself, investors can invest in other companies with chatbot technologies. IBM (NYSE:IBM) Also known as International Business Machines, IBM is a provider of hybrid cloud and AI. Its segments include software; consulting; and infrastructure and financing. Under its software segment are its hybrid platform and solutions to help clients operate, manage and optimize IT resources within hybrid, multi-cloud environments. Through its consulting segment, IBM provides business transformation, technology consulting and application operations. Meanwhile, its infrastructure segment focuses on hybrid infrastructure and infrastructure support, while its financing segment focuses on client financing and commercial financing. Notably, IBM&CloseCurlyQuote;s chatbot service is watsonx, which is an AI platform for building and tuning foundation models, generative AI and machine learning systems. The platform includes a studio, data store and governance toolkit. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. is a holding company with a wide range of segments, including Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets. Under Google Services are products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps, Google Play, Search and YouTube. The Google Cloud segment includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. The Other Bets segment focuses on the sale of healthcare-related services and Internet services, while Google Cloud provides enterprise-ready cloud services, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. Notably, the Google Cloud Platform provides cybersecurity, databases, analytics, and a range of AI offerings. Alphabet launched Bard in February 2023, which is a multi-language AI model powered by Google&CloseCurlyQuote;s language model LaMDA . According to a post from Alphabet: Bard seeks to combine the breadth of the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s knowledge with the power, intelligence and creativity of our large language models. It draws on information from the web to provide fresh, high-quality responses. Bard can be an outlet for creativity, and a launchpad for curiosity, helping you to explain new discoveries from NASA&CloseCurlyQuote;s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old, or learn more about the best strikers in football right now, and then get drills to build your skills. If investors are looking for an alternative to ChatGPT – and because ChatGPT can&CloseCurlyQuote;t be directly invested into – Bard, and Alphabet, might be the closest thing to it. Exchange-traded funds Another way to get exposure to ChatGPT is through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are funds traded on a stock exchange the same way shares of a company are. In particular, investors can invest in the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:CHAT) , which is the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s first Generative AI ETF. CHAT began trading in May 2023 and tracks a portfolio of companies actively involved in Generative AI. As it currently stands it has 49 holdings in its portfolio, with some of its top holdings including: NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Microsoft Alphabet Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) The bottom line It goes without saying that ChatGPT and generative AI are transforming technology and the way we live. Because the technology and its use cases are still relatively new, there will be hiccups along the way, and tons of new entrants will enter the market looking to capitalize on the technology&CloseCurlyQuote;s popularity.

On a global scale, the PDT market was estimated to be valued at $US 4.5 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $8.9 billion by 2031, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.9 per cent over nine years. Contributing to the market&CloseCurlyQuote;s growth is an increase in clinical studies that demonstrate PDT&CloseCurlyQuote;s safety and above all effectiveness in treating medical conditions, such as cancer. PDT is minimally invasive; therefore, reduces the pain and complications associated with more invasive therapies, such as surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. To solidify its lead role in the PDT space, Theralase&circledR; has recently announced that it has been granted a Canadian patent for a new cancer vaccine that is able to program the patient&CloseCurlyQuote;s immune system to destroy their cancer. Theralase&circledR; granted Canadian vaccine patent In its latest news release, Theralase&circledR; revealed that the patent will protect the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s PDC technology in treating patients with a cancer vaccine. The methodology is quite simple and elegant, a sample of the patient&CloseCurlyQuote;s cancer is obtained, whether solid or blood-based)and subsequently treated with Theralase&circledR;&CloseCurlyQuote;s PDC that is then activated with either light or X-rays. The wholly-inactivated cancer, with antigens intact, is then injected back into the patient intravenously with the antigens now programming the patient&CloseCurlyQuote;s immune systems to recognize, attack and destroy the designated cancer. “The possibilities and opportunities of our PDC technology continue to grow at a rapid pace,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Roger DuMoulin-White, President and CEO of Theralase&circledR; said in a statement. “The company plans to become properly financed this year through various equity and debt instruments to allow the company the opportunity to commence new clinical studies focused on the destruction of both solid-core and liquid cancers.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Arkady Mandel, chief scientific officer of Theralase&circledR; and the patent&CloseCurlyQuote;s inventor, explained, “The patent represents an opportunity to treat patients with blood-related cancers that can be difficult, if not impossible, to treat.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; “While the company has been historically focused on treating solid-core tumours such as bladder, brain and lung cancers,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Mandel stated. “This patent opens the opportunity for Theralase&circledR; to treat liquid cancers.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Liquid cancer treatment market growth Generally known as blood-based cancers, liquid cancers are most formally known as leukemia, myeloma and lymphoma and start in the bone marrow, where blood is produced. Broadly speaking, the global blood cancer drug market is expected to reach a valuation of $108 billion by 2031, with the increasing prevalence of blood cancer driving that growth. Internationally, approximately 474,519 new cases of leukemia were reported in 2020, with the global leukemia treatment market expected to reach $27.78 billion by 2027. Among the several types of leukemia, some occur most often in children, while others most often in adults. Acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia most often occur in adults, while acute lymphocytic leukemia occurs in all age groups. The myeloma treatment market is expected to reach $USD 31 billion by 2026 growing at a CAGR of 6 per cent. Multiple myeloma is a rare form of cancer and is one of the types of blood cancer that accounts for a large prevalence of cancer cases, worldwide. As a result, this is leading to a higher number of diagnoses in patients; thus, gaining the attention of major market pharmaceutical players. When it comes to the lymphoma market, its treatment size is expected to reach $13.1 billion by 2026. Lymphoma is one of the most common forms of blood cancer, which means its market potential is significant. As such, new drug candidates are being evaluated in clinical studies to treat several forms of lymphoma. Theralase&circledR; future outlook Theralase&circledR; notched a U.S. patent in October 2022, protecting the same technology as its newly acquired patent in Canada, while a European Union patent is currently pending. In its pipeline, the company is conducting a late-stage Phase II registration clinical study for bladder cancer, expected to be completed by 2026. Theralase&circledR; expects to launch a Phase Ib clinical study for brain cancer and lung cancer in 2024, pending the completion of a GLP toxicology analysis. Theralase&circledR; investment corner Thanks to its robust pipeline, Theralase&circledR; has the potential to address a much-needed market with its next standard of care treatments for solid tumours, as well as blood-based cancers. As the company moves forward with clinical studies into 2024 and beyond, investors will no doubt be keenly watching how the company disrupts the pharmaceutical market.

Last week, silver experienced a substantial bullish rally, marking a significant milestone by touching a 2.5-year high against every major currency. Silver prices have climbed more than 90 per cent in the past five years and was valued at more than US$28/oz on Wednesday. This surge is indicative of the current strength in the market of precious metals, which have shown resilience even with a perceived risk-on environment. Silver spot price – April 2021 to April 2024. Investors need to understand the long relationship between silver and other asset classes. Contrary to popular belief, silver has historically shown a positive correlation with the stock market and other risky assets. While often considered a hedge against market downturns, silver&CloseCurlyQuote;s movements are not always inversely related to equities. Many analysts currently view silver as an attractive investment opportunity. However, investors should exercise caution, especially if they already hold positions in gold. Silver and gold have a strong positive correlation, meaning that movements in one often influence the other. Diversifying investments and managing overall risk exposure is prudent in such scenarios. Outlook on the value of silver (Stock photo) The recent surge in silver prices reflects not only its intrinsic value but also investor sentiment and market dynamics. As global economic uncertainties persist, precious metals like silver are likely to remain in demand as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. On top of this, increasing industrial usage of silver in sectors like electronics, solar panels, and healthcare further bolsters its long-term value proposition. Analyst David Morgan with Silver-Investor.com spoke to Commodity Culture recently and forecast this price rally to go beyond US$30/oz. (Source: Silver North Resources Ltd.)

{"source_name": "Stockhouse Canada", "title": "How to invest in index funds: A guide for active investors", "title_link": "https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2024/04/04/how-to-invest-index-funds-a-guide-for-active-investors", "author": " Trevor Abes ", "Description": "Index funds, or passive investing, is an increasingly popular way to access the stock market with less effort, and considerably more profits, than an active approach where stocks are chosen based on their likelihood to outperform. 1. What are index funds? Index funds invest in a group or index of stocks, bonds, or other assets, meant to represent a certain sector, country or section of the world. Instead of picking the most attractive stocks and resigning themselves to underperforming the global market over the long term, as shown in a recent report by Index Fund Advisors , investors can buy a low-fee index fund that owns the entire market and spend the saved time on more productive activities. According to an article by Meb Faber, a popular fund manager and financial podcaster, this simple switch has yielded 5 per cent above inflation per year from 1900 to 2018. For perspective, Canadian inflation averaged 3.15 per cent from 1915 until 2024, while global inflation has averaged between 3 and 5 per cent since 2000. These figures make it reasonable to expect long-term global stock index fund returns in the vicinity of 8 per cent per year. 2. How do index funds compare to active investing? Research : Active investors will often spend hours combing through balance sheets and income statements, as well as evaluating products and services with the strongest demand, before choosing a stock whose underlying operations seem likely to do better than the global market, or at least the national markets it trades in. Index investors, on the other hand, only need to buy one fund to capture the entire universe of stocks their active counterparts must spend their days parsing through. Performance : According to data from the S&P Indices Versus Active (SPIVA) report , only 3.37 per cent of active Canadian investment funds outperformed the S&P/TSX Composite Index over the past decade. This means 97 out of 100 professional Canadian investors failed to pick stocks that earned more than simply owning the entire Canadian stock market, which index funds allow you to do. Fees : The mammoth discrepancy between passive and active performance is mostly because of index funds&CloseCurlyQuote; low fees, which can be as low as 0.05 per cent for a fund that tracks the TSX. Active funds, for their part, rely more heavily on research and frequent trading, which entail an average annual fee up to 30 times higher at about 1.5 per cent. Over an investing lifetime, this fee differential can result in hundreds of thousands of dollars being diverted into your investment provider&CloseCurlyQuote;s pockets, instead of yours. 3. What kind of index funds can you buy? Stock index funds come in all shapes and sizes, from those that track individual market sectors, like energy or technology, to those that track national markets like Canada or the United States, to those that own tens of thousands of stocks and track the entire global market. You can also invest in indexes that focus on bonds, precious metals, real estate and even cryptocurrency. Most long-term index investors choose to own one fund that tracks the global stock market, such as Vanguard&CloseCurlyQuote;s VEQT or Blackrock&CloseCurlyQuote;s XWD , or a series of funds that track their national stock market, the United States, developed international markets and emerging markets, for added flexibility to more accurately achieve their desired asset allocation. Your asset allocation is simply the percentage of stocks, bonds and other assets that best position you to meet your financial goals, while remaining in line with your risk tolerance and financial situation. If you&CloseCurlyQuote;re investing for a goal within the next one to five years, you should favour less volatile investments such as bonds, savings accounts and guaranteed investment certificates to ensure your funds are there when you need them. If your goal is further out than that, a good rule of thumb is to add a 5 per cent stock allocation for every year beyond five years that your goal extends. 4. Who are the best index fund providers? Canadians can look to familiar names in the realm of finance for their index funds, each of which boasts a multi-generational track record of safe and reliable asset custody. These include: Vanguard , the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s second-largest investment manager at US$7.25 trillion as of March 2023, according to Statista, and the inventor of the first publicly available index fund in the 1970s Blackrock , the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s largest investment manager at US$9.43 trillion as of March 2023 Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s Big Six banks , listed here in order of market capitalization: Royal Bank of Canada, TD, Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada While there will be stark differences among the types of index funds these institutions provide, those that track broad markets, like entire countries, groupings of countries, or the entire world, will be similar enough in construction and annual fee to produce approximately the same returns over the long term. Just make sure to buy index funds in an ETF or exchange-traded fund wrapper, which offers lower fees and better tax efficiency compared with legacy mutual fund wrappers. 5. How should you build your index fund portfolio? Whether you invest in one or a handful of index funds, research from Morningstar suggests that you should be prepared to hold stocks for at least two decades to give yourself the best chance at satisfactory returns. With that timeframe in mind, you should then consider which account to hold your index funds in: A tax-free savings account allows you to keep all of your dividends and capital appreciation without having to pay taxes, subject to yearly contribution limits. A registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) allows you to defer taxes on investment gains, again subject to yearly contribution limits, as well as deduct every dollar contributed from your taxable income for the year, or any subsequent year until you turn 71. If you have to use funds from your RRSP, they will be taxed at your income tax rate at the time of withdrawal. A non-registered brokerage account , which commonly comes into play after investors run out of RRSP and TFSA room, requires you to pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in the year you receive them. Account holders can offset capital gains with capital losses in any of the three preceding years or in any future year. Once you&CloseCurlyQuote;ve identified the investment account best aligned with your financial goals, you can go ahead and buy units of your index fund(s) in line with your asset allocation, just like you would with an individual stock. Simply type in the ticker code, specify the number of desired shares, and set a limit price per share at or one-to-two cents above the current ask price to ensure your order is filled. You can also select a market order to pay whatever price the shares are trading for, which may change from second to second contingent on that day&CloseCurlyQuote;s volatility. As you make monthly or bi-weekly contributions, remember to regularly rebalance your portfolio , should any assets grow beyond a percentage you&CloseCurlyQuote;re comfortable holding. 6. Can active and passive investing coexist? Even though index funds have trounced active funds in Canada and across the world over the past decade, and in many cases, the decade before that, it&CloseCurlyQuote;s only fair to play devil&CloseCurlyQuote;s advocate and say plenty of stocks do better than their national markets. And while it certainly takes more work to identify them compared with buying into a diversified portfolio of index funds, it is far from impossible for investors who know what green flags to look for: such as experienced management, expanding market share, improving asset quality, brand power and growing profits. Take a look at Founders Metals (TSXV:FDR) , Dynacor Group (TSX:DNG) and Alphamin Resources (TSXV:AFM) for three small-cap examples with recent Stockhouse coverage, that have beaten the TSX by 5x, 3.5x and 8x over the past five years, respectively. More familiar names in the large-cap space, such as Enbridge (TSX:ENB) , Brookfield Asset Management (TSX:BM) and Shopify (TSX:SHOP) have done even better, lapping the TSX by more than 20x-40x going back to the mid-1990s. Individual stock pickers also have distinct advantages compared with professional managers when it comes to making money in the markets. These include the ability to build positions in micro-cap and small-cap stocks that are too small for active funds, which may have hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars to allocate, and the ability to hold prospective stocks through long periods of volatility without suffering from the career risk entailed by managing other people&CloseCurlyQuote;s money. If we combine these advantages with a solid due diligence process, there is no reason why an active investor shouldn&CloseCurlyQuote;t be able to yield a decent return. Will this return be higher than a comparable index fund over an investment lifetime? The data is clear that the answer is probably not. This is why it&CloseCurlyQuote;s reasonable for investors who can&CloseCurlyQuote;t resist the allure of active strategies to own a core percentage of their portfolio in index funds, ensuring an average long-term return close to the global market, while pursuing gains above that average with satellite positions in single stocks. In this way, Stockhouse readers can find a balance between slow-and-steady passive investing, and shooting for the moon with active stock picks, on the road to funding their financial goals.

Electric vehicles (EVs) alone require up to four times more copper than gasoline-powered vehicles for everything from motors to batteries to charging infrastructure. This includes approximately 83 kg per battery-based EV, 59 kg for a plug-in hybrid EV, and 369 kg for a battery electric bus. In addition to EV demand, the rising need for copper in solar, wind, bioenergy and electricity networks can require up to 12 times more copper than traditional energy systems, with exponential demand growth expected through 2050. According to estimates by Energy Minute , copper demand through 2050 will require twice the amount of copper the world has produced over the past 3,000 years. BloombergNEF , for its part, sees demand for refined copper growing by 53 per cent by 2040, with supply climbing by only 16 per cent. A separate study by Wood Mackenzie takes us through the present decade, estimating that, by 2030, the world will be short by about 6 million tonnes of copper to keep pace with net-zero goals. This dynamic sets the stage for investors to capitalize on prospective junior copper stocks garnering attention in the hot copper M&A market , as major players seek to expand production capacity to better meet global demand. Building the next world-class copper district Enter Max Resource (TSXV:MAX) , market capitalization C$19.36 million, a junior miner exploring its 100-per-cent-owned CESAR copper-silver project in mining-friendly northeastern Colombia. CESAR sits along the Andean belt , the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s largest producing copper belt, which has the potential to yield billions of pounds of copper and hundreds of millions of ounces of silver over the coming decades. Fortified by ready access to infrastructure thanks to the nearby presence of Chevron oil and gas operations and Glencore&CloseCurlyQuote;s Cerrejon , the largest coal mine in Latin America, CESAR is positioned to further propel Colombia&CloseCurlyQuote;s leadership position in the energy transition , and 7x growth in copper production from 2011 to 2022, with its multitude of high-grade results and clear momentum towards identifying a world-class resource. (Source: Max Resource) The CESAR project lies along the richly mineralized 220-kilometre-long Cesar Basin. It&CloseCurlyQuote;s the only unexplored sedimentary copper-silver basin in the world, despite vast porphyry copper-molybdenum-gold and related vein systems in its upper portion, and sediment-hosted copper-silver deposits in its lower portion. Sedimentary copper deposits are found in ocean basins, where porous seabed materials provide access to copper and other minerals nestled in layers of rock. Copper porphyry deposits, for their part, are formed during the cooling of molten-rock magma, which leads to zones of dissolved metals, such as copper, molybdenum, gold, tin, zinc and lead. Max&CloseCurlyQuote;s sampling, surveying and mapping to date make a strong case for CESAR hosting economical copper-silver mineralization over a large area, as highlighted by three 100 per-cent-owned mineralized districts within a 120 km by 20 km zone , backed by: 1,125 surface rock samples returning values greater than 1 per cent copper , with average grades of 3.5 per cent copper and 36 g/t silver 28 targets being evaluated for drill testing 20 mining concessions spanning more than 188 square km across a land package in excess of 1,000 square km Let&CloseCurlyQuote;s look further into these three districts underpinning Max&CloseCurlyQuote;s first-mover advantage in the Cesar Basin, beginning with the most prospective, to understand the robust upside shareholders are positioned to reap. The AM discovery The AM discovery, reported in January 2020 , is a 32-km-long Kupferschiefer-type copper system featuring 15 mining concessions covering 114 square km and 14 highly prospective targets with mineralization beginning at surface. Highlight samples to date in the property&CloseCurlyQuote;s sedimentary red bed sequences include 34.4 per cent copper and 305 g/t silver. The Kupferschiefer district is the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s largest silver producer and Europe&CloseCurlyQuote;s largest copper resource, generating 3 metric tonnes of copper in 2018 and 40 million ounces of silver in 2019 from an ore body grading 1.49 per cent copper and 48.6 g/t silver starting 500 metres below surface. (Source: Max Resource) AM, for its part, backs up its district-scale prospects with a lengthy history of exploration milestones, including: Two scout drill holes reported in April 2023 confirming the continuity of stratiform mineralization at depth . The May 2023 discovery of the AM-7 target , a significant copper-silver system that ranges from 0.3-3.8 m in width, extends more than 2 km along strike, and is open in all directions. Subsequent channel samples reported in June feature high grades, including nine samples of at least 4 per cent copper and 24 samples of at least 10 g/t silver, with highs of 18.3 per cent copper and 138 g/t silver. A high-resolution airborne magnetic and radiometric survey over the entire AM district initiated in August 2023, the first in the history of the Cesar Basin, to develop and refine drill targets. The AM-08 discovery , just 7 km southeast of AM-07, reported in September 2023, featuring a significant mineralized outcrop spanning 10 m in width before disappearing underground. AM-08 went on to yield high-grade rock chip channel samples in November 2023, including 2.6 per cent copper and 58 g/t silver over 15 m , including 3.5 per cent copper and 77 g/t silver over 10 m. The discovery of targets AM-09 through AM-12 in October 2023 based on preliminary airborne magnetic and radiometric survey data, demonstrating a reliable correlation between known mineralization and the survey. The strength of the data at AM led management to extend the survey to cover CESAR&CloseCurlyQuote;s other two main districts, Conejo and URU – which we&CloseCurlyQuote;ll discuss later on – with eyes on honing in on new targets and those meriting follow-up exploration. The identification of five mineralized outcrops covering 1,000 square m, collectively known as AM-14 , in February 2024, including exposure up to 285 m along strike and up to 4 m thick, and strong evidence of 1.5 km of mineralized continuity with AM-07. The junior copper stock discovered two more mineralized outcrops on AM-14 in February, showing the target to reside along a 15-km corridor of high-grade copper-silver mineralization, including highlight grades of 24.8 per cent copper and 230 g/t silver. High-grade rock chip assays reported in March 2024 reached as high as 2.2 per cent copper and 12.8 g/t silver over 5.2 m, and 4.8 per cent copper and 53.6 g/t silver over 2.2 m, confirming Kupferschiefer-style mineralization and demonstrating the potential of the 15-km mineralized corridor to host a significant deposit. Results to date support Max Resource&CloseCurlyQuote;s thesis that the Cesar Basin is host to multiple large-scale copper-silver deposits, with a new drilling program at AM slated for Q4 2024 to put this thesis to the test. The Conejo discovery The Conejo discovery, reported in March 2021 , is a copper-silver system boasting multiple mineralized outcrops, each of them open in all directions and located only 30 km south of the AM discovery. Highlight assays from rock panel samples delineating an initial 1.6 km by 0.6 km zone include: 12.5 per cent copper and 83.5 g/t silver over 5 m by 5 m 10.4 per cent copper and 95 g/t silver over 5 m by 5 m 9.5 per cent copper and 120 g/t silver over 1 m by 1 m A few months later, in May 2021 , the junior copper stock expanded Conejo by 500 per cent to 3.2 km by 1.6 km thanks to additional rock panel assays, most notably 3 per cent copper and 22.6 g/t silver over multiple 1 m by 1 m intervals. Max followed this up with continued expansion in October 2021 to 3.2 km by 1.9 km backed by reconnaissance sampling grading up to 3.3 per cent copper and 54 g/t silver. News of further progress hit the wires in November 2021 , expanding Conejo to more than 3.7 km averaging 4.9 per cent copper, while remaining open in all directions, further substantiating the property&CloseCurlyQuote;s scalable potential into a standalone copper project. Management is confident that Conejo&CloseCurlyQuote;s copper-silver mineralization is analogous to the Central African Copper Belt (CACB), which accounts for approximately one-fifth of the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s copper production, including Ivanhoe Mines&CloseCurlyQuote; (TSX:IVN) 95-billion-pound Kamoa-Kakula copper deposits in the Congo. Conejo&CloseCurlyQuote;s history marks it as a key source of shareholder value, which management intends to unlock through further sampling sometime between Q4 2024 and Q1 2025, after it finalizes work at AM. The URU discovery The URU discovery, reported in April 2021 , is part of a 20-km-long, 2-km-wide CACB-type system residing only 30 km south of Conejo. Max initially delineated copper mineralization over 4 km of strike, with highs of 5.7 per cent copper and 14 g/t silver, but promptly tripled this figure to 12 km in July thanks to additional rock chip samples. More high grades in October 2021 quadrupled the property to 48 square km, with a standout assay of 14.8 per cent copper and 132 g/t silver in outcrop over 1.5 m by 0.8 m. (Source: Max Resource) The junior copper stock then proceeded to drill target definition from December 2021 (9.6 per cent copper and 70 g/t silver over 1 m by 1 m) through April 2022 (16.8 m at 8.3 per cent copper and 146 g/t silver), followed by an expansion of the main URU discovery in June , setting the stage for a maiden 2,200-m drill program . Assays from URU released in January 2023 confirmed high-grade copper-silver in the Cesar Basin, marking the first successful test for mineral continuity at depth in the basin, as evidenced by: 9 m of 7 per cent copper and 115 g/t silver from surface, as well as 0.8 m of 18.5 per cent copper and 292 g/t silver, at URU-C 19 m of 1.3 per cent copper at URU-CE 12 holes intersecting mineralized zones, six intersecting significant copper-silver mineralization, and all holes yielding considerable alteration associated with a district-scale hydrothermal system With 74 square km in approved mining concessions, and more drilling planned to expand mineral continuity and target higher-grade zones, the URU district offers exposure to proven promise for an economically extractable copper-silver deposit. More than 150 years of mining and finance expertise Behind CESAR&CloseCurlyQuote;s strong indications of a world-class resource is a management team with a long track record of mineral discoveries, representing a value-add in excess of C$2 billion. Brett Matich – who has served as Max Resource&CloseCurlyQuote;s chief executive officer since 2018, in addition to serving as president and director – is a 25-year mining industry veteran who has held CEO positions in public companies listed in Australia, London and Toronto. These include: Aztec Resources, where he led the development of the Koolan DSO hematite deposit, and grew the company from A$1 million in market capitalization to a A$300 million merger with Mount Gibson Iron (ASX: MGX) Fox Resources, where he reactivated the Karratha nickel-copper mine in just two years, including reserve estimate and bankable feasibility study Cap-Ex Ventures, where he developed an un-drilled magnetite prospect into a compliant 7.8-billion-tonne resource at 29 per cent iron ore, achieving TSX Venture 50 status in 2012. Matich&CloseCurlyQuote;s extensive and diversified mining expertise is complemented by executives of equal calibre across M&A, capital markets, geology and exploration and development. Meet them below: Alex Helmel, chief financial officer, specializes in early-stage venture companies in Canadian capital markets, specifically private-to-public market transitions, corporate governance, senior management development and corporate growth strategy. He has served as a director or officer for numerous private, CSE- and TSXV-listed companies. Bruce Counts, senior technical consultant, has built a more than 30-year career in international mineral exploration, project development and deposit evaluation across copper, gold and diamonds. Counts, a registered professional geoscientist, has also founded and served as director and/or executive for numerous publicly listed companies. Rahim Kassim-Lakha, strategic advisor, is the founder and CEO of Blue Sail Capital, which boasts a track record of more than 28 years in global investing, capital markets and M&A advisory. Kassim-Lakha previously held leadership roles at Fidelity Capital and Toronto-based banks and boutiques, as well as that of portfolio manager at U.S. Global Investors, where he orchestrated and contributed to more than US$5 billion in high-value transactions. Chris Grainger, Colombian geology expert, whose 25-year career has focused on grassroots and brownfield exploration, as well as resource definition and development, across numerous geologies and commodities. His previous roles include vice president of exploration at Cordoba Minerals (TSXV:CDB) , chief geologist at Colossus Minerals, and founder of Continental Gold , the latter acquired by Zijin for C$1.4 billion. Tim Henneberry, advisor and qualified person, who has more than 42 years of experience in domestic and international exploration and production across base metals, precious metals and industrial minerals. He has occupied the roles of founder, director, senior officer, and/or consultant for various CSE- and TSXV-listed companies since 2004, and currently holds board positions with Golden Independence Mining, Hilo Mining, iMetal Resources, J4 Ventures, Silver Sands Resources, Tana Resources and Treviso Capital. He also sits on the advisory boards of Atomic Minerals and Universal Copper. Backed by heavy-hitting mining professionals, and a high-grade project suggestive of playing a meaningful role in Colombian decarbonization, it is no surprise numerous institutions have already taken positions in the junior copper stock, including Franklin Templeton (5 per cent), Merk Investments (5 per cent), and profitable precious metals producer Endeavour Silver (5 per cent) – the latter having signed a term sheet in March 2022 to help Max expand its land holdings at CESAR. These investments are in addition to a 5 per cent allocation by legendary mining investor Eric Sprott, all of which significantly de-risk the stock for retail investors. A gem in the bargain bin Sitting at an irrational 93.45 per cent loss since 2019, shares of Max Resource are currently priced for exponential upside, as more drill targets based on high-resolution magnetic and radiometric survey data, as well as ongoing mapping, sampling and geochemistry, ride the tailwind of copper demand to wider market awareness. When the junior miner begins drilling later this year – self-funded with almost C$8.7 million in cash as of Q3 2023 – it will do so on concessions that span less than 20 per cent of its 1,000 square km land package, leaving plenty of room for additional copper-silver prospects to be delineated, given prospecting and drilling results to date, propelling CESAR ever closer to identifying an economically extractable deposit. While the CESAR project is strategically positioned to serve the global copper market, with the United States to the north, and Europe, Africa, and Asia to the east, Kassim-Lakha noted that Max would not have to do business anywhere other than Colombia to generate robust shareholder returns. “We&CloseCurlyQuote;re a different type of deposit,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; he said in a recent interview with Stockhouse. “We&CloseCurlyQuote;re a different kind of beast. The Cesar Basin has the potential to become a world-class copper-silver region in Colombia, with only 1 per cent of the country&CloseCurlyQuote;s land package in the resource space producing something outside of oil and gas, and only 2 per cent having been explored. Colombia is moving towards an energy transition, and Max Resource is positioned to expedite it, with a resource at any one among AM, Conejo or URU capable of becoming a company maker.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Matich echoed this sentiment, adding that “we&CloseCurlyQuote;ve had representatives from numerous global miners and institutional investors on site, even before we had a drill hole,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; highlighting the appeal Max Resource is building among major players, who will only knock on the junior miner&CloseCurlyQuote;s door with increasing frequency at it expands mineralization on its 100-per-cent-owned land package. As Max connects the dots between AM, Conejo and URU, investors looking for undervalued exposure to an expertly managed, potentially district-scale asset, should not hesitate to put the junior copper stock through a full due diligence process.

To avoid settling for mediocre returns and falling short of long-term financial goals, individual investors should keep on top of stocks making money through modern means, paving the way for the next generation of practitioners in their industries to build legacies and create shareholder value. To get our readers started, here are three innovative stocks to consider over the weekend, each of which is backed by an underlying company embracing a future-oriented approach to serving its target market. Royalties Inc. Royalties Inc. (CSE:RI) is building a portfolio of uncorrelated, yield-generating royalties with a consistent track record across multiple assets, price levels and terms. The company owns a 2 per cent stake in Music Royalties , a Canadian acquirer of passive music royalties that currently owns 27 cash-flowing investments yielding 7.2 per cent per year, including songs from Rihanna, Jay-Z, Avril Lavigne, Jennifer Lopez and the Backstreet Boys. Other music-related holdings include a selection of American songwriters&CloseCurlyQuote; public performance royalties paid by Broadcast Music yielding 9 per cent per year, and an interest in the publishing and public performance royalties of songs performed by artists including Britney Spears, Joe, Michael Jackson and R. Kelly, which are paid by SOCAN and Universal Music Publishing Group and also yield 9 per cent per year. Additionally, Royalties Inc.&CloseCurlyQuote;s portfolio is diversified by: A 100 per cent interest, subject to a 1.5 per cent net smelter royalty, in the strategically located Bilbao silver-lead-zinc-copper project in Zacatecas, Mexico 88 per cent of the outstanding shares of Minera Portree de Zacatecas, which holds a 2 per cent net smelter royalty on six mining concessions on Capstone Copper&CloseCurlyQuote;s Cozamin Mine , which has generated free cash flow at all points of the copper price cycle since its first full year of operation in 2007 Considering music&CloseCurlyQuote;s universal appeal, the high calibre of the artists behind the royalties, and silver&CloseCurlyQuote;s strong case for a near-term breakout , not to mention the attractiveness of passive income&CloseCurlyQuote;s ability to unlock free time, Royalties Inc. makes for a compelling allocation opportunity worth a thorough look. Shares of Royalties Inc. have given back 30 per cent year-over-year, and are down by more than 84 per cent from their five-year high. Tim Gallagher, Royalties Inc.&CloseCurlyQuote;s chief executive officer, recently sat down with Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Ryan Dhillon to provide an overview of the company. Vertiqal Studios Our second innovative stock pick is Vertiqal Studios (TSX:VRTS) , which is dedicated to the creation and distribution of viral videos. The company produces more than 100 videos per day across 138 owned-and-operated channels, which command an audience of more than 43 million followers and subscribers and generate more than 2 billion views per month. Some of the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s standout accounts include @gaming (10.5 million followers) and @gamelancer (5.1 million followers) on TikTok, @Egirl (1.9 million followers) on Snapchat, and @gaming (882,000 followers) on Instagram. While Vertiqal has only put up net losses on its income statement, the company is making notable operational improvements on the road to profitability. These include a 51 per cent reduction in adjusted EBITDA loss, a 24 per cent reduction in normalized cash expenses, and a 47 per cent increase in gross margin in fiscal 2023, all while growing revenue by 36 per cent year-over-year to C$4,845,926. The company expects growth to continue in 2024, with positive adjusted EBITDA and guided revenue of C$8.6 million, representing 79 per cent growth year-over-year, thanks to deals with TikTok and Meta, Snapchat portfolio growth, and video production expansion across the U.S. market. Backed by a direct line to millennial and Gen Z audiences, and a track record of connecting them with high-profile brand partners, including the NHL, the NCAA, Royal Bank of Canada, Samsung and Universal Music Group, Vertiqal is the beneficiary of strong barriers to entry that make it a valuable partner to brands, agencies and creators looking for turnkey production and distribution on social media. The market disagrees, having pushed shares of Vertiqal Studios down by 84.62 per cent since July 2023, opening the door for a contrarian play to capitalize on robust marketing operations tailored to the internet age. Jon Dwyer, Vertiqal Studios&CloseCurlyQuote; chief executive officer, joined Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Ryan Dhillon earlier this week to comment on the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s fiscal 2023 results. Odd Burger Our final innovative stock pick for the week is Odd Burger (TSXV:ODD) , a franchised vegan fast-food restaurant, as well as a manufacturer of a proprietary line of plant-based protein and dairy alternatives. The company is positioning itself to ride a global multi-billion dollar vegan fast-food tailwind , propelled by the need for more sustainable food sources , by rolling out more than 100 locations across the world differentiated by their small square footage (less than 1,000 sq. ft), vertically integrated supply chain, and automated cooking technology that requires as little as one staff member on duty. Similar to Vertiqal Studios, Odd Burger has been loss-making since inception, though it has made great strides towards generating shareholder value. The company grew revenue by more than 200 per cent from C$1.07 million in 2020 to C$3.2 million in 2023, while achieving consistent gross profitability since 2022 and cutting cash flow used in operating activities in 2023 by 50 per cent year-over-year. In Q1 2024, Odd Burger was also able to reduce its quarterly loss to C$275,808 – representing an 81.9 per cent improvement quarter-over-quarter and a robust 78.1 per cent improvement year-over-year – as well as record its highest gross margin as a public company, coming in at 33.3 per cent of revenue, a 103.3 per cent improvement year-over-year. With more than 70 billion land animals killed per year for food and humans&CloseCurlyQuote; threat to biodiversity worsening with each passing day, an investment in Odd Burger is an investment in the sustainable eating practices the world must adopt to tame climate change and reach net-zero goals. Shares of Odd Burger are up by 14.29 per cent year-over-year, but have given back 33.33 per cent since 2019. James McInnes, Odd Burger&CloseCurlyQuote;s co-founder and chief executive officer, sat down with Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Ryan Dhillon to discuss the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s financial results for Q1 2024.

{"source_name": "Stockhouse Canada", "title": "Is it time for a change to Canadian pension funds?", "title_link": "https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2024/04/03/is-it-time-for-change-to-canadian-pension-funds", "author": "Jonathon Brown", "Description": "Canadian pension funds urged to boost domestic investments A recent development with Canada Pension Plan (CPP) has sparked attention across Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s financial landscape. Around 100 prominent Canadian business leaders have united to advocate for a significant adjustment in the investment strategies of the nation&CloseCurlyQuote;s pension plans. Their collective voice, expressed through an open letter addressed to Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, emphasized the importance of encouraging Canadian pension funds to redirect more of their capital towards investments within the country&CloseCurlyQuote;s borders. The key message conveyed by these influential figures is not a call for stringent restrictions but rather a plea for a nuanced alteration in the regulatory framework. Instead of imposing a hard cap on investments made abroad, the signatories propose a subtle adjustment to the rules, designed to incentivize major pension plans such as the CPP to allocate a greater portion of their resources towards Canadian enterprises and projects. One of the driving forces behind this initiative is Letko Brosseau & Associates , a reputable money management firm based in Montreal. The firm has previously expressed concerns over the diminishing proportion of capital that Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s major pension plans deploy within the domestic market. According to the open letter, the eight largest pension plans in Canada currently hold more assets invested in China than they do in their own country, a statistic that underscores the urgency of the situation. Minister Freeland told reporters that Canadian pension funds are “one of the crown jewels of our country&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; and confirmed that she spoke to the fund leaders about how to “encourage&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; domestic investment. “We said that we were committed as a government to working collaboratively with Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s pension funds to help them find more opportunities to invest here in Canada, our remarkable country,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; she said. Freeland met with executives from Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s nine largest pension funds in early March as the Liberal party prepares its 2024 budget, set to be tabled on April 16 . Why this matters The significance of this movement extends beyond mere economic considerations; it reflects a broader narrative surrounding the role of institutional investors in shaping the trajectory of the Canadian economy. By advocating for a recalibration of investment strategies, the signatories are striving to bolster domestic industries, foster innovation, and fortify the nation&CloseCurlyQuote;s economic resilience. One notable development that aligns with this call for increased domestic investment is the recent decision by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) to reduce its presence in China. Reports indicate that CPPIB has downsized approximately 10 percent of its Hong Kong-based staff focused on Chinese equities. While this adjustment might seem modest in numerical terms, its symbolic significance resonates within the context of broader trends observed among Canadian pension plans. The CPPIB&CloseCurlyQuote;s move follows similar actions taken by other major pension funds in Canada, including the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan and British Columbia&CloseCurlyQuote;s public pension manager. These decisions underscore a growing sentiment among institutional investors to reassess their exposure to Chinese markets, particularly in light of recent economic challenges faced by the country. Background on CPP investments CPP is one of Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s most significant social programs, designed to provide retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to eligible contributors and their families. However, what many Canadians might not realize is that the CPP also involves a robust investment strategy managed by the CPPIB. The CPPIB is responsible for investing CPP funds not needed to pay current benefits, with the aim of maximizing returns without undue risk. Established in 1997, the CPPIB operates at arm&CloseCurlyQuote;s length from the government and reports to Parliament through the Minister of Finance. Its mandate is to invest in various asset classes globally to help ensure the long-term sustainability of the CPP. Major Canadian pension funds include CPP investments, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) and the Ontario Teachers&CloseCurlyQuote; Pension Plan (OTPP), among others. Asset classes and investment strategy The CPPIB invests across several asset classes, including active equities, capital markets, credit investments, private equity and real assets. This diversified approach aims to mitigate risks and optimize returns over the long term. Active equities: This asset class involves investments in publicly traded companies where the CPPIB takes an active role in managing investments to generate returns. Capital markets: CPPIB invests in a wide range of financial instruments, including fixed income securities, currencies and derivatives, to capitalize on global market opportunities. Credit investments: CPPIB&CloseCurlyQuote;s credit investments include debt securities, loans and other credit-related instruments, offering stable returns with moderate risk exposure. Private equity: This asset class involves investments in privately held companies, providing opportunities for significant long-term growth and diversification. Real assets: CPPIB invests in tangible assets such as real estate, infrastructure, and natural resources, which offer inflation protection and steady income streams. Financial sustainability of the fund The most recent triennial report by the Chief Actuary of Canada confirmed that the CPP is financially sustainable for the next 75 years. (Source: cppinvestments.com) Notable holdings and valuations (2023) With C$590.8 billion in the fund as of Dec. 31, 2023, the most recent triennial report by the Chief Actuary of Canada confirmed that the CPP is financially sustainable for the next 75 years. According to the CPPIB&CloseCurlyQuote;s 2023 annual report , some of its notable Canadian investments and their valuations include: Active equities: CPPIB holds significant positions in leading Canadian companies across various sectors, contributing to the growth and stability of the fund. Specific valuations and holdings can be found in the CPPIB&CloseCurlyQuote;s Annual Report. Capital markets: The CPPIB&CloseCurlyQuote;s investments in Canadian capital markets encompass a diverse range of securities, reflecting its commitment to maximizing returns while managing risk. Credit investments: CPPIB&CloseCurlyQuote;s credit investments in Canada include corporate bonds, loans, and other debt instruments, providing stable income and diversification benefits. By applying the fund&CloseCurlyQuote;s structural capabilities – long horizon, certainty of assets and scale – and its developed sources of unique insights, CPP investments can identify opportunities that other market participants overlook or miss. Private equity: CPPIB has made substantial investments in North American private equity opportunities , supporting the growth and expansion of domestic companies. Some of the more popular holdings include Google parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) . Real assets: CPPIB&CloseCurlyQuote;s real assets portfolio in Canada comprises investments in infrastructure projects, real estate developments, and natural resource assets, contributing to economic growth and development. Enbridge (TSX:ENB) since 2018. The open market impact and beyond The implications of these developments extend beyond the realm of finance; they signal a potential shift in the geopolitical landscape as well. As major Canadian pension plans scale back their investments in China, the global dynamics of capital flows are likely to undergo significant changes, with potential ramifications for Canadian and international markets. While the ultimate impact of these initiatives remains to be seen, one thing is clear: The call for increased domestic investment by Canadian pensions represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of the country&CloseCurlyQuote;s financial ecosystem. As stakeholders continue to engage in dialogue and policymakers deliberate on potential reforms, the outcomes of these deliberations will shape the trajectory of Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s economic future. In a world of evolving uncertainties, this movement stands as a beacon of proactive engagement and collective action towards a more robust and resilient financial landscape. Parting thoughts The CPP&CloseCurlyQuote;s investment strategy plays a vital role in ensuring the long-term sustainability of the CPP. Through diversified investments across various asset classes, the CPPIB aims to generate optimal returns while effectively managing risk. As of 2023, the CPPIB continues to demonstrate strong performance, with notable holdings in Canadian companies and assets across different sectors. Overall, the CPP&CloseCurlyQuote;s investment approach underscores its commitment to securing the financial future of all Canadians.

Among the myriad opportunities in the gold sector, one company has been making waves with its promising opportunities – GMV Minerals Inc. (TSXV:GMV) . ( OTCQB: GMVMF ) Positioned at the forefront of junior gold development, GMV Minerals has captured the attention of investors with its flagship Mexican Hat project, situated in the southeastern part of Arizona. Let&CloseCurlyQuote;s delve into the intricacies of this project and explore why it is an enticing proposition for investors. Background on the Mexican Hat Project (Source: GMV Minerals Inc.) The Mexican Hat project is GMV Minerals&CloseCurlyQuote; PEA level gold asset, and it holds a 100 per cent interest. In a region renowned for its rich mineral endowment in Cochise County, the mining heart of Arizona, this project encompasses approximately 20 square km. of prime exploration terrain with significant gold potential. What sets Mexican Hat apart is its strategic location within a prolific mining district, offering access to established infrastructure and a favourable regulatory environment. About 112 km southeast of Tucson, the Mexican Hat property is one of the most promising gold development opportunities in the western United States. The epithermal gold deposit was extensively explored by Placer Dome in the early 1990s prior to it being bought by Barrick Gold. This low sulphidation, hydrothermal epithermal gold deposit rests in tertiary volcanic rocks. Similar deposits within the same basin and range province in Nevada, such as Round Mountain under Kinross Gold Corp. (TSX:K) and the Midas Deposit operated by Hecla Mining Co. (NYSE:HL), which host many million ounces of gold. Highlights of the preliminary economic assessment (PEA) In November 2020, GMV Minerals Inc. unveiled the results of its preliminary economic assessment ( PEA ) for the Mexican Hat Project, signaling a major milestone in its development journey. (Source: GMV Minerals Inc.) The PEA reported 36.7 million tonnes grading .58 grams per tonne (gpt) gold in a 688,000 oz. inferred mineral resource. The report identified two open pits with a 1.87:1 strip ratio which was modeled to extract 32.6 million tonnes of this deposit recovering 525,000 oz. of gold over a 10-year mine life. This is a low capital cost operation, full retail cost of US$67.8 million, (quoting all new equipment) which includes US$12 million in contingency and US$13 million in sustaining capital. Heap leach testing demonstrates an exceptional recovery of 88 per cent of the gold from a two-stage crushing circuit. “With US$2,200/oz. gold, if we made money at US$1,600, you can imagine at US$2,200 the numbers are significantly better,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; CEO Ian Klassen said in an interview with the Market Online Canada. The PEA outlined a robust economic case, showcasing the project&CloseCurlyQuote;s potential to emerge as a profitable gold mine. Key highlights of the PEA include: Impressive resource estimates: The PEA confirmed the presence of a substantial gold resource at Mexican Hat. Favourable economics: The economic analysis revealed compelling financial metrics, including a projected discounted pre-tax net present value (NPV) of US$395 million and an internal rate of return (IRR) better than 77 per cent. Scalability and growth potential: The PEA underscored the scalability of the Mexican Hat Project, with opportunities for expansion and optimization to enhance operational efficiency and maximize shareholder value. Sustainable development approach: GMV Minerals emphasized its commitment to responsible mining practices, incorporating environmental and social considerations into the project&CloseCurlyQuote;s development framework. Management&CloseCurlyQuote;s take – a clear path to production Gold prices are up more than 13 per cent over the past six months and recently hit a record high above US$2,200. Gold has seen a lot of upward movement after the Federal Reserve brushed off multiple hotter-than-expected inflation reports and reaffirmed its outlook for three interest rate cuts this year. Klassen explained that, for a project that will likely take less than US$50 million to put into production, to have a discounted NPV in excess of C$500 million, institutional money may well gravitate towards Mexican Hat. He further noted some downward pressure on the U.S. dollar would also help the gold price, pointing to recent commentary from the likes of JP Morgan prognosticating its value to reach US$2,300 and higher this year. “I think that if we see in the early days of April that we stayed above US$2,100, I think it is a good signal for a lot of institutions that they might want to start allocating a portion of their money back into the space, which would help a company like ours because, there is probably not a clearer path to production for a company this size in the southwestern United States,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Klassen said. (Source: GMV Minerals Inc.) Meet the team GMV Minerals&CloseCurlyQuote; leadership team brings a wealth of experience and expertise to the table. Lead consultant Dr. David Webb, B.A.Sc., M.Sc., Ph.D., P.Geo., P.Eng. is the project manager in the field. He has had a 40-year career continuous in mineral exploration and development. He put a gold mine into production in Mongolia and has put mines in production in the Northwest Territories where he is currently developing a project. He is also a mining engineer and has been working with GMV since day one on developing Mexican Hat. More technical members are on the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s advisory board, as well as part of its management team in directors Carl Hale, B.Sc., R.P.G, Q.P. and Robert Coltura, who has been working in the markets, financing wise, for several years. Joel Schneyer is another advisory board member and has been hailed by Klassen as a “very sound and stable hand&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; for the company to make key introductions. “We have day-to-day expertise, but we also have forward-looking help that we have been able to bring in that have been able to open up their Rolodexes and make some very good introductions for us going forward, and we just see that continuing,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Klassen added. 2016 Reverse circulation drill program at the Medicine Hat Project. (Source: GMV Minerals Inc.) Investment corner As a sign of the current junior market sentiment a market capitalization of just C$14.25 million, GMV Minerals Inc. presents investors with a unique opportunity to capitalize on the potential of the Mexican Hat project and the broader gold market. With a solid foundation of geological merit and a favourable PEA demonstrating robust economics, the company is poised for significant value creation in the years ahead. Investing in GMV Minerals Inc. offers exposure to: A high-quality asset: The Mexican Hat project boasts substantial gold resources in a mining-friendly jurisdiction, positioning GMV Minerals for long-term success. Exploration upside: The company&CloseCurlyQuote;s exploration efforts continue to unlock additional value potential, with ongoing drilling campaigns aimed at expanding the resource base and delineating new mineralization zones. A strategic advantage: GMV Minerals Inc. benefits from an experienced management team with a proven track record in exploration and project development, providing confidence in the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s ability to execute its growth strategy effectively. Since this time last year, GMV stock has moved 83.33 per cent higher and has shown steady growth of 26.92 per cent since 2019. In conclusion, GMV Minerals Inc. stands as a compelling investment opportunity in the junior gold development sector, driven by the promising prospects of the Mexican Hat project and a commitment to value creation for shareholders.

{"source_name": "Stockhouse Canada", "title": "Five lessons from CPP's portfolio and investment strategy", "title_link": "https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2024/04/10/five-lessons-from-cpp-s-portfolio-and-investment-strategy", "author": " Trevor Abes ", "Description": "The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a monthly, taxable benefit to partially replace your income after you retire and for the rest of your life. To qualify, you must be a minimum of 60 years old and have made at least one valid contribution to the pension, most likely as a percentage of your paycheck. CPP payments are calculated by the age you start to receive your pension, how much and for how long you contributed for, and your average earnings across your working life. For context, the average monthly amount paid for a new pension at age 65 in January 2024 was C$831.92 out of a maximum of C$1,364.60. CPP Investments , the Crown Corporation in charge of running the CPP, is tasked with building and sustaining an investment portfolio to meet the needs of approximately 21 million contributors and beneficiaries. Its investment strategy, geared towards generational growth and wealth preservation, has yielded a 9.3 per cent return over the past decade ending in 2023 – comfortably ahead of the TSX&CloseCurlyQuote;s 6.7 per cent – having accumulated approximately C$590.8 billion in assets under management as of Dec. 31. While institutional portfolios are vastly different in scope compared with individual investors, CPP&CloseCurlyQuote;s strategy offers key lessons for Stockhouse readers when it comes to financial planning, portfolio construction and risk management on the road to fulfilling their financial goals. 1. Global diversification CPP Investments structures its portfolio to thrive in up and down markets, without having to depend on the performance of any one country, currency or region. In this way, it minimizes risk and establishes long-term resiliency so your monthly cheques keep rolling in uninterrupted. To this end, the Crown Corporation holds positions in all major asset classes, including public equities, private equities, fixed income, credit, real estate and infrastructure, as well as across 55 developed and emerging countries, with individual weightings determined by risk-return analysis from the institution&CloseCurlyQuote;s many boots on the ground around the world. Here&CloseCurlyQuote;s a snapshot of the CPP portfolio as of March 31, 2023: (Source: CPP Investments) The portfolio, rebalanced yearly to right-size risk, is a testament to how investors can benefit from owning a little bit of everything, contingent on risk tolerance and risk capacity, to ensure a smoother ride over an investment lifetime. When a certain sector or section of the world endures harsher economic conditions, leading to downward price pressure, other portfolio holdings will be thriving and carrying most of the weight, eventually resulting in positive long-term returns in line with market history. Without counting private equity, which requires investors to be accredited to participate, you can replicate the CPP&CloseCurlyQuote;s portfolio by investing in a market capitalization-weighted portfolio of index funds. Supposing you are multiple decades away from retirement, and don&CloseCurlyQuote;t need any bonds to preserve value and smooth out volatility, you could pick up units in Vanguard&CloseCurlyQuote;s all-stock index fund portfolio, VEQT , whose current allocation stands at 45.69 per cent U.S., 29.12 per cent Canada, 18.57 per cent Developed ex-North America, and 6.62 per cent Emerging Markets. Sharp readers will note that Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s global market capitalization is closer to 3 per cent than 30, pointing to VEQT&CloseCurlyQuote;s and CPP Investments&CloseCurlyQuote; home-country bias . This common and controversial feature, which is often justified for psychological reasons, is one many would like to see expanded within CPP to foster innovation and bolster economic resiliency. 2. Time in the market beats timing the market The CPP must serve Canadians over multiple generations, requiring a time horizon well beyond that of average individual investors, who may save more than 30 or 40 years in the workforce before retiring and relying on their portfolios for income. The most recent report by the Chief Actuary of Canada demonstrates the CPP to be sustainable over the next 75 years. The fund can hold on to its investments and capitalize on buying opportunities during market downturns thanks to its large scale and predictable cash flows from contributions, which expose it to deal flow smaller players wouldn&CloseCurlyQuote;t have access to. In this way, CPP Investments can absorb short-term volatility and meet redemption requests, while taking full advantage of long-term compound interest. (Source: Looker_Studio) Individual investors would be wise to follow CPP&CloseCurlyQuote;s lead and sock money away they don&CloseCurlyQuote;t need for at least 20 years , the minimum holding period to ensure you earn a return on stocks, according to an Oppenheimer study on the S&P 500&CloseCurlyQuote;s performance since 1950. From a broader perspective, a portfolio of globally diversified stocks has generated about 5 per cent above inflation going back to 1900. When we compare these returns to those of day traders , more than 80 per cent of which will lose money by this time next year, it becomes clear that, when it comes to your financial future, the slow and steady approach is the only rational way forward. 3. Biting off what you can chew The team at CPP Investments, like any prudent allocator, knows to take only enough risk to meet its objectives, which are to let its holdings grow, meet redemption requests, and generate enough dry powder to make new value-accretive investments. Expressed as a portfolio, this level of risk translates into 85 per cent global stocks and 15 per cent Canadian government bonds, an aggressive allocation positioned to maximize long-term returns. According to historical data from Canadian Portfolio Manager , a portfolio in the 80/20 range could swing by an average of 9.35 per cent in either direction in any given year, and might experience a maximum drawdown of a third or more, with the owner having to wait almost four years for their investments to recover. (Source: MP Studio) If you believe yourself able to withstand these fluctuations, you stand to reap an annualized return of about 7 per cent, based on the past 20 years of performance data, in the wheelhouse of what CPP has been able to achieve over the past decade. Conversely, if the thought of losing a third of your money would keep you up at night, or if 7 per cent won&CloseCurlyQuote;t quite cut it in terms of meeting your financial goals, you can use CPP as a guide to finetune your asset allocation using Portfolio Visualizer&CloseCurlyQuote;s back-testing tool . Simply input the ticker symbols for stocks or funds you&CloseCurlyQuote;d like to test, with the aim of building a portfolio aligned with what you&CloseCurlyQuote;re investing for, how long you have to invest, and how you react during periods of market volatility. 4. A research process tailored to your needs Backed by billions in yearly contributions, CPP has the capital to hire hundreds of specialists, whose sole job is to research and allocate into prospective investments based on current market conditions. This means identifying undervalued investments to buy, overvalued investments to sell, as well as opportunities to use leverage, with eyes on generating as high of a return as possible without putting pension recipients at undue risk. The CPP portfolio also directly owns real estate, infrastructure and controlling interests in businesses, allowing managers to play an active role in day-to-day operations, and build on the institution&CloseCurlyQuote;s legacy of promoting enhanced governance, environmental, social and operational corporate practices. (Source: CYB3RUSS) As an individual investor, the question to ask here is, how do your skills and temperament match up with someone who makes investing and building businesses their livelihood? Are you among the less than 30 per cent of do-it-yourself investors who make money by discovering mispriced stocks, buying them against the herd, and holding them through volatility to come out ahead? Or are you better suited to passively investing in broad-market index funds , a proven rinse-and-repeat strategy, and using the extra time for passions and family? If you decide to go the stock-picking route, you should have a clear sense of why you&CloseCurlyQuote;re positioned to beat the odds and shoot for the moon, when the portfolios of so many flounder at the task. 5. Playing your game CPP&CloseCurlyQuote;s billions in predictable annual contributions allow it to participate in large transactions capable of moving the needle on its growing asset base. These include the US$1.6 billion acquisition of the 99¢ Only Stores franchise in 2012, the US$20 billion acquisition of data and financial technology platform Refinitiv in 2018, a C$7.1 billion investment in a 50 per cent stake in the Highway 407 Express Toll Route, billions put to work with leading investment managers , and interests in numerous real estate properties across the world. The institution thinks big with its investments because it has no other choice, having to dip its toes across the investable universe using sophisticated tools, systems and analytics to ensure a more stable retirement for millions of Canadians. To leave a stone unturned could mean reduced long-term returns, and the difference between financial independence and someone&CloseCurlyQuote;s golden years shimmering less than they should. (Source: Piscine26) The scope of an individual investor&CloseCurlyQuote;s potential allocations requires far less exoticism, in comparison, for the simple reason that what counts as a meaningful amount of money for you or me has little to do with the high-magnitude decisions CPP Investments makes every day. For a portfolio to make a difference in an average person&CloseCurlyQuote;s life, like enabling part-time instead of full-time work, the purchase of a house, or taking care of a loved one&CloseCurlyQuote;s expenses, its value will have to grow into, at minimum, the hundreds of thousands of dollars. And the only way to get there, knowing what we know about the state of most day traders&CloseCurlyQuote; bank accounts, is to invest in stocks – the asset class with the highest historical long-term returns – ideally over a few decades. Instead of pursuing investment growth by playing the role of multi-asset ninja, and running the risk of losing money in an attempt to get rich quick, individual investors owe it to their future selves to stick with established sources of stock market returns , and gain exposure to them either through index funds or a highly refined due diligence process.

{"source_name": "Stockhouse Canada", "title": "This is Canada’s only leisure airline meeting market demand", "title_link": "https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2024/03/25/this-canada-s-only-leisure-airline-meeting-market-demand", "author": "Jocelyn Aspa", "Description": "Airline competition in Canada still needs to improve compared to other countries, but Canada Jetlines Operations (Cboe CA:CJET) is one such airline that gives Canadians a leisurely alternative when flying domestically, to the U.S., or even to Caribbean destinations. With its headquarters out of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Jetlines Operations is primarily a leisure airline that connects passengers to sunny, in-demand destinations. However, its services also include charter and ACMI (aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance) flights to meet the demands of its diverse customer base all year round. Additionally, setting the company apart from its peers in the space is its distinct new entrant advantage: in other words, Canada Jetlines Operations is an airline bringing high customer centricity at an unbeatable price. CJET partnership with European carrier In early March, the company announced a partnership with a European carrier, underscoring the global demand for A320 aircraft. The first aircraft is slated to begin in late April 2024 for a six-month period followed by a second aircraft in July for a three-month period. “In January, we announced the expansion of our fleet to 6 aircraft. The utilization of these planes is widely needed in Europe during their busy season. The two planes will return to Canada for our busy fall/winter travel period to leisure destinations,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Eddy Doyle, CEO of Canada Jetlines Operations, said in a statement. “This partnership underscores our commitment to maximizing efficiency and meeting the seasonal demands of our customers.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Over the summer months, the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s schedule will include the following destinations: Toronto (YYZ) to Halifax (YHZ) Halifax (YHZ) to Orlando (MCO) Toronto (YYZ) to Orlando (MCO) Toronto (YYZ) to Montego Bay (MBJ) Toronto (YYZ) to Cancun (CUN) Demand for leisure air travel Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s airline industry continues its path toward consolidation, which is creating not only a market void but a rise in airfare prices and fewer flight options. According to the Canadian Press , lower-cost airlines such as Swoop and Lynx Air have been eradicated, while WestJet acquired Sunwing Airlines. The Competition Bureau released a report in October 2022 outlining concerns of WestJet&CloseCurlyQuote;s acquisition of Sunwing Airlines, indicating it will result in a “substantial lessening or prevention of competition in the sale of vacation packages to Canadians.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; “Eliminating the rivalry between these integrated airlines and tour operators would likely result in increased prices, less choice and decreases in service for Canadians,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; the Competition Bureau said. “It would also likely result in a significant reduction in travel by Canadians on a variety of routes where their existing travel networks overlap.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; As the demand for leisure air travel continues to rise – and with fewer options currently on the market – this puts Canada Jetlines Operations in a prime position to cater to the demand and essentially fill the gap. Thanks to minimal high fixed costs when compared to legacy carriers burdened by pandemic-related liabilities, Canada Jetlines has a distinct advantage. Case in point, as Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s only boutique airline, the company launched Jetlines Vacations in January of this year, which is a subsidiary company and an all-encompassing vacation experience provider intended to meet the demand for leisure travel to bucket-list destinations. The addition of Jetlines Vacations brings all-inclusive premium vacation packages that include airfare on Canada Jetlines, ground transportation, top-tier hotel accommodations, and options for leisure activities. Destinations also include Montego Bay, Jamaica, Cancun, Mexico, and Orlando, Florida. Jetlines Vacations currently offers over 15,000 room nights to its growing list. Putting it simply, Canada Jetlines Operations&CloseCurlyQuote; entrance into the leisure airline market presents a significant opportunity for it to carve a niche and fuel growth. CJET in the news On March 18, the company announced the delivery of one Airbus A320-200 through a long-term lease from Aviation Capital Group LLC, making it Canada Jetlines&CloseCurlyQuote; fourth aircraft. It has signed lease agreements for two additional Airbus A320 aircraft that are scheduled for delivery in Q2 2024. “We are excited to partner with Aviation Capital Group LLC and welcome this new addition to our fleet. This A320-200 delivery marks a significant step in our growth strategy, allowing us to enhance our service offerings and expand our operations to better serve our customers. Canada Jetlines&CloseCurlyQuote; unique business strategy of focusing on charter/ACMI flights, along with a leisure destination-focused scheduled service operation, allows it to be competitive with a sustainable growth strategy,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Doyle said in a statement. The company also recently closed the third and final tranche of its $13.5 million equity financing. Led by Jetstream Aviation. Canada Jetlines will use the net proceeds for aircraft acquisition, general corporate and working capital purposes. The investment corner Despite the challenges in the airline industry, the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s scheduled flying that is sold to the public is only a fraction of its business activities. With a significant portion of its business consisting of charter flights and flying for other airlines, Canada Jetlines Operations represents a unique play in the space. As such, under its umbrella are three revenue streams with diversified growth potential, including passenger revenue, chartered/ACMI flights and Jetlines Vacations. Fueling its future growth is its leadership team which has a cumulative experience of over 70 years. Doyle, for example, was a former pilot with the Canadian Air Force and Air Canada with over 11,000 flying hours to his name. His track record includes overseeing a staff of nearly 4,000 at Air Canada and spearheading Bamboo Airways&CloseCurlyQuote; remarkable growth in Vietnam, scaling up to 25 aircraft during his tenure as deputy CEO. With demand for leisure air travel on the rise, and with few options to choose from in Canada, Canada Jetlines Operations just might be your gateway into the market.

{"source_name": "Stockhouse Canada", "title": "Who can benefit from Canada-Germany hydrogen trade deal?", "title_link": "https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2024/03/21/who-can-benefit-from-canada-germany-hydrogen-trade-deal", "author": "Jonathon Brown", "Description": "Canada and Germany have inked a memorandum of understanding to facilitate the commercial-scale trade of clean hydrogen, which holds potential as a clean energy alternative with minimal environmental impact The MoU, signed between the two countries, outlines a commitment to support transactions between Canadian hydrogen producers and Germany&CloseCurlyQuote;s industrial manufacturing and energy distribution sectors With Russia traditionally being a major energy supplier to European nations, recent geopolitical events have underscored the risks associated with overreliance on a single energy source Hydrogen is key to the electrification of vehicles, a market projected to grow from US$500.4 billion in 2023 to US$1.5 trillion in 2030 A significant stride towards fostering sustainable energy partnerships and reducing reliance on fossil fuels was made this week. Canada and Germany have inked a landmark memorandum of understanding (MoU) aimed at accelerating the trade of clean hydrogen fuel. This agreement not only underscores the commitment of both nations to combat climate change but also signals a strategic move to diversify energy sources away from Russian dominance. The MoU, signed between the two countries, outlines a commitment to support transactions between Canadian hydrogen producers and Germany&CloseCurlyQuote;s industrial manufacturing and energy distribution sectors. This collaboration intends to facilitate the commercial-scale trade of clean hydrogen, which holds immense potential as a clean energy alternative with minimal environmental impact. Background: The rise of clean hydrogen Clean hydrogen, produced through processes such as electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources, holds promise as a versatile energy carrier with various applications across industries such as transportation, manufacturing and power generation. Unlike conventional hydrogen production methods that often rely on fossil fuels and emit greenhouse gases, clean hydrogen production produces zero emissions when paired with renewable energy sources. Strategic impetus: Shifting away from Russian energy The timing of this agreement holds particular significance against the backdrop of geopolitical tensions and concerns surrounding energy security, especially in Europe. With Russia traditionally being a major energy supplier to European nations, recent geopolitical events have underscored the risks associated with overreliance on a single energy source. “As Vladimir Putin continues to weaponize energy in his illegal war on Ukraine, Canada is working with European allies to displace imports of Russian oil and gas and fight climate change with clean Canadian hydrogen,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; the federal natural resources ministry stated in a news release . “Canada can be a world-leading producer and exporter of clean hydrogen and associated technologies, and the federal government is helping to make that happen.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; In late February , Germany&CloseCurlyQuote;s economy ministry stated it would earmark up to €3.53 billion (C$5.2 billion) of public funds to procure green hydrogen and its derivatives between 2027 and 2036. By forging this agreement, Canada and Germany are working to position themselves to mitigate such risks by diversifying their energy portfolios and reducing dependency on Russian energy supplies. Clean hydrogen emerges as a compelling alternative, offering a sustainable and reliable energy source that aligns with both countries&CloseCurlyQuote; ambitious climate goals. Key objectives of the memorandum of understanding The MoU between Canada and Germany outlines several key objectives aimed at fostering collaboration and facilitating the trade of clean hydrogen: Supporting transactions: The agreement commits both nations to support transactions between Canadian hydrogen producers and Germany&CloseCurlyQuote;s industrial manufacturing and energy distribution sectors. This support may encompass various forms, including financial incentives, regulatory frameworks, and infrastructure development initiatives. Accelerating deployment: Recognizing the urgency of transitioning to clean energy solutions, the MoU aims to expedite the deployment of clean hydrogen technologies by streamlining regulatory processes, fostering innovation, and promoting investments in research and development. Promoting collaboration: Collaboration between Canadian and German stakeholders, including government agencies, research institutions, and private sector entities, will be encouraged to leverage complementary strengths and expertise in advancing clean hydrogen production, distribution and utilization. Facilitating market access: The agreement seeks to facilitate market access for clean hydrogen produced in Canada, enabling it to reach end-users in Germany&CloseCurlyQuote;s industrial and energy sectors. This may involve the development of trade agreements, market mechanisms, and infrastructure investments to ensure the seamless flow of clean hydrogen across borders. Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s role in the hydrogen economy Canada boasts abundant natural resources, including natural gas and water, which are essential for hydrogen production. With its vast hydroelectric potential, Canada can produce green hydrogen through electrolysis, a process that uses renewable energy to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. On top of this, Canada has substantial reserves of fossil fuels, enabling the production of blue hydrogen with carbon capture and storage technology to mitigate emissions. The country&CloseCurlyQuote;s commitment to sustainability is evident in its rather ambitious climate targets and supportive policies. The government has announced plans to invest in hydrogen infrastructure and research initiatives, creating a conducive environment for the growth of the hydrogen sector. Investing in Canadian hydrogen stocks For investors looking to capitalize on the growing hydrogen market, Canadian stocks offer diverse opportunities across the value chain. Here are some key areas to consider: Hydrogen production: Companies involved in hydrogen production, whether through electrolysis, steam methane reforming, or gasification, stand to benefit from the increasing demand for clean hydrogen. Infrastructure development: Investing in companies that are involved in building hydrogen infrastructure, such as storage facilities, transportation networks, and refueling stations, can be lucrative. Fuel cell technology: Companies specializing in fuel cell technology play a vital role in enabling the widespread adoption of hydrogen-powered vehicles, buses and other applications. Renewable energy integration: As the demand for green hydrogen grows, investments in renewable energy companies that supply clean electricity for electrolysis become increasingly attractive. Canadian hydrogen stocks to watch Hydrogen is key to bringing the electrification of vehicles to the forefront of the automotive industry. The global electric vehicle market size was valued at US$384.6 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow from US$500.4 billion in 2023 to US$1.5 trillion in 2030 according to Fortune Business Insights data. A number of engaging companies are trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Venture Exchange that have been advancing their business in the hydrogen-related fields that could see some upward movement after this signing. As of this writing, these three companies have earned some of the most attention among the Stockhouse Bullboards , and each of their stocks have begun the week trading lower, representing a possible buying opportunity. Ballard Power Systems&CloseCurlyQuote; (TSX:BLDP) principal business is the design, development, manufacture, sale and service of proton exchange membrane fuel cell products for a variety of applications, focusing on power products for bus, truck, rail, marine, stationary and emerging market (material handling, off-road and other) applications. Ballard has a market cap of C$1.15 billion and last traded up 3.50 per cent at C$3.84 per share. Loop Energy (TSX:LPEN) designs and manufactures hydrogen fuel cell systems targeted for the electrification of commercial vehicles, including transit buses and medium to heavy-duty trucks. Its products feature proprietary eFlow technology in the fuel cell stack&CloseCurlyQuote;s bipolar plates. Loop Energy has a market cap of C$5.68 million and last traded up 3.12 per cent at $0.165 per share. First Hydrogen (TSXV:FHYD) is dedicated to producing and distributing green hydrogen and zero-emission vehicles. First Hydrogen has a market cap of C$92.20 million and last traded 3.17 higher at C$1.30 per share. Northland Power (TSX:NPI) is a global power producer dedicated to helping the clean energy transition by producing electricity from clean, renewable resources. The Toronto-based company owns and manages a diversified generation mix, including onshore renewables, natural gas energy, as well as supplying energy through a regulated utility. One of the top juggernauts in this field, Northland Power&CloseCurlyQuote;s market cap weighs in at C$5.88 billion and its stock last traded up 2.41 per cent at C$22.56 per share. Risks to investing in hydrogen While the prospects for hydrogen investments are promising, it&CloseCurlyQuote;s essential for investors to consider the risks associated with this emerging market. Factors such as regulatory uncertainties, technological challenges, and competition from other energy sources could impact the growth trajectory of hydrogen stocks. Market volatility and fluctuations in commodity prices might affect the profitability of hydrogen-related ventures. Investors should always conduct thorough due diligence and assess the long-term viability and sustainability of hydrogen projects before making investment decisions. Diversification across multiple hydrogen stocks and sectors can help mitigate risks and capture opportunities across the value chain. Aiming toward a more sustainable energy future The Canada-Germany agreement represents a significant step forward in the global transition towards a sustainable energy future. By harnessing the potential of clean hydrogen as a clean, versatile and scalable energy carrier, both nations are not only addressing the pressing challenges of climate change but also fostering economic growth, innovation and energy security. The intent to diversify energy sources away from Russian dominance underscores the geopolitical significance of clean hydrogen as a tool for enhancing energy independence and resilience. As other nations join this momentum towards clean hydrogen adoption, the prospects for a decarbonized, sustainable, and resilient global energy system continue to brighten. For your consideration Investing in Canadian hydrogen stocks offers exposure to a rapidly growing market with immense potential for sustainable energy solutions. With Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s abundant resources, innovative technologies, and supportive regulatory environment, the hydrogen sector looks ready for significant growth in the coming years. By carefully evaluating opportunities across the hydrogen value chain and considering potential risks, investors can position themselves to capitalize on this transformative energy transition while contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable future.

Under generationally high interest rates , like the present moment, investors tend to have higher expectations for stock returns, given that they could earn 3-5 per cent by parking their money in a savings account or guaranteed investment certificate. This macroeconomic climate makes small-cap and micro-cap stocks seem unappealing, despite owning high-potential technologies, as many of them have little revenue or profits to show investors and convince them to hold on for the long term. However, as rates trickle down, and banks start to squeeze what they pay for your cash, investors will be forced to move further down the risk spectrum for a satisfactory return, eventually bringing smaller-cap stocks back into their universe of potential allocations. With this thesis in mind, consider the following trio of cheap tech stocks solving multi-billion-dollar problems across waste management, gambling and skin cancer. CHAR Technologies CHAR Technologies (TSXV:YES) is a cleantech and environmental services company focused on biocarbon and renewable energy solutions. CHAR specialize in pyrolysis, a process that transforms woody materials and organic waste into renewable energy, including renewable natural gas (RNG) and green hydrogen, while also yielding biocarbon for use as a filtration medium. (Source: CHAR Technologies) The company&CloseCurlyQuote;s technology allows clients from a diversity of industries to turn low-value biomass, biosolids and agricultural residue into high-value carbon products, and reduce total feedstock mass by up to 90 per cent, resulting in significant greenhouse gas reductions. With the trillion-dollar coal market losing ground to renewable energy with each passing year, and a management team steeped in environmental and energy sector experience, CHAR Technologies is on the verge of commercial biocarbon and RNG production , backed by multiple investments from the Government of Canada and ArcelorMittal. Long-term shareholders have been rewarded for their conviction in CHAR&CloseCurlyQuote;s value proposition, gaining 120 per cent since 2019. Andrew White, CHAR Technologies&CloseCurlyQuote; chief executive officer, spoke with Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Brieanna McCutcheon this past week about the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s C$5.2 million award from the Government of Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s Clean Fuels Fund. Jackpot Digital Our second cheap stock pick this week is Jackpot Digital (TSXV:JJ) , the global leader in dealerless electronic gaming tables. The company&CloseCurlyQuote;s flagship product, the Jackpot Blitz, offers three popular versions of poker – Texas Hold &CloseCurlyQuote;em, Omaha and Five-card Omaha – as well as a growing selection of side games and bets to keep players engaged between, and even during, poker hands. Faced with a need to appeal to younger, tech-savvy gamblers , given their aging middle-aged clientele, casinos are rapidly realizing the cost and efficiency advantages of automation technology are the only way forward. The Jackpot Blitz in action. (Source: Jackpot Digital) Instead of relying on human dealers to shuffle cards or spin roulette tables, casinos can save on staff expenditures and benefit from more plays per hour with dealerless machines such as the Jackpot Blitz, which also record customer game play and demographic information to help operators make more data-driven and value-accretive decisions. With the US$150 billion casino gambling market expected to grow steadily through this decade, Jackpot Digital is actively riding this tailwind, having tripled annual revenue and announcing 25 Blitz deals since 2021, with many others in the pipeline across Canada, Asia, Europe and the United States. Despite the stock&CloseCurlyQuote;s differentiated tech and encouraging growth trajectory, not to mention its potential to go from 3 to 2,000 active Blitz tables in the market over the next three to five years, shares of Jackpot Digital have given back 93.37 per cent since 2019. Mathieu McDonald, Jackpot Digital&CloseCurlyQuote;s vice president of corporate development, spoke with Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Brieanna McCutcheon this past week about the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s first Blitz installation in the land-based casino market. Medicus Pharma Our final cheap stock to keep on your radar is Medicus Pharma (TSXV:MDCX) , a biotech and life sciences company focused on acquiring and developing disruptive assets. The company&CloseCurlyQuote;s management team includes former executives at Amgen, Wyeth, and GlaxoSmithKline, including chief medical officer Edward J. Brennan, who has led clinical development programs that resulted in 10 U.S. FDA drug approvals. Medicus&CloseCurlyQuote; main holding, Skinject , is a development-stage biotech and life sciences company advancing a novel treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer, especially basal cell carcinoma (BCC), using a patented dissolvable microneedle patch to deliver doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic agent, under the skin. (Source: Medicus Pharma) The licensed technology, patented by the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University in 2018, provides a relatively painless alternative to Mohs surgery, an excruciating and invasive, but highly effective procedure that involves meticulously removing layers of skin. Medicus is looking to claim its share of a US$2 billion market opportunity (slide 6) by ushering Skinject through clinical development to demonstrate its doxorubicin-containing microneedle arrays can produce an immune response and kill cancer cells. The portfolio company completed a successful phase-I safety and tolerability study in March 2021 for patients with superficial and nodular BCC. Then, in January 2024, it submitted a phase-II investigational new drug clinical protocol to the FDA for a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicentre study. As SkinJect works through comments from the FDA towards a phase-II trial, it&CloseCurlyQuote;s important to note that its microneedle solution is multiple years away from being cleared for sale – based on typical clinical trial phases – and that Medicus Pharma is in its infancy as a public company, having gained 27.89 per cent since inception in October 2023. These two factors are likely to keep the broader market away from the stock until it establishes a longer track record, leaving investors who recognize Medicus&CloseCurlyQuote; value-add to take advantage of excessive volatility and build a position. Raza Bokhari, Medicus Pharma&CloseCurlyQuote;s chairman and chief executive officer, recently spoke with Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Brieanna McCutcheon about the FDA&CloseCurlyQuote;s comments on Skinject&CloseCurlyQuote;s phase-II study protocol.

Analysts believe earnings will grow by an average of 14% annually over the next three to five years. March Madness is here. During the three-week basketball tournament all eyes will be glued to the live broadcasts, watching as the 68-team tournament culminates in one shining moment April 8. The NCAA makes an estimated US$1.3 billion from March Madness. If you are looking to cash on the tournament, here are some stocks that might see an incline as a result of the NCAA&CloseCurlyQuote;s three-week championship. Nike Inc. NYSE:NKE Sports apparel company NIKE has continued to dominate as the top shoe and jersey provider of teams in the NCAA Tournament. Nike has estimated its earnings growth will be 9.6% for the fiscal year ending May 2024. The Swoosh has also sponsored several NCAA basketball players including Iowa&CloseCurlyQuote;s megastar and highest-earning women&CloseCurlyQuote;s college player, Caitlin Clark . Her overall NIL (name, image and likeness) take is estimated at US$3.1 million. And Bronny James (son of the NBA superstar LeBron James) of the University of Southern California joined the Nike family at the same time as Clark – his estimated overall NIL 2024 sponsorship deal is a little more than US$7 million. Nike shares were trading at just under 94-dollars US. Additionally, as of March 27, Clark was reportedly offered US$5 million (a historic offer) from rapper and Big 3 professional basketball league founder Ice Cube to join the league. DraftKings Inc. NASDAQ: DKNG No doubt, big bucks to will be spent during March Madness. Americans will bet more than US$2.7 billion on the tournament, according to the American Gaming Association. Roughly twice the amount legally wagered on this year&CloseCurlyQuote;s Super Bowl. Popular sports books include FanDuel and BET MGM, as well as one of the earliest entrants to the sports betting scene, DraftKings .

The company has a market cap of US$22.3 billion and company shares were last trading at a little more than US$47.20. Walt Disney Co. NYSE:DIS Disney is positioned as a direct competitor of DraftKings after its deal with Penn Entertainment in August. Disney&CloseCurlyQuote;s ESPN signed a US$2 billion deal to rebrand and relaunch Penn&CloseCurlyQuote;s sports book as ESPN Bet. It is not available in Canada, although Penn-owned theScore Bet looks the same and operates in Ontario. With Disney, investors are exposed to a diversified portfolio. The stock has struggled a bit since the pandemic, and the company is beginning to make money on streaming. Disney CEO Bob Iger recently updated investors on the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s performance, noting that Disney is trending ahead of cash-flow guidance for 2024. The stock trades at a forward price to earnings ratio of 24 and analysts believe earnings will grow by an average of 14 per cent annually over the next three to five years. Walt Disney Co. is trading at US$116.34. Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. NASDAQ:WB Disney competitor Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) established a permanent sports block on its networks March 11, just ahead of March Madness.

In line with this, Zambia is host to the Zambia-Congo copper belt, which features a geological environment conducive to large, high-grade and scalable copper deposits, including some of the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s largest. Within Zambia, the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s &NegativeMediumSpace;flagship target is called Dumbwa, located in the southeast portion of its Solwezi Project. Dumbwa is a tier-one exploration target featuring a 20-kilometre anomaly reaching grades of up to 0.73 per cent copper-in-soil. Midnight Sun Mining revealed in February that it had signed an earn-in agreement with KoBold Metals – which is an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven battery metals exploration and mining company – to explore the Dumbwa target. Midnight Sun and KoBold Metals partner on Dumbwa target In a news release, the company revealed that KoBold Metals will carry out systematic exploration of the Dumbwa target over a four-and-a-half-year period. KoBold Metals will spend US$15 million in exploration in addition to making cash payments totalling $500,000 over that period to earn a 75 per cent interest in the target. In an interview with The Market Online , Midnight Sun Mining&CloseCurlyQuote;s director of marketing and communications Adrian O&CloseCurlyQuote;Brien said the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s collaboration with KoBold is “huge.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; “We&CloseCurlyQuote;re going to be aggressively drilling and exploring and we&CloseCurlyQuote;re going to find out what Dumbwa really has,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; O&CloseCurlyQuote;Brien told The Market Online . Notably, Midnight Sun Mining&CloseCurlyQuote;s property is surrounded by the five biggest copper mines in Africa,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; he said of the nearby interests of First Quantum, Barrick, Rio Tinto, Anglo American and KoBold Metals. First Quantum&CloseCurlyQuote;s Kansanshi Mine, which is Africa&CloseCurlyQuote;s largest copper producer, is right next door to the company. “&NegativeMediumSpace;&NegativeMediumSpace;We look forward to KoBold applying [its] groundbreaking exploration approach to the Dumbwa Target and moving this important Zambian copper asset toward development together, which we view as perfectly timed to coincide with an upcoming phase of unprecedented global copper demand,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Al Fabbro, CEO of Midnight Sun Mining, said in a statement. The Dumbwa target Dumbwa is one of four key prospects composing Midnight Sun&CloseCurlyQuote;s 506-square-kilometre Solwezi Project which is located in the heart of the Zambia-Congo Copperbelt. Notably, Dumbwa features a continuous high-grade copper-in-soil anomaly that extends for more than 20 kilometres along strike and spans more than 1 kilometre in width with peak values of up to 0.73 per cent copper. Exploration work to date has included geochemical analysis and geophysics, indicating that systematic drilling guided by structural controls is the next step towards establishing continuity, size and scale of an underlying system. The Dumbwa Target area included in the KoBold agreement spans 108 square kilometres where KoBold expects to begin a drilling campaign sometime this year and begin a systematic exploration of structural targets at Dumbwa. The remaining 398 square kilometres of property that make up the Solwezi Project will remain with Midnight Sun, which expects to continue exploration on the other key targets outside of the area subject to the KoBold earn-in agreement. The joint venture agreement Once KoBold completes its earn-in agreement obligations, the two companies will form a separate company that will first be held by KoBold and Midnight Sun Mining, with each holding 75 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. The Dumbwa target will then be separated from Midnight Sun Mining&CloseCurlyQuote;s existing license into a new license and assigned to the joint venture company. Management and advisory board Midnight Sun continues to strengthen its team; case in point, on March 14, 2024, the company announced the appointment of Darin Wagner to their advisory board. Mr. Wagner is a Professional Geologist with extensive experience building and leading exploration stage companies, as well as guiding mineral exploration programs globally, and leading a number of M&A transactions. Mr. Wagner stated, “The recent agreement with KoBold Metals is a hugely significant milestone and shareholders should be excited about what this means for the project.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; The investment corner With Midnight Sun Mining&CloseCurlyQuote;s ideal location in the Zambia-Congo Belt – which is the second-largest copper-producing region of the world – the company is in a unique position compared with its peers to be game-changers in the copper space. As demand for copper is expected to reach unprecedented rates in addition to skyrocketing market prices in the coming years, companies such as Midnight Sun Mining will be in a prime position to fuel this growing market, making it a sound investment opportunity before the rush begins.

{"source_name": "Stockhouse Canada", "title": "A prime opportunity in the evolving lithium landscape", "title_link": "https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2024/03/18/a-prime-opportunity-evolving-lithium-landscape", "author": "Jonathon Brown", "Description": "Investors are fixed on the EV battery market to see what&CloseCurlyQuote;s next and one high-grade company has been standing out from the pack. Where are lithium investors putting their money? In a recent development that underscores the enduring value of lithium projects despite market fluctuations, Lithium Americas (Argentina) Corp. (TSX:LAAC) has sealed a significant agreement with a subsidiary of Ganfeng Lithium Co. Ltd., a major player in the global lithium market. The deal entails Ganfeng Lithium acquiring US$70 million worth of newly issued shares of Proyecto Pastos Grandes S.A. (PGCo), representing an approximate 15 per cent interest in the Pastos Grandes project located in Salta, Argentina. This transaction, valued at US$470 million, highlights the ongoing interest and investment in lithium ventures despite the recent downturn in lithium commodity prices. Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE: LAC TSX:LAC) of course is focussing on its widely acclaimed lithium resource, Thacker Pass Lithium Project , in Northern Nevada – which is said to be the largest known Measured and Indicated Lithium Resource in North America with 1,457.2 million tons of Measured and Indicated Lithium Reserves at an average of 2,070 Li (ppm) totalling 16.1 million tons of lithium carbonate equivalent. This agreement serves as a compelling reminder to investors that despite the current market conditions, transactions in the lithium space continue to be robust and hold substantial value. It also emphasizes the strategic importance of lithium assets, particularly those with significant potential for production and growth. Drawing parallels, this transaction prompts a comparison with companies also operating in Northern Nevada like Grid Battery Metals Inc. (TSXV:CELL) and their endeavors in the lithium sector at its Texas Spring Lithium Property, which borders Surge Battery Metals Inc.&CloseCurlyQuote;s (TSXV:NILI) Nevada North Lithium Project. Surge recently announced a mineral resource estimate of 4.67 million tons lithium carbonate equivalent grading 2,839 parts per million (ppm) lithium at a 1,250 ppm cutoff at its Nevada North lithium discovery. While Lithium Americas focuses on projects in both Argentina and Nevada, Grid Battery Metals focuses in North America with its three lithium projects in Nevada. Grid is making significant strides to develop these high value targets towards a viable lithium resource within North America. Grid Battery Metals&CloseCurlyQuote; Clayton Valley Lithium Project Grid Battery Metals&CloseCurlyQuote; work in the state, particularly its Clayton Valley Lithium Project, positions the company as a promising contender in the lithium market. Recently filing an NI 43-101 Technical Report on its Clayton Valley Lithium Project, Grid Battery Metals showcases its commitment to transparency and adherence to industry standards, enhancing investor confidence in its operations. (Source: Grid Battery Metals Inc.) “The recommendation for future exploration ultimately includes a drilling program as a logical next step here on the property. The timing is good for the company, and with approximately C$7.0 million in our treasury, we are well-positioned and fully funded for our 2024 exploration season,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; The company&CloseCurlyQuote;s president and CEO, Tim Fernback commented in a news release. “Clayton Valley holds the only producing lithium brine system in the United States and holds amazing potential for lithium clay-hosted deposits. Our lithium claims in Clayton Valley are bordering the Silver Peak Lithium Project of Albemarle Corp. (NYSE:ALB) , home to the only producing lithium mine in North America. Previously, Albemarle Corp. announced that it will continue to invest in its Silver Peak Lithium mine in order to double lithium production by the year 2025. Another neighbour of ours to the east, Century Lithium Corp. (TSXV:LCE) , has issued a pre-feasibility study referencing a 26 per cent after-tax internal rate of return and an NPV8 of $1.03 billion. Furthermore in May 2023,Nevada was ranked again as the #1 Mining Jurisdiction in the world by the Fraser Institute, a position it has held several times in the recent past. Our plan at Grid is to realize the potential of this area of Nevada for lithium-hosted brine and claystone for our shareholders.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; What sets Grid Battery Metals apart is the proximity of its Texas Spring Lithium Project to Surge Battery Metals&CloseCurlyQuote; Nevada North Project, known for its record high-grade lithium clay deposits, AND the proximity of its Clayton Valley Lithium Project to Albemarle&CloseCurlyQuote;s very active Silver Peak Lithium Mine. This geographical advantage places Grid Battery Metals in a prime position to capitalize on the burgeoning lithium demand, especially within the United States, a market poised for significant growth in the electric vehicle sector. In an update on March 13, 2024 , Grid announced the start of its 2024 exploration program as identified in the NI 43-101 technical report. Soil sampling will begin immediately and will be conducted by Rangefront Geoligical, a company with in-depth expertise and cutting-edge technology. A CSAMT survey will begin on March 18, 2024 conducted by experienced operator KLM Geoscience. Grid Battery Metals&CloseCurlyQuote; strategic location, coupled with its focus on high-grade lithium clay deposits, positions the company as a compelling investment opportunity. With the lithium market poised for resurgence and the increasing emphasis on domestic supply chains, Grid Battery Metals stands out as an undervalued player with significant growth potential. Investment corner With a market cap of just C$9.4 million, Grid Battery Metals appears to be undervalued in comparison to its peers, making it a compelling investment opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the growing demand for lithium. With a robust project portfolio, including the Texas Spring Lithium Project and Clayton Valley Lithium Project, and strategic positioning in proximity to key lithium assets, Grid Battery Metals offers investors a unique opportunity to capitalize on the growing demand for lithium in the renewable energy and electric vehicle industries. As the lithium market continues to evolve, Grid Battery Metals is poised to emerge as a key player, delivering value to shareholders in the long term.

{"source_name": "Stockhouse Canada", "title": "How to invest in home-building stocks", "title_link": "https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2024/03/20/how-to-invest-home-building-stocks", "author": "Jocelyn Aspa", "Description": "Canadian real estate continues booming, and home-building stocks are reaping the industry&CloseCurlyQuote;s continued growth benefits. Over the next four years, the country&CloseCurlyQuote;s real estate market is expected to grow by 3.89 per cent, resulting in a market volume of more than US$9.5 trillion. Fueling that growth will be an increase in demand and prices driven by low-interest rates and an increase in foreign buyers. In tandem with this, home-building stocks across the country also benefit from this growth. According to the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), housing costs for Canadians became almost unattainable in 2023. (Source: CMHC) However, as demand for housing continues to grow, so does the need for construction and, in turn, the companies behind it all. What are home-building stocks? Putting it simply, home-building stocks are essentially stocks of the companies that construct and sell residential properties. These companies build everything from houses and apartments to other residential structures, such as sheds and garages, and sell the properties to buyers. Like other industries, investing in home construction stocks means you&CloseCurlyQuote;re buying into a piece of the company, but the home-building industry is linked to the success of economic development and residential growth. What this means is that investing in these companies can be profitable. But it can also come with risks because of market fluctuations, resulting in changing share prices. How to invest in home-building stocks Investing in these companies isn&CloseCurlyQuote;t unlike any other, but if you&CloseCurlyQuote;re new to investing here&CloseCurlyQuote;s how to invest. Opening an online brokerage account If you don&CloseCurlyQuote;t already have one, the first step to investing in home-building stocks is opening a brokerage account. A brokerage account is an account that allows you to purchase investments such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds. Money can be added to the account from your bank account and be used to buy investments. Investing through an online trading platform These include ones through a banking institution or day-trading platforms such as Questrade or Wealth Simple in Canada Online trading platforms are essentially software systems used to trade securities and enables investors to trade, monitor, open, close and manage their stocks online. Investing through a bank Through your bank, open an investment account where you can choose from Canadian and U.S. stocks, common and preferred share s , new issues, options, rights and warrants, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and more. Investing through a financial advisor A financial advisor will offer advice on home-building stocks that best suit your needs and financial goals. Managing investments with a financial advisor can help alleviate the pressure of navigating the markets on your own especially if you&CloseCurlyQuote;re navigating new territory. One thing, in particular, to understand before investing in home-building stocks is how multi-layered the industry is with many moving parts. Within the home-building stocks industry are offices, residential sites, infrastructure as well as financing. Because of this, investors will want to truly consider what best fits their portfolio before investing. Important to remember, however, is the risk of investing that can include market risk, liquidity risk and concentration risk, among others. In other words, risk means the potential of losing the money you invest into your portfolio, so be as mindful as possible. A deep dive into home-building stocks Investing in home-building stocks is similar to other markets – some of the ways investors can do so is through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or stocks. ETFs are a blend of stocks and bonds that trade like similar stocks on an exchange. Exchange traded funds With that in mind, home-building ETFs in Canada include: iShares Global Infrastructure Index ETF (TSX:CIF) CIF provides investors with exposure to companies from around the world involved in the infrastructure sector, including transportation, water utilities and electricity services. As of the time of this writing, CIF has 10 holdings in its portfolio spread across industries such as industrials, energy and utilities. Its top three holdings include: Sterling Infrastructure (NASDAQ:STRL) Stantec (TSX:STN) NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG) BMO Global Infrastructure ETF (TSX:ZGI) This ETF offers exposure to publicly traded companies with more than 70 per cent of their revenues from infrastructure. ZGI currently has 50 holdings in its portfolio, including: American Tower (NYSE:AMT) Enbridge (TSX:ENB) National Grid (NYSE:NGG) AGFiQ Global Infrastructure ETF (NEO:QIF) Incepted in 2018 , QIF uses several factors to evaluate global infrastructure equities to provide investors with long-term capital appreciation with as little volatility as possible. Across its holdings include companies engaged in utilities, industrial, energy and real estate, among others. Enbridge Vinci SA (OTC:VCISF) Aena SME SA (OTC:ANNSF) Stocks No one-size-fits-all or one correct answer is available for which home-building and real estate stocks are the best because it depends on each investor&CloseCurlyQuote;s portfolio and what his or her long-term goals are. That being said, some companies that might intrigue investors include: WSP Global (TSX:WSP) WSP Global provides technical advice to a wide range of clients across different sectors, including transportation and infrastructure, earth and environment, property and buildings, power and energy and industry market sectors. The company also offers highly specialized services in project and program delivery and advisory services and operates in different segments: Canada, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa and Asia Pacific, which is composed of Asia, Australia and New Zealand. RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust (TSX:REI.UN) RioCan owns, manages, and develops retail-focused mixed-use properties with a portfolio ranging from leasing and development to residential. Its properties are held by tenants such as grocery, pharmacy, liquor, personal services and specialty and value retailers. Under its portfolio are 192 properties with an aggregate net leasable area of roughly 33.6 million square feet including office, residential and rental as well as 10 development properties. Stantec (TSX:STN) Stantec is a sustainable design and engineering company that provides comprehensive professional services in the area of infrastructure and facilities for clients in the public and private sectors. The company operates across Canada, the United States and other areas of the world, with services including engineering, architecture, interior design, landscape architecture, surveying, environmental sciences and project management among others. Canadian Apartment Properties Real Estate Investment Trust (TSX:CAR.UN) Canadian Apartment Properties Real Estate Investment Trust provides rental housing and owns and manages interests in multi-unit residential rental properties, including apartments, townhomes and manufactured home communities. The company owns approximately 65,000 residential apartment suites, townhomes and manufactured home community sites across Canada and the Netherlands. InterRent Real Estate Investment Trust (TSX:IIP.UN) InterRent Real Estate Investment Trust is focused on the acquisition, ownership, management and repositioning of strategically located, income-producing, multi-residential properties. The bottom line If investing in home-building and rental stocks sounds like it&CloseCurlyQuote;s up your alley, it&CloseCurlyQuote;s important to remember the market is still subject to market volatility. As such, don&CloseCurlyQuote;t put all your eggs in one basket. In other words, ensuring your portfolio is diverse is key, and choosing companies that fall in line with your values, among others, is important as well .

{"source_name": "Stockhouse Canada", "title": "Three of the best small-cap value stocks to buy in 2024", "title_link": "https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2024/03/15/three-best-small-cap-value-stocks-to-buy-2024", "author": " Trevor Abes ", "Description": "For a small-cap value stock to be called the best, it must demonstrate a considerable mismatch between market sentiment and its underlying company&CloseCurlyQuote;s chances at future success, including how long the good times might last, and exactly how much profit might end up in your pocket. Unlike broad market index funds, which offer exposure to the global stock market – which would only disappear in your lifetime in the event of a superhero-movie-scale disaster – management teams behind single stocks need to constantly worry about keeping their heads above water, as no brand is immune from competition and evolving consumer tastes. This is where value propositions come in. A value proposition delineates how a company intends to create positive change in its industry and turn a profit, whether it&CloseCurlyQuote;s extracting useful metals from the ground, developing gentler, more effective drugs, or introducing higher-efficiency technology into disciplines in need of modernization. It&CloseCurlyQuote;s by staying true to its proposition that a company creates optimistic market sentiment and generates shareholder value, though this process often occurs on a delay because of the macroeconomic worries of the day. Sometimes the market is too distracted to notice a company filling, or on the path to filling, an unmet need, causing the stock to swing on either side of fair value, granting investors attractive entry points poised for outsized long-term returns. Here are three of the best small-cap value stocks to consider under this thesis, each of which is creating value at a different stage of the journey from ideation to cash generation with little to no share-price recognition. Venture-stage value: Global Compliance Applications Global Compliance Applications (CSE:APP) designs and develops blockchain and machine-learning technologies that improve business outcomes. Efixii , its flagship product, is an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain and Ethereum Virtual Machine programming solution that connects producers, distributors, manufacturers and retailers through a decentralized value chain, enhancing data connectivity and the quality of customer decision-making. Efixii&CloseCurlyQuote;s specifications are on par with other leading Layer-2s, such as Polygon, while being cost-effective enough to accommodate businesses of any size that wish to establish the authenticity of their products. Clients can even institute rewards programs to pay customers with cryptocurrency for confirming a product&CloseCurlyQuote;s value or authenticity. Global Compliance also offers clearESG , a program that helps clients convey their sustainability goals and progress on the blockchain through a series of merit badges, as well as UPLIFT , a digital-coupon shop for cannabis and CBD products. By taking advantage of a blockchain&CloseCurlyQuote;s decentralized nature, which allows it to verify authenticity without the need for a middleman, Global Compliance is differentiating itself in the marketplace from legacy options that rely on trusted parties. In so doing, the company provides exposure to crypto and blockchain-based solutions that add value through services and produce revenue – as opposed to relying on sentiment-based price appreciation by directly owning crypto tokens – charting a course for other companies to connect digital assets with the traditional economy. Shares of Global Compliance Applications have fallen by 85 per cent since 2019, mostly because of the minimal revenue the company has been able to generate. That said, a management team steeped in decades of technology, Silicon Valley and Fortune 500 experience is broadening the reach of the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s technology suite amid massive crypto industry growth . Brad Moore, chief executive officer of Global Compliance Applications, spoke with Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Ryan Dhillon about the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s new partnership to bring its CBD and cannabis coupons to a wider audience. Turnaround value: Pampa Metals Our next pick for best small-cap value stock is Pampa Metals (CSE:PM) , a copper and gold explorer developing its 80-per-cent-owned Piuquenes porphyry project in San Juan Province, Argentina. Since optioning the project in November 2023, Pampa has engaged in ample and economical exploration, posting 130 m at 1.31 per cent copper equivalent in December 2023, followed by the discovery of a new zone of undrilled porphyry-related stockworks coincident with geophysical and geochemical anomalies in January 2024, and the extension of previous high-grade intersections in February 2023. Despite Pampa shares having given back more than 99 per cent of their value since 2014, this positive news flow is bolstering market sentiment and reversing some of those losses. Since acquiring Piuquenes, the stock has added 750 per cent, and benefits from a floor to add more thanks to numerous targets still to be tested, a tailor-made management team with decades of small-cap and large-cap mining experience, copper ‘s essential role in global electrification, and gold hovering near all-time-highs because of geopolitical tensions and expected interest rate cuts as global inflation normalizes. Joseph van den Elsen, Pampa Metals&CloseCurlyQuote; president and chief executive officer, spoke with Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Ryan Dhillon about the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s fourth announcement of highly prospective results since acquiring Piuquenes, including 304 m at 1.07 per cent copper equivalent. Balance-sheet value: Silvercorp Metals Our final small-cap value stock pick for the week is Silvercorp Metals (TSX:SVM) , which has earned its “best&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; designation by establishing a long track record of profitable mineral production. The Canadian company operating profitable mines in China has produced about 100 million ounces of silver and more than 1.3 billion pounds of zinc and lead since inception in 1996, with extensive drilling underway to unlock new mineralization and extend an estimated 15 years of remaining mine life. Over the past five years, which includes COVID, Silvercorp&CloseCurlyQuote;s efforts have translated into average annual net income of US$34.3 million, and more than US$87 million in operating cash flow year-over-year. Silvercorp&CloseCurlyQuote;s dependable cash flow has allowed it to pursue diversification into gold through the acquisition of OreCorp , whose Nyanzaga project in Tanzania is host to a well-delineated mineral reserve of 2.6 million ounces of gold (40.1 million tonnes grading 2.02 grams per tonne of gold). Unlike Pampa Metals and Global Compliance Applications, which have yet to make money and can only offer qualitative potential, Silvercorp is yielding cold, hard cash and can predict how its assets will perform with a fair degree of certainty, contingent on commodity prices, thanks to more than 2,600 km of drilling since 2014. Any stock that is pulling off this combination of profitability and predictability is an instant buy target, should it be trading at an unreasonable price, and that is certainly the case here with Silvercorp shares closely tracking the silver price since the 2008 financial crisis. This means the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s operations are not reflected in its stock price, despite their consistent profitability, offering new investors a chance at outsized returns should silver start to rise , which it&CloseCurlyQuote;s positioned to do. Lon Shaver, Silvercorp&CloseCurlyQuote;s president, joined Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Ryan Dhillon to discuss the latest updates about the OreCorp acquisition , and why the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s offer is superior to a competing bid from Perseus Mining.

For Canadians, who are increasingly embracing crypto, these principles are crucial in navigating the complexities of this new financial landscape. Trust in traditional financial systems is built on centuries of regulations, established institutions, and government backing. In contrast, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies poses a unique challenge: How does one establish trust in a system inherently designed to operate without central oversight? This question is particularly pertinent in Canada, a country known for its stable financial environment and prudent regulatory framework. In recent years, the Canadian crypto ecosystem has experienced a series of setbacks, underscoring the critical need for enhanced trust and transparency. These incidents have not only rattled investors but have also provided valuable lessons on the importance of these principles in the evolving world of digital finance. Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s journey with cryptocurrencies has been marked by notable events that have shaken the confidence of investors. High-profile cases, such as the collapse of QuadrigaCX, once Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, highlighted the vulnerabilities in the system. The mysterious circumstances surrounding the loss of funds due to the absence of regulatory oversight and operational transparency have led to a significant trust deficit among Canadian crypto users. What is Bitget doing differently? Established in 2018, Bitget is the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s leading cryptocurrency exchange with futures trading and copy trading services as its key features. Serving over 20 million users in more than 100 countries and regions, the exchange is committed to helping users trade smarter by providing a secure, one-stop trading solution. It also inspires individuals to embrace crypto through collaborations with credible partners, including legendary Argentinian footballer Lionel Messi, the leading Italian football team Juventus, and official e-sports events organizer PGL. According to Coingecko, Bitget is currently a top five futures trading platform and a top 10 spot trading platform. With a mission to restore trust in crypto globally, Bitget is setting an example that the industry can emulate. Proof of Reserves: Bitget&CloseCurlyQuote;s Proof of Reserves initiative ensures that 100% of users&CloseCurlyQuote; assets are backed with transparent monthly publications of its Merkle Tree proof, reserve ratios, and holdings in cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, USDT, and USDC. This is achieved by cryptographic verification methods and publicized wallet addresses, promoting transparency and security. Users can verify their holdings through an open-source code on GitHub, underscoring Bitget&CloseCurlyQuote;s commitment to transparency and asset safety. A reserve ratio exceeding 100% indicates the platform&CloseCurlyQuote;s capability to cover all user assets. Currently, the reserve ratio of 159%, and according to Coinmarketcap&CloseCurlyQuote;s data on March 5, Bitget&CloseCurlyQuote;s total reserves surpassed $2.244 billion consisting of major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, USDT, and USDC, among others. This routine audit provides clear visibility into Bitget&CloseCurlyQuote;s ongoing commitment to openness and accountability. “Bitget remains resolute in providing the highest level of security and transparency to its users. We prioritize financial stability and technical resilience to instill unwavering confidence in our platform. We take immense pride in maintaining the most robust reserve ratio among major exchanges. This unwavering commitment to financial stability reinforces our users&CloseCurlyQuote; trust in Bitget as a reliable and trustworthy crypto exchange.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; — Shaed Hashimkhial, GTM Lead at Bitget Security Fund: Currently standing at $580 million, Bitget stands as one of the largest self-insured funds in crypto. It builds trust amongst users with an extra layer of protection as it safeguards crypto assets against hacks, scams, and extreme market conditions. The Protection Fund is entirely self-funded, affording a high degree of operational flexibility and autonomy. It constitutes a robust financial shield intended to protect the financial interests of Bitget&CloseCurlyQuote;s users. This approach enables swift and efficient asset coverage without external red tape or the need for policy adjustments. The platform maintains transparency by providing seven wallet addresses that hold these assets, allowing users to track funds in real-time. This initiative further solidifies the organizations commitment to financial security and user trust. To further increase its stability and liquidity against external factors, the fund encompasses a diversified portfolio of high-liquidity cryptocurrencies such as BTC, USDT, and USDC. For the month of March, Bitget&CloseCurlyQuote;s Protection Fund has maintained stable growth as per market movements and BTC price surge, reaching an all-time-high value of over $580 million. The path forward for the Canadian crypto ecosystem involves learning from past mistakes and building a more secure and transparent environment. Emphasizing these values will not only help regain lost trust but will also ensure the sustainable growth of the crypto market in Canada. It&CloseCurlyQuote;s about creating a digital financial space where Canadians can engage with confidence, backed by the assurance of safety and clarity.

If you&CloseCurlyQuote;re unfamiliar, Reddit is essentially an online – and often chaotic – discussion forum where users, or “Redditors&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; share content that is socially curated and promoted by site members. With its headquarters in San Francisco, the website was launched in 2005 by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian and has grown to have more than 70 million users peruse its website daily as of 2023. Also in 2023, the website generated more than US$810 million primarily from advertising. In 2021 Reddit was already valued at $10 billion. Now that the online forum is gearing up to go public, here&CloseCurlyQuote;s everything you need to know about Reddit&CloseCurlyQuote;s IPO. Details of Reddit&CloseCurlyQuote;s IPO According to its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Reddit will be listing 22 million shares at a price between $31 and $34. It is estimated that it will raise between $473.6 million and $519.4 million from the sale of roughly 15.3 million shares. Existing Reddit investors will sell 6.7 million shares that will raise between $208.4 million and $228.6 million for their own portfolios, meaning those funds won&CloseCurlyQuote;t go to Reddit. As of Thursday, Reddit will have its shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the “RDDT&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; ticker symbol. How is Reddit&CloseCurlyQuote;s IPO different? Reddit is also selling roughly 8 per cent of the total offering to board members and alleged friends and family members of board members and employees. The SEC filing also says that users and moderators who created an account on or before Jan. 1, 2024, are potentially eligible for the directed share program, but must reside in the United States and be at least 18 years of age. Eligible users and moderators are also to be in good standing on the platform and cannot be current or former Reddit employees. These stock purchasers essentially won&CloseCurlyQuote;t be bound by the required period to hold onto their shares and will be able to immediately sell their stocks if they choose to do so. How have other social media IPOs done? Reddit is not the first social media platform to go public – in fact, far from it. Companies such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) – formerly Facebook, Inc., which includes Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp among others; Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP) and Twitter (now delisted after going private), have all previously raised significant IPOs. Case in point, Facebook went public in 2012 and, at the time, had one of the largest and most anticipated IPOs in history. On its first day of trading, Facebook shares closed at $38.23, above its $38 IPO price. Now, 12 years later and branded under the Meta Platform, shares of Meta are $496.24, representing a 1,198.04 per cent increase over that time. Formerly Twitter, X launched its IPO on the NYSE on Nov. 7, 2013, with the stock symbol TWTR and opened at $45.10. Twitter was a public company for only nine years, however, and was delisted from the NYSE in October 2022 after Elon Musk&CloseCurlyQuote;s acquisition of the social media platform. At the time of its delisting, shares of Twitter were trading at $53.70. Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP), an instant messaging multimedia platform, went public in 2017 and launched its IPO at $17 and closed its first day of trading at $27.90. It reached a high of $83.11 in September 2021 but has dipped significantly down to $11.05 as of Tuesday. Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) is another platform that had lots of buzz around its IPO when it went public in April 2019 at a valuation of $10 billion. Pinterest shares opened at $24.40 and reached a high of $85.31 in April 2021. As of the time of this writing, Pinterest shares sit at $33.89, representing a 38.89 all-time increase. The bottom line It is estimated that Reddit&CloseCurlyQuote;s IPO is between four and five times oversubscribed, which Reuters has reported makes it likely the platform will attain its $6.5 billion valuation. After its official launch into the stock market, it is projected the discussion platform will have roughly $1.5 billion in cash and equivalents, against no debt and relatively minimal other liabilities. Investors should keep in mind that oversubscription doesn&CloseCurlyQuote;t necessarily mean a strong performance in its stock market debut, but given the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s strong balance sheet its future is promising going forward. As always, however, investors are encouraged to do their own due diligence before making any investment decision.

According to Research and Markets , the global casino industry was valued at US$157.5 billion in 2022, and it will grow to US$224.1 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate of 4.5 per cent. This trend includes: Approximately 100 million gamblers in the United States , who generated US$66.5 billion in revenue in 2023 , a 10 per cent gain from 2022, which itself was a record year A little fewer than 20 million gamblers in Canada , who generated about C$15 billion in revenue in 2023 A global addressable market of thousands of casinos , and more than 4.2 billion people who gamble at least once every year, according to a 2016 study by Casino.org The main challenge with attracting these billions through casino doors is they sway heavily toward middle age. The mean age of U.S. casino visitors has hovered around 50 for the past decade , with a similar trend across the world, forcing casinos to attract younger, tech-savvy customers , many with less gambling experience, to continue growing profits for their stakeholders over the long term. Investors seeking exposure to a leadership position in building the bridge between casinos and the next generation of gamblers should evaluate Jackpot Digital (TSXV:JJ) . The Vancouver-based company is a manufacturer of dealerless electronic table games that deliver immersive experiences tailored to the digital age, while earning casinos attractive returns on investment. The gambling technology stock benefits from no direct competition in the dealerless poker space, with orders spanning North America, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean, a long-established presence with major cruise ship brands, such as Carnival, Princess Cruises and Holland America, and a growing land-based presence with orders or ongoing installations across 12 U.S. states. Its highlight partnership to date is a master services agreement with Penn Entertainment , the country&CloseCurlyQuote;s largest regional gaming operator with 43 properties across 20 states. Jackpot Digital&CloseCurlyQuote;s differentiated technology and well-rounded management team are at the heart of its success in landing several blue-chip casino gaming companies as customers. Jackpot Blitz The gambling technology stock&CloseCurlyQuote;s flagship product, Jackpot Blitz &circledR; , is a dealerless poker table featuring three of the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s most popular variations – Texas Hold &CloseCurlyQuote;em , Omaha , and Five-Card-Omaha – brought to life through slick 4k graphics on a 75-inch touchscreen, and offered in three formats – pot-limit, no-limit and fixed-limit – designed to attract a diversity of revenue from casual to experienced players. Spokesperson and NFL championship-winning coach Jimmy Johnson explains the benefits of the Jackpot Blitz. (Source: Jackpot Digital) The table also comes equipped with house-banked mini-games, including blackjack, baccarat and video poker, as well as side bets on the main poker game, such as Bet the Flop, all of which keep players engaged and entertained between, and even during, poker hands. The stunning Jackpot Blitz &circledR; machine also offers multi-venue “Bad Beat&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; jackpot functionality, allowing casinos to offer a “Poker Powerball&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; with massive Jackpots, further enhancing the attractiveness of Jackpot Blitz &circledR; to new players. It&CloseCurlyQuote;s by striking a balance between the needs of the modern gambler, and efficiency and profitability that in-person operators couldn&CloseCurlyQuote;t hope to match – unless they ordered the machine for themselves – that Jackpot Digital has earned itself the top spot in dealerless poker. Player benefits When a veteran or novice gambler takes a seat at the Jackpot Blitz, his or her experience begins with an easy-to-use interface, laid out in a modern and stylish design, programmed to respond to hand gestures that bring real casino play into the digital age, including card bending and chip jingling. Source: Jackpot Digital. The table&CloseCurlyQuote;s intuitive controls, combined with instant payouts and its dealerless nature, translate into faster game play, which maximizes playing time and player excitement, while minimizing human error and the intimidation new gamblers might feel about approaching an analog poker table. The gambling technology stock&CloseCurlyQuote;s in-house development team is also constantly working on new games to keep content fresh, with a special focus on bringing international games and regional versions of poker to casino audiences in Asia, South America and the Indian subcontinent. As hands are laid down and pots pile up, players can also track game stats in real time, which inform future strategy and enhance the thrill of the moment with an added element of competition. Operator benefits From an operator&CloseCurlyQuote;s perspective, a floor of automated gaming tables can meaningfully and instantly reduce casino staff expenditures and management pain points, while avoiding wage inflation, labour shortages and supply costs. The Blitz is no slouch on revenue either, dealing more hands per hour, resulting in higher revenue and higher profitability, which is further enhanced by onboard side bets and mini-games that can be played while players are engaged in a poker hand. The Jackpot Blitz&CloseCurlyQuote;s economics are attractive to operators thanks to its ability to accommodate non-stop play, while monetizing downtime through side games and bets. While a human dealer must spend time shuffling, interacting with players, and consulting with colleagues, the Jackpot Blitz can accept wagers 100 per cent of the time, making sure gamblers get the action they came for and operators see a return on their investment. Source: Jackpot Digital. Beyond gaming revenue, casinos are further incentivized to onboard the Jackpot Blitz because of its fully customizable advertising functions, including logos, card backs, chips and felt colors, all of which bolster casino culture and enable the pursuit of revenue from third-party advertising partners. The Blitz ties its value proposition together by generating automatic reports – including demographics and consumer behaviour through a rewards card system – and plugging directly into most back-end management systems, saving casinos the hassle of manual tracking, while also minimizing tampering, money-laundering and theft through the use of isolated servers. Whether it&CloseCurlyQuote;s streamlining the player experience or putting automation at the service of operators&CloseCurlyQuote; bottom lines, Jackpot Digital&CloseCurlyQuote;s flagship product is positioned to create value, and plenty of it. Jackpot Digital&CloseCurlyQuote;s path to profitability After existing as an exclusively cruise-ship-based operation since 2015, Jackpot Digital suffered a steep decline in revenue during the COVID pandemic, falling from C$2.18 million in 2019 to C$0.42 million in 2021. Management quickly pivoted in the face of uncertainty, redesigning the Blitz to execute on a land-based expansion strategy – backed by Gaming Labs International certification in fall 2023 – which is bringing about a successful turnaround after the re-emergence of the casino business. Revenue more than tripled to C$1.43 million in 2022, and reached C$1.57 million through three quarters of 2023, with the company expecting to ramp up significant recurring revenue after it installs several dozen machines currently in its backlog.

The first installation of land-ready Jackpot Blitz machines is now completed at the Jackson Rancheria Casino in California, as the company announced today . The three-machine installation marks a new era of growth for the company, having announced 25 Blitz deals since November 2021 (slide 12), with many more across Canada and the United States in the works, in addition to a strong pipeline in Asia and Europe. “Jackpot Digital could be a profitable company right now if it only focused on care and maintenance of the revenues it currently generates. But that&CloseCurlyQuote;s not why we&CloseCurlyQuote;re here,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Mathieu McDonald, Vice President of Corporate Development at Jackpot Digital, said in a recent interview with Stockhouse. “We intend to scale up to many multiples of the tables we have out right now, with the potential for up to 2,000 tables over the next three to five years.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; According to McDonald, the company is fielding three to five inquiries per week about the Blitz from casinos around the world that recognize the machines&CloseCurlyQuote; first-mover advantage in dealerless poker and potential expansion into other games in need of automation. Jackpot Digital&CloseCurlyQuote;s ambitious plan of action is supported by a management team of proven gambling, finance, advertising and legal professionals, many of which have been serving Jackpot stakeholders for more than two decades. A long-tenured management team The management team behind Jackpot Digital is led by Jake Kalpakian, who has served as president and chief executive officer since 1999, including under the gambling technology stock&CloseCurlyQuote;s former incarnation as Las Vegas From Home.com Entertainment Inc. Kalpakian brings more than 30 years of experience managing small-cap publicly listed companies, granting him a steady hand when it comes to maneuvering through the volatility of the economic cycle. Kalpakian&CloseCurlyQuote;s efforts are supported by three directors whose well-rounded expertise positions Jackpot Digital for long-term sustainable growth: Gregory T. McFarlane, a director at Jackpot Digital since 1999, previously ran an independent advertising firm and holds a degree in mathematics from the University of Toronto.

{"source_name": "Stockhouse Canada", "title": "Three quality fintech companies trading below fair value", "title_link": "https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2024/03/08/three-quality-fintech-companies-trading-below-fair-value", "author": " Trevor Abes ", "Description": "Allocators in the volatile small-cap and micro-cap space often benefit from stocks trading at steep discounts to existing operations, simply because investors cannot look past their unprofitability to fully comprehend their established and growing market positions. This phenomenon is especially notable with leading-edge technologies, whose markets have yet to build track records long enough to demonstrate reliable value creation. Fintech is a key example, with its long list of nascent innovations unlocking potential across the industry. Two fintech sub-sectors with extreme upside – financial education, and cryptocurrency and blockchain technology – are only beginning the climb in their growth trajectories, backed by generational tailwinds set to revolutionize how humans spend and save money, and companies keen to capitalize on these tailwinds by filling in market gaps. Here are three picks worth considering: Bitcoin Well First up, Bitcoin Well (TSXV:BTCW) , which operates a Bitcoin ATM network and online portal designed to bring modern banking convenience to the cryptocurrency. Current features beyond buying and selling include paying bills, dollar-cost average investing and buying gift cards, with more soon to follow. Given Bitcoin&CloseCurlyQuote;s US$1.3 trillion market cap, 21,000 per cent growth since 2015 to over US$68,000, recent splash in the ETF market , and the network&CloseCurlyQuote;s ability to execute transactions across the globe with no financial middleman, it is safe to assume that the cryptocurrency is filling an unmet need. Data from Statista supports this thesis, extending it to the industry at large, with growth forecasted at an 8.62 per cent CAGR from US$51.5 billion in 2024 to US$71.7 billion in 2028. Despite Bitcoin Well&CloseCurlyQuote;s 412.50 per cent return year-over-year, its 51.19 per cent loss since inception in 2021 indicates that shareholders are underappreciating crypto&CloseCurlyQuote;s presence in the economy by staying on the sidelines. All we have to do is look at how the industry&CloseCurlyQuote;s current market cap of US$2.6 trillion earns it third place among the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s largest stocks , while being roughly equivalent to all the U.S. dollars in circulation, to understand how inextricably embedded digital assets are in the global financial system. With Bitcoin online portal revenue up by 59 per cent from Q3 to Q4 2023, and unique users up by 368 per cent since Q2 2022 to 10,990, on top of fresh financing in Sept. 2023 and consistent gross profitability, there is nothing stopping Bitcoin Well from growing market share and fulfilling its mission of becoming a Bitcoin super company , where numerous subsidiaries specialize in different use-cases like remittances, sports betting and currency transactions. Adam O&CloseCurlyQuote;Brien, Bitcoin Well&CloseCurlyQuote;s founder and chief executive officer, joined Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Ryan Dhillon this week to shed light on the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s new loyalty program, Bitcoin Jackpot Contest, and collaboration with popular Bitcoin news and talk show, Simply Bitcoin. Continue your due diligence by reading Bitcoin Well&CloseCurlyQuote;s latest investor presentation . Hank Payments Hank Payments (TSXV:HANK) is a fintech company helping businesses and consumers build more value-accretive budget and payment systems. The company&CloseCurlyQuote;s products are diversified across auto, rental real estate, education, lending, fintech and financial advice, with about 300,000 consumer accounts on its platform producing a 91 per cent gross margin on recurring fees. Hank posted 27 per cent year-over-year revenue growth last quarter and expects to become cash and adjusted EBITDA-positive by the end of 2024, as new partnerships with the likes of FinWise Bank and a growing number of colleges are set to add to its approximately US$1 billion in managed balances. The company, at its essence, is an antidote to how 4 in 10 U.S. citizens can&CloseCurlyQuote;t cover a US$400 expense , and how only 6 in 10 own stocks . Its services are stemming the losses incurred from a lack of personal financial education across the U.S. school system, and ushering billions in capital off the sidelines by spreading the good word about how to make your money work for you. With the stock sitting at an 89.39 per cent loss since inception in 2021, and the company actively breaking through finance&CloseCurlyQuote;s perceived complexity, it&CloseCurlyQuote;s hard to see Hank as anything but undervalued. Mike Hilmer, Hank Payments&CloseCurlyQuote; chief executive officer, spoke with Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Brieanna McCutcheon about the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s new customer origination deal with FinWise Bank, which represents a new source of revenue from customer deposits. Continue your research by reading Hank Payments&CloseCurlyQuote; latest investor presentation . Banxa Holdings Our last, but not least, fintech stock pick for the week is Banxa Holdings (TSXV:BNXA) , an infrastructure company embedding crypto and blockchain technology into client platforms to do business in the new digital asset and Web 3.0 economies, where users don&CloseCurlyQuote;t depend on intermediary companies to make payments, take out loans, start businesses or establish trust among counterparties. Banxa&CloseCurlyQuote;s plan of action is that of Bitcoin Well, but from an institutional angle, acting as the rails for businesses that recognize the value of embracing crypto and blockchain through payment facilitation, NFT commerce, token listings and enabling fiat payments in smart contract protocols. The company&CloseCurlyQuote;s low fees and high conversion rates have seen it process billions in transactions since coming on the scene in 2014, as most recently highlighted by a 63 per cent increase in transaction volume to C$242 million in Q2 FY2024, up from C$149 million in Q2 FY2023, thanks to organic growth and new partnerships. The importance of the crypto economy , which now includes some 580 million people, is now impossible to ignore because of the independence its underlying blockchain networks – which have spawned tens of thousands of applications – offer everyday people who might otherwise be excluded from traditional financial institutions. And Banxa finds itself positioned to guide crypto&CloseCurlyQuote;s growth with a suite of tools that demystify the space and optimize its revenue potential. The company grew its own revenue by 10x from AUD$7.99 million in 2019 to AUD$80.35 million in 2023, with gross profitability growing by 10x as well to AUD$17.23 million, and recently achieved positive adjusted EBITDA in Jan. 2024, a trend it sees a good chance of continuing through the year. Holger Arians, Banxa&CloseCurlyQuote;s chairman and chief executive officer, spoke with Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Brieanna McCutcheon about the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s 2024 guidance, which bodes well for the stock to improve on its modest 20 per cent return since 2018.

One such company at the helm of the industry is Calgary, AB-based Voyageur Pharmaceuticals (TSXV:VM) , a company focused on developing barium, iodine and carbon-active pharmaceutical imaging drugs. Notably, Voyageur Pharmaceutical is gearing up to produce its own barium, iodine and fullerene minerals. In March, it revealed a partnership with Applied Pharmaceutical Innovation (API) that will undoubtedly transform Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s life sciences sector through the combined entities&CloseCurlyQuote; commitment to innovation. Voyageur Pharmaceuticals and API collaborate The company said in a press release that API will assist in accelerating Voyageur&CloseCurlyQuote;s imaging contrast medium product development, manufacturing and commercialization. Through API&CloseCurlyQuote;s scientific and pharmaceutical experience, the collaboration will work towards notching regulatory approvals and getting Voyageur&CloseCurlyQuote;s contrast imaging products to market in a timely fashion. “This strategic alliance with API will accelerate Voyageur&CloseCurlyQuote;s development programs, with a primary focus on creating a groundbreaking carbon-based MRI drug and advancing our iodine contrast media product pipeline,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Brent Willis, CEO of Voyageur Pharmaceuticals, said in a statement. Notably, the partnership will target the US Food and Drug Administration, Health Canada and other regulatory agencies by licensing across key development areas such as: Accelerating the development of the V@C60 MRI drug Developing novel fullerene imaging products for targeted drug delivery in the body, focused on applications in diagnosing disease. Introducing an advanced suite of new barium contrast media products, to displace current available products Expanding the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s lodine contrast media product pipeline, including the potential development of fullerene iodine products In an interview with The Market Online , Willis said that the partnership with API will allow the company to accelerate its drug program, and develop the carbon and other products it is working on. “The carbon C-60 molecule creates such a unique drug … because it creates an image that allows the doctors to distinguish between different tissues to identify the tumors and issues in the body by making it — in layman&CloseCurlyQuote;s terms — brighter in order to see better imaging,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; he explained. Rain Cage Carbon and Voyageur collaboration The company previously announced its licensing agreement with Rain Cage Carbon, a leader in carbon capture and reuse technology, to develop nanocarbon-based contrast drugs for medical imaging in May 2023. As part of the collaboration, Voyageur Pharmaceuticals believes Rain Cage has achieved a significant technological breakthrough with the pioneering EDEN™ system, a technology capable of directly capturing CO 2 and various other oxides from industrial emissions.

Carbon Farms is a multiple deployment of its proprietary Carbon Capture and Reuse technology, the EDEN™ System. The technology will transform CO 2 emissions into a crystallized form of carbon known as Advanced Carbon and is suited for applications within the renewable power generation and energy storage markets. “Our vision is to become the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s first company capable of creating new carbon-based drugs from captured CO 2 , ensuring carbon-neutral pharmaceuticals,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Willis said in a statement. The company believes producing carbon for Raincage will fund Voyageur&CloseCurlyQuote;s development as the economics are too promising to ignore. The investment corner Carbon-based drugs from captured CO 2 are undoubtedly set to be a game-changer in the life sciences industry, and Voyageur Pharmaceuticals is at the forefront of this innovation. As the company marches towards product development, manufacturing and commercialization, investors will be keenly watching to see how it will transform the industry and beyond.

One of those is Ucore Rare Metals (TSXV:UCU) , which recently reached a significant milestone in its working relationship with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), advancing its position in the rare earth elements (REE) market. The company successfully completed the second phase of its US$4 million transaction agreement at its commercialization and demonstration facility in Kingston, Ontario. This achievement marks a critical step forward in the development of Ucore&CloseCurlyQuote;s innovative separation technology. At the heart of this milestone is Ucore&CloseCurlyQuote;s 52-Stage RapidSX demonstration plant . The company utilized its 52-Stage RapidSX demonstration plant at its commercialization and demonstration facility and successfully separated mixed heavy and light REE chemical concentrate feedstocks, including mixed rare earth oxides and carbonates. By utilizing this plant, Ucore is positioned as a key player in the rare earth supply chain, providing vital materials for various industries, including defence, technology and clean energy. The partnership was announced back in June 2023 through its wholly owned subsidiary, Innovation Metals Corp., with two objectives to present to the U.S. DoD: The capability to commercially source a sustainable domestic (i.e., the U.S. and Canada) processing facility for converting heavy and light REEs feedstock sources to salable individual rare earth products. A new innovative separation process that increases the ability to create domestic REE processing plants. Dysprosium: A crucial element One of the notable elements separated by Ucore&CloseCurlyQuote;s technology is dysprosium. Dysprosium is a highly sought-after rare earth metal that plays a crucial role in modern technologies. Notably, dysprosium enables the production of rare earth permanent magnets capable of operating in high-temperature environments. These magnets are essential components in electric vehicle motors, wind turbines and other clean energy applications. Traditionally, the processing of dysprosium has been heavily concentrated in China, raising concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities. Ucore&CloseCurlyQuote;s ability to efficiently extract dysprosium and other REEs outside of China enhances supply chain resilience and strengthens strategic partnerships with the U.S. DoD and other key stakeholders. In addition to controlling 85 per cent of rare-earth processing, according to Politco, Reuters reported that China has also banned the export of technology to make rare earth magnets and technology to extract and separate critical materials. This is worth a look for national security and economic reasons. By reducing reliance on foreign sources for these critical materials, Ucore is helping to ensure a stable and secure supply chain for the United States and its allies. REEs are critical to many defence and commercial technologies, including those relying on rare earth permanent magnets to convert electrical to mechanical energy. Demand for these unique elements is expected to grow as the electrification of the worldwide vehicle fleet continues. About Ucore Halifax-based Ucore is focused on critical metals extraction, beneficiation and separation technologies and holds total control over the Bokan-Dotson Ridge Rare Heavy REE Project on Prince of Wales Island in Southeast Alaska. Investment corner The completion of the second milestone in Ucore&CloseCurlyQuote;s agreement with the U.S. DoD underscores the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s commitment to innovation and strategic partnerships. By successfully demonstrating its advanced separation technology, Ucore is in a solid position to capture a sizeable share of the growing rare earth market, particularly in the United States. Investors seeking exposure to the rare earth sector should consider Ucore Rare Metals Inc. as a compelling investment opportunity. With its cutting-edge technology, strong government support, and focus on critical elements such as dysprosium, Ucore is well-positioned for long-term growth and success. For investors looking to capitalize on the growing demand for REEs, Ucore Rare Metals Inc. presents a compelling opportunity. The company&CloseCurlyQuote;s innovative RapidSX technology, demonstrated at its Kingston facility, has the potential to revolutionize the rare earth separation process and establish Ucore as a leader in the industry. As Ucore continues to advance its partnership with the U.S. DoD and expand its operations, investors are encouraged to conduct their due diligence and consider the potential for long-term growth and profitability. Ucore stock has risen more than 12 per cent over the past three months.

In February, Electra Battery Materials (previously named First Cobalt Corp.) revealed that it had received a C$5 million investment from the Government of Canada to advance re-construction of its cobalt sulfate refinery in Temiskaming Shores, Ontario. This is on top of the C$10 million it received from the Canadian government in December 2020 , and an earlier US$45 million investment commitment from mining giant Glencore PLC (LSE: GLEN). Once fully operational, the facility will produce roughly 5 per cent of the global supply of battery-grade cobalt for electric vehicles and effectively pull supply away from China. In addition to the proposed supply agreement signed with Fuse Battery Metals , in 2021, Electra Battery Materials successfully signed another supply agreement with Glencore and China Molybdenum Ltd . to receive an additional 4,500 tonnes of cobalt hydroxide per year to refine into cobalt sulphate, thereby all but confirming its initial feedstock once operational. “Canada has surpassed China as the top jurisdiction in the global battery supply chain, given its strength in raw materials mining and processing,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Trent Mell, CEO of Electra Battery Materials, said in a Feb. 9 statement. “Today&CloseCurlyQuote;s announcement from the Government of Canada demonstrates its continued commitment to building a strong, domestic EV supply chain. We are grateful for this additional investment as it represents added validation of our progress and will allow Electra to continue to work toward our goal of producing secure, clean, and ethically sourced materials that are a crucial part of a sustainable future for electric vehicles in Canada.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Image credit: Fastmarkets In line with this, Electra Battery Materials revealed in July 2023 that its battery grade cobalt supply agreement with LG Energy Solution, a global manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries was extended and expanded from the initial terms that were first agreed upon in September 2022. Under the terms, Electra will supply LG Energy Solution with 3,000 tons of cobalt contained in a cobalt sulfate product in 2025 and a further 4,000 tons each year after until 2029 for a total of 19,000 tons supplied. “LG Energy Solution continues to strengthen its position as a global leader in the electric vehicle supply chain through its investments in Ontario and active collaboration with Canadian companies developing critical minerals and battery materials,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Mell said in a statement. Fuse Battery Metals&CloseCurlyQuote; MOU with Electra Fuse Battery Metals and Electra Battery Materials first entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in August 2022 related to a Cobalt Raw Material Supply Agreement. According to a release, the agreement is primarily focused on Fuse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Teledyne and Glencore Bucke Cobalt Exploration Projects in Cobalt, Ontario, and are in close proximity to Electra&CloseCurlyQuote;s cobalt sulfate refinery in Temiskaming Shores. “This MOU is the first step towards a potential definitive agreement to supply cobalt raw material for Electra&CloseCurlyQuote;s nearby cobalt refinery and sets out the terms by which we will exchange information with Electra to advance a potential transaction to involving the supply of cobalt raw materials,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Robert Setter, then CEO of Fuse Battery Metals, said in a statement. Perhaps most significant for Fuse Battery Metals is its close proximity to Electra Battery Materials&CloseCurlyQuote; cobalt sulfate refinery in Temiskaming Shores and the fact that their collaboration will assist in supplying the demand for onshore EV battery materials. As such, while the funding from the Canadian government is undoubtedly a win for Electra Battery Materials, it also is for Fuse Battery Metals. Case in point, Fuse Battery Metals entered into an option agreement to acquire up to a 100 per cent interest in the Teledyne project in 2016 and is subject to a 2 per cent net smelter royalty (NSR) on the Teledyne Cobalt Property. In spring 2018, Fuse amended and accelerated the option agreement and had earned a 100 per cent interest in the property with the vendors retaining the 2 per cent NSR. The property is ideally located in Bucke and Lorrain Townships and consists of five patented mining claims totalling 79.1 hectares and 46 unpatented mining claim cells totalling approximately 705.99 hectares. “For a bit of added perspective, our Ontario Cobalt Properties are located beside the former cobalt producing Agaunico Mine. From 1905 through to 1961, the Agaunico Mine produced a total of 4,350,000 pounds of cobalt, and 980,000 ounces of silver. The amount of cobalt produced from the Agaunico Mine is greater than that of any other mine in the Cobalt Mining Camp,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Tim Fernback, Fuse Battery Metals CEO, said in a statement . FUSE BATTERY METALS COBALT PROPERTIES – TELEDYNE and GLENCORE-BUCKE (Cobalt, Ontario) Image Credit: Fuse Battery Metals Benefiting from the Inflation Reduction Act In early 2023, Canada responded to the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States aiming at the country&CloseCurlyQuote;s climate and energy security. The Inflation Reduction Act actively encourages EV manufacturers to expand production in North America. The IRA incentivizes domestically sourced battery metals by aiming to provide billions of dollars in grants, loan programs and other investments for clean energy projects. “The Inflation Reduction Act removes any doubt that we can stick with the status quo. It has made the rush for innovation in clean tech more competitive than ever. Our transportation energy sector has been pivotal to Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s economic success for over a century. We have an opportunity to be a world leader in terms of clean fuel production while meeting Canadians&CloseCurlyQuote; evolving energy needs and climate goals,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s Environment and Climate Change Minister Stephen Guilbeault said in a speech. As companies like Fuse Battery Metals and Electra Battery Materials ramp up activities, the Inflation Reduction Act will be beneficial in not only reaching their goals but providing innovation as the move towards clean energy becomes more vital.

{"source_name": "Stockhouse Canada", "title": "Bank of Canada holds interest rate steady", "title_link": "https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2024/03/06/bank-canada-holds-interest-rate-steady", "author": " Trevor Abes ", "Description": "The Bank of Canada has held its policy interest rate at 5 per cent, where it has remained since July, in the absence of evidence that inflation is on a sustainable downward path Wages, shelter costs and measures of core inflation will likely need to fall before we see an initial interest rate cut High consumer prices and a slowing global economy have created opportunities in small-cap and micro-cap stocks, as investors look to preserve capital in less volatile instruments The Bank of Canada (BoC) has held its policy interest rate at 5 per cent , where it has remained since July, in the absence of evidence that inflation is on a sustainable downward path. The Consumer Price Index came in at 2.9 per cent in January 2024, down from 8.1 per cent in June 2022, driven primarily by a decline in gasoline prices and slower growth in grocery prices. This trajectory is in line with previous statements from Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem and his Governing Council, including the January 2024 interest rate announcement , about how the global economy is slowing, and that most advanced economies, including Canada, will reach their inflation targets by 2025. Canadian consumers have reduced spending because of high prices, while business investment has contracted, leading to normalizing unemployment and job creation. This dynamic allowed the BoC to surmise that the economy is operating in “modest excess supply&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;, according to the January 2024 announcement, which is welcome news for the prospects for lower prices. However, a number of factors are still contributing to the BoC&CloseCurlyQuote;s wait-and-see stance when it comes to instituting its first interest rate cut: Wages remain above inflation at a 4-5 per cent gain year-over-year. Shelter costs, which include rent, mortgages and housing-related expenses, were up by 6.2 per cent in January 2024, making them the largest contributor to above-target inflation. Measures of core inflation , which allow the BoC to strip out the more volatile components of the Consumer Price Index, have yet to show sustained declines. Until the tide turns on these factors, investors can expect continued downward pressure on stocks, especially small-caps and micro-caps with little to no revenue, whose assets are more likely to be overlooked by the broader market. Areas of interest include: Junior mining , where a broad-based disconnect between commodity and stock prices are offering investors a slew of entry points from 60 to more than 90 per cent below all-time-highs. Oil and gas , where robust reserves and profitable track records, like those of AKITA Drilling (TSX:AKT.A) and Saturn Oil & Gas (TSX:SOIL) , are carrying on with no market recognition.

{"source_name": "Stockhouse Canada", "title": "Gather 'round the crystal ball: A multi-commodity outlook from PDAC 2024", "title_link": "https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2024/03/08/gather-round-crystal-ball-a-multi-commodity-outlook-from-pdac-2024", "author": " Trevor Abes ", "Description": "TORONTO – Mining stocks, especially those in the exploration and development stage, are in the midst of a prolonged dip in sentiment, with many high-quality names down by more than 75 per cent from all-time-highs, despite global inflation having pushed commodities up over the past five years. It is these same inflationary forces, borne out of the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s re-emergence after COVID-19, that have pushed investors away from small-cap and micro-cap mining stocks, regardless of asset or operational quality, in exchange for the peace of mind of 3-4 per cent bond or savings yields, the highest since the 1990s, or owning physical commodities for their value preservation properties. Core from Canada Nickel Company&CloseCurlyQuote;s booth at PDAC 2024. The current environment is the most propitious to invest in junior miners since the mid-2000s, leading into the Great Financial Crisis, when the S&P 500 and TSX Index were almost cut in half, unleashing a flight to safety in gold and silver that propelled the metals to all-time-highs. Hundreds of companies that fit this thesis were in attendance this week at PDAC 2024 , the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s yearly convention to celebrate and expand Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s mineral resource industry. The convention – which ran from Sunday to Wednesday at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre – showcased enticing assets and experienced management teams from around the world, the majority of which have posted unjustifiably poor stock performances that should be ringing bells and whistles in value investors&CloseCurlyQuote; heads. Stockhouse compiled commodity outlooks from six such companies in attendance, whose bright futures across gold, silver, lithium, nickel, copper and uranium represent a robust, untapped opportunity for investors keen to diversify into the junior mining space. Founders Metals Founders Metals (TSXV:FDR) is developing its flagship 20,000-ha Antino gold project in Suriname. The company has posted high-grade results from Antino since optioning the project in 2021 – most recently highlighted by 19 m of 14.23 g/t gold , 15 m of 8.18 g/t gold and 26 m of 5.52 g/t gold , and the discovery of a new gold zone in February – dazzling shareholders with a more than 397.22 per cent return year-over-year as of Thursday. Founders is keen on continuing its track record of shareholder value, an outlier among the companies profiled in this article, with a fully financed 2024 drill program for up to 30,000 m, and an initial resource estimate with multi-million-ounce potential tentatively slated for Q2 2025. Commodity outlook: Gold Pascal Voegeli, Founders&CloseCurlyQuote; vice president of exploration, joined Stockhouse from the floor at PDAC 2024, commenting that “many of the macro fundamentals for gold are finally coming together. We&CloseCurlyQuote;re probably going to see a weakening in interest rates soon, which should be a major catalyst for price action, especially after we just surpassed the US$2,100 per ounce threshold and retail is starting to re-enter the market. Possible recessionary influences and 2023 being the largest in terms of central bank purchases also play in gold&CloseCurlyQuote;s favour.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; “Another supporting aspect is that a lot of the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s major gold mines are nearing depletion,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; he added, “and there&CloseCurlyQuote;s been a massive deficit in exploration spending over the past 10 years, pointing to how this finally might be a time when gold prices translate into the junior stock market.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Dolly Varden Silver Dolly Varden Silver (TSXV:DV) is developing its Kitsault Valley project in British Columbia&CloseCurlyQuote;s Golden Triangle, which houses the high-grade silver and gold resources of Dolly Varden and Homestake Ridge, and is considered prospective for more precious metal deposits. The project resides in the same geology as numerous other on-trend, high-grade deposits, including Eskay Creek and Brucejack , in an area that has seen more than $5 billion in M&A since 2018. The project is also home to the Big Bulk property, which indicates the presence of porphyry and skarn-style copper and gold mineralization. Kitsault ‘s latest mineral resource estimate stands at 34,731,000 indicated silver ounces, 165,993 indicated gold ounces, 29,277,000 inferred silver ounces, and 816,719 inferred gold ounces, with recent high-grade drilling likely to increase mineral inventories for the next estimate. The company is also 84 per cent owned by institutions and other companies, with a further 9 per cent with Eric Sprott, who is an institution all on his own, significantly de-risking the asset and management team for potential investors. Dolly Varden&CloseCurlyQuote;s stock, down by more than 40 per cent since 2014, has wallowed in obscurity, following silver&CloseCurlyQuote;s relatively flat return over the period. But with silver entering its fourth-consecutive year in a deficit , and a new C$15 million financing backed by Sprott to propel further exploration, shares are nearing a critical mass in terms of untapped upside. Commodity outlook: Silver Diana Zoppa, head of corporate communications for Dolly Varden, told Stockhouse that “my outlook for silver has been the same since my dad told me they went off the gold standard in the 1970s and everything was going to hell in a hand basket. It&CloseCurlyQuote;s real money, a store of wealth, and I think it&CloseCurlyQuote;s prudent for investors to accumulate bullion contingent on their financial goals and risk tolerance. I think we&CloseCurlyQuote;re at the beginning of a stellar bull market astronomically greater than any we&CloseCurlyQuote;ve ever seen because global debt and currency devaluation are astronomically greater than we&CloseCurlyQuote;ve ever seen. Central banks created hyper-inflation by overprinting fiat currency, we&CloseCurlyQuote;ve seen banks failing and problems in the derivatives markets, and silver, for me, is insurance against that.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Critical Elements Lithium Critical Elements Lithium (TSXV:CRE) is developing its flagship Rose lithium-tantalum project in Quebec, which features probable reserves of 26.8 million tonnes at 0.96 per cent Li 2 O equivalent, or 0.85 per cent Li 2 O and 133 ppm tantalum pentoxide (Ta 2 O 5 ). A 2023 feasibility study supports Rose&CloseCurlyQuote;s 17-year mine life, an after-tax NPV8% of US$2.195 billion, and an after-tax internal rate of return of 65.7 per cent, with average assumptions of US$4,699 per tonne of technical-grade lithium concentrate, US$2,162 per tonne of chemical-grade lithium concentrate, and US$150 per kg of Ta2O5. The price for a tonne of lithium averaged about US$3,800 in 2023, and is expected to continue falling until 2025 , when demand should catch up with an expected surplus in supply and resume course to doubling by 2030 . Rose will average more than 200,000 tonnes of spodumene production per year, with ongoing exploration set to grow that number with more high-grade discoveries , guided by a chief executive officer who has been with the company since 2009. Shares of Critical Elements Lithium have given back more than 75 per cent from their all-time-high in early 2023, serving up a potentially lucrative entry point as initial production at Rose ramps up in 2026. Commodity outlook: Lithium Eric Zaunscherb, chairman of Critical Elements Lithium, joined Stockhouse from the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s booth at PDAC 2024 to weigh in on the state of the global lithium market. “Obviously, we&CloseCurlyQuote;ve seen a big contraction in lithium prices . A big reason behind this is how the industry in indexed. Because there&CloseCurlyQuote;s a lack of transparency in the industry, with most lithium being transacted on a contract basis, the spot prices that people see aren&CloseCurlyQuote;t representative. We&CloseCurlyQuote;re also seeing a lot of de-stocking in the industry, particularly of lower-quality product in China, with the intention of driving the price of lithium down and minimizing competition . All of this leads to a very opaque market on the supply side. “On the demand side, the media focuses on the pullbacks we&CloseCurlyQuote;re seeing, particularly in North American OEMs. But the reality is that we&CloseCurlyQuote;re seeing other OEMs, especially in China, grabbing market share. I would suggest to you that growth is still extremely strong for EV demand, with massive downstream investments and off-take agreements to lock in lithium feed moving forward.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Canada Nickel Company Canada Nickel Company (TSXV:CNC) offers exposure to nickel-sulphide projects aiming to supply the growing stainless steel and electric vehicle markets. The company&CloseCurlyQuote;s flagship Crawford nickel-cobalt sulphide project in the Timmins nickel district boasts a bankable feasibility study supporting a US$2.6 billion NPV8%, free cash flow of US$546 million during its 27-year peak period, and total production of 1.6 million tonnes (Mt) of nickel, 58 Mt of iron, and 2.8 Mt of chrome over a 41-year project life. This makes Crawford the second-largest nickel reserve and second-largest nickel resource in the world. The company anticipates to receive final permits for Crawford in 2025, followed by construction in 2026, and first production in 2027. Canada Nickel owns multiple properties in the district, 11 of which have a larger footprint than Crawford with the same host mineralization. Recent highlights from these secondary opportunities include discoveries at its Mann Central and Mann Northwest . Backed by C$35 million in flow-through capital, management with deep mining financing and nickel exploration experience, and major investors, including Agnico Eagle (11 per cent), Samsung SDI (8.7 per cent) and Anglo American (7.6 per cent), the small-cap miner is on track to capitalize on its expectation that nickel demand will double by 2030 to more than 5 Mt per year, according to its corporate deck . Shares of Canada Nickel are up by only 64.44 per cent since inception in 2020, just ahead of nickel ‘s approximately 42 per cent gain over the period. Commodity outlook: Nickel Steve Balch, Canada Nickel&CloseCurlyQuote;s vice president of exploration, commented that his company is “very bullish on the price of nickel, despite its recent pullback, because there is huge demand and an overestimation of supply in both China and Indonesia. The nickel market is growing at roughly 9 per cent per year, and we expect that to continue as many existing projects are starting to shut down.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; “Canada Nickel has budgeted for between 90,000-100,000 m of drilling in 2024,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; he said, “with the goals of delineating seven new resources known to contain nickel, making seven new discoveries, and better positioning the company to meet EV and stainless steel demand.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Western Copper and Gold Western Copper and Gold (TSX:WRN) has been focused on bringing its Casino Project in the Yukon into production since 2008, a timeframe that speaks to the thoroughness of Canadian mining laws, as well as the vastness of the undertaking. Casino will be Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s largest critical minerals mine once extraction gets underway, including 7.6 billion pounds of copper measured and indicated and more than 3.1 billion pounds of copper inferred, and 14.8 million ounces of gold measured and indicated and more than 6.3 million ounces inferred, representing more than 80 years of combined supply. Casino is estimated to yield C$10 billion in after-tax cash flow over its 27-year life, according to a 2022 feasibility study , at conservative base-cases prices of US$3.60 per pound of copper and US$1,700 per ounce of gold, which represent 7.7 per cent and 21.15 per cent discounts, respectively, from Thursday prices on Trading Economics . Western Copper and Gold has established a responsible development track record at Casino (slide 40) since the initial acquisition, and the company is equipped to continue it with ongoing permitting efforts, supported by investments and expertise from mining heavyweights Rio Tinto and Mitsubishi , steadily growing copper demand through 2035, a long-tenured management team, and a new chief executive officer, Sandeep Singh, who oversaw 19 producing assets as president and chief executive officer of Osisko Gold Royalties. The Casino project&CloseCurlyQuote;s demonstrated value has yet to be reflected in WRN shares, which have risen by only 120 per cent since the company acquired the project in 2006. Commodity outlook: Copper Singh spoke with Stockhouse from Western Copper and Gold&CloseCurlyQuote;s booth at PDAC 2024, noting that his company sees huge upside in copper and gold prices. “I think that, over the next five to 10 years, there&CloseCurlyQuote;s going to be a good runway for both commodities. In terms of copper as a critical metal, there aren&CloseCurlyQuote;t enough projects moving forward around the world to meet demand from decarbonization and electrification, and we&CloseCurlyQuote;ve seen disturbances in major copper-producing countries such as Chile , Peru and Panama , which have put the supply chain at risk.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; “In terms of gold, when you look at it as a counter to the U.S. dollar, and as a hedge against inflation, I think it&CloseCurlyQuote;s a safe place to be,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; he added. “With gold near all-time-highs, I don&CloseCurlyQuote;t think the disconnect between stocks and the gold price is sustainable, and that will rectify itself when retail investors decide they want more levered gold exposure in world-class jurisdictions like the Yukon.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; CanAlaska Uranium CanAlaska Uranium (TSXV:CVV) is active across a 500,000-hectare exploration portfolio in Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s Athabasca Basin, the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s leading source of high-grade uranium, which produced more than 900 million pounds of high-grade triuranium octoxide since 1975, houses known resources of 606,600 tonnes, and offers ample room for further exploration. CanAlaska&CloseCurlyQuote;s properties including the high-grade West McArthur joint venture with Cameco and Moon Lake South joint venture with Denison Mines, as well as high-potential prospects for nickel, copper, gold and diamonds. The company has an aggressive drilling program planned for 2024 across five properties, with a highlight intersection of 16.8 m of 13.75 per cent uranium at West McArthur released on Feb. 28. It has paired ongoing exploration with an equally aggressive asset expansion plan, with three letters of intent and a property swap announced over the past two months. With the spot price of uranium up by 86.27 per cent year-over-year and by almost 400 per cent since 2019, and demand for the alternative fuel source expected to double by 2040 amid an ongoing deficit, CVV shares&CloseCurlyQuote; 144 per cent return since 2019 has a lot of room to run as the company develops one of the largest portfolios in the basin. Commodity outlook: Uranium Cory Belyk, CanAlaska&CloseCurlyQuote;s president and chief executive officer, joined Stockhouse to close out our commodity outlook roundup by shedding light on the future of uranium. “My expectation is pretty simple,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; he said, “it&CloseCurlyQuote;s that we&CloseCurlyQuote;re entering a whole new phase of nuclear build-out on a global scale across multiple decades because of smart modular reactor technology, including Microsoft&CloseCurlyQuote;s new nuclear division , and I expect the price of uranium to stay high and move higher as new projects come online.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; “Concurrently,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; he added, “CanAlaska shareholders can look forward to more assays and drill holes from our confirmed discovery at West McArthur over the next one to two months as we prepare to uncover new discoveries during the summer drilling season.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; A generational investment opportunity With currency devaluation poised to continue unabated, as central banks deploy the blunt instrument of interest rates, and the demand for critical minerals practically bound to the upside as oil fades from view, junior miners with demonstrated progress and limited market recognition – such as the sextet profiled above – are likely to remain a high-potential playing ground as decarbonization ramps up across the globe. The uncertainty surrounding how long this thesis will need to bear fruit, whether it&CloseCurlyQuote;s a year or a decade, and the extreme volatility to be endured along the way, given the nature of micro-cap stocks, are what will eventually separate those who reap exponential gains from those who settle for tax-loss harvesting.

Key factors include: Gold&CloseCurlyQuote;s millennia of history as a source of value acting as a hedge against inflation, which only returned below 3 per cent in Canada in January 2024 after surpassing 8 per cent in 2022, exacerbated by pandemic stimulus and global, vaccine-enabled returns to normality. The precious metal returned more than 530 per cent from 2000 to 2022. Robust central bank purchases in the pursuit of balance sheet stability and to offset monetary policy-induced fiat currency devaluation , with the institutions having been net buyers since 2010 to the tune of more than 7,800 tonnes. Gold&CloseCurlyQuote;s history making it a popular safe-haven during periods of market volatility, as well as times of heightened geopolitical risk , such as the present moment. While the metal has rewarded long-term investors with outsized returns, the same cannot be said for junior gold stocks, with the VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF yielding -68.89 per cent since 2009, and standout explorers dragged down with the riffraff, because of risk-off sentiment as high interest rates continue to put the brakes on the once white-hot post-pandemic global economy . It&CloseCurlyQuote;s precisely because junior gold stocks offer higher leverage to their target commodity thanks to an ability to generate profits from the otherwise yield-free metal, as well as the higher risk-reward trade off associated with companies in early-stage development, that retail and institutional investors have fled the space for safer assets. This has left experienced allocators to peruse the all-time-lows for unrecognized value. A key name to consider under this thesis is Goldshore Resources (TSXV:GSHR) , market cap C$23.37 million, an undervalued junior gold stock with a heavy-hitting management team, whose robust resource development at its 100-per-cent-owned Moss gold project in Ontario has been met with a 50 per cent drop in share price year-over-year, and an 86.15 per cent loss since drilling began in 2021 , severely discounting the miner against its peers, representing but the tip of the iceberg in a generational opportunity in the junior gold space. The Moss gold project Backed by extensive historical exploration dating back to the 1800s, and three years of high-grade drilling during Goldshore&CloseCurlyQuote;s recently completed 100,000 m campaign, the Moss gold project is composed of no less than 36 satellite targets prospective for gold, silver, copper, zinc and cobalt across a more than 35 kilometre mineralized trend. (Source: Goldshore Resources) Drilling is most recently highlighted by 1.34 g/t gold over 90.95 m (2022) and 2.17 g/t gold over 50.35 m (2023), with results as high as 6.30 g/t gold over 56.85 m (slide 24), and multiple high-grade structures to be explored in 2024 and 2025, including five promising gold trends identified during a summer 2023 field program . The project enjoys access to all the infrastructure required to support a district-scale mining camp, including readily accessible talent, water, natural gas, rail transport and cheap electricity priced at C$0.10/kwh, with the undervalued junior gold stock well-financed for further resource delineation. Moss&CloseCurlyQuote; 2024 mineral resource estimate Goldshore&CloseCurlyQuote;s history of economical drilling grades is most recently highlighted by a 2024 mineral resource estimate (MRE), which details an open-pit mining scenario at the Moss project&CloseCurlyQuote;s Moss deposit, and the East Coldstream deposit 13 km to the northeast, two structurally controlled targets with a combined 5.7 km of modelled strike length. The MRE – which relied on 538 drill holes that intersected the Moss deposit, and 156 that intersected the East Coldstream deposit – estimates the deposits to contain: Indicated mineral resources of 1.535 million oz. grading 1.23 grams per tonne gold (g/t Au) within 38.96 million tonnes, representing 23 per cent of total resources. Inferred mineral resources of 5.198 million oz. grading 1.11 g/t Au within 146.24 million tonnes. These include 3.35 million oz. of high-grade gold grading 1.84 g/t gold, and represent an overall grade increase of 11 per cent compared with the 2023 MRE , which estimated an inferred resource of 6 million oz. of gold grading 1.02 g/t gold. Preliminary metallurgical results came in at a spectacular 93 per cent gold recovery for the Moss deposit and 98 per cent for the East Coldstream deposit using a flotation-regrind-leach process, including gold recoveries between 53-64 per cent supporting a low-recovery heap leach solution for low-grade mineralization to bolster production and reduce tailings. The shears that contain Moss deposit mineralization extend well beyond the MRE&CloseCurlyQuote;s parameters, as historical drilling has intercepted gold mineralization over a total strike length of 8 km, which the undervalued junior gold stock validated during 2023 soil geochemistry and structural mapping . To date, the company has identified and modelled about 4 million tonnes of gold mineralization inside the conceptual open pit for future resource development on the road to another MRE slated for year-end 2025. Similarly, the shears in East Coldstream extend far below the reported MRE and are distinguished by a shallow easterly plunge tested at depth by Goldshore, with ample potential for additional gold mineralization. The MRE assumes a reasonably conservative sales price of US$1,850 per oz. of gold, creating just under a 10 per cent margin from the current price of US$2,019 as of Feb. 27, and uses improved modeling that shows 94 per cent of the tonnage (96 per cent of metal content) stem from high-grade gold-hosting shear zones, which is up from only 35 per cent in the 2023 MRE. The mining camp at the Moss project in Ontario. (Source: Goldshore Resources) The Moss and East Coldstream deposits encompass only a fraction of the entire Moss gold project, whose five aforementioned trends, as well as eight well-drilled candidates for resource development (slide 15), could mean millions in potential gold ounces to be discovered and efficiently brought to market. Considering the company has drilled less than 10 per cent of identified targets on its land package, all mineralized zones within the Moss gold project remain open to potential expansion, and plans are in place to relog and resample historical drill holes over the next few years, we support a recent statement by Peter Flindell, Goldshore&CloseCurlyQuote;s vice president of exploration, who believes that Moss is “ a much bigger mineralized system than is appreciated .&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; A tried-and-true management team Moss owes its prospective early-stage development to a team of mining industry veterans with shareholder-aligned interests, to the tune of 26 per cent insider ownership, and development and production experience that spans the mining life cycle from beginning to end. Brett Richards, Goldshore&CloseCurlyQuote;s interim chief executive officer, has built a more than 34-year career in mining and metals across financing, development, senior level operations and M&A, including stints as CEO of Roxgold and a senior executive at Kinross Gold and Katanga Mining. He views Moss as “a sector anomaly,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; according to the 2024 MRE news release , which will yield “top-quartile grade and top-quartile size and scale within its comparable peers.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Richard&CloseCurlyQuote;s leadership is complemented by Flindell&CloseCurlyQuote;s 35 years of experience in mineral exploration and feasibility studies, including leading teams through the discovery, development and expansion of numerous gold and copper mines in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, West Africa, Central Africa, Europe and Central America. His most notable tenures include 12 years with Newmont Mining, 11 years with Avocet Mining and eight years with Signal Delta. Keeping the books in order, Marlis Yassin, CPA, CA, Goldshore&CloseCurlyQuote;s chief financial officer, rounds off the senior management team with more than 15 years of experience working in her field across mining, technology and industrial companies, including senior finance management positions at public mid-tier mining companies and a long tenure at Deloitte providing reporting, advisory and assurance services to publicly traded natural resources companies. Goldshore&CloseCurlyQuote;s directors and strategic advisors are equally, if not more impressive in their laurels, as highlighted by director Joanna Pearson, the current CFO of the C$5.53 billion market cap Endeavour Mining (TSX:EDV) ; chairman Galen McNamara, the CEO of Summa Silver (TSXV:SSVR) ; and director Shawn Khunkhun, the CEO of Dolly Varden Silver (TSXV:DV) , who has raised more than US$1 billion in equity for resource companies over the past 17 years. Supported by strong drill and engineering results, as well as a seasoned executive team that knows how to build projects from the ground up, it&CloseCurlyQuote;s no surprise that Goldshore&CloseCurlyQuote;s value proposition has attracted 29 per cent institutional ownership, including Sprott (TSX:SII) , Wesdome Gold Mines (TSX:WDO) and Ninepoint Partners , de-risking allocations from retail investors. A stock with clear signals for considerable upside Goldshore stock&CloseCurlyQuote;s more than has caused Moss to be severely undervalued against comparable projects (slides 28-29) – such as Kinross&CloseCurlyQuote; Great Bear (2.7 million oz. M&I), B2Gold&CloseCurlyQuote;s Back River (6.3 million oz. M&I), Calibre Mining&CloseCurlyQuote;s Valentine (4 million oz. M&I), Mayfair Gold&CloseCurlyQuote;s Fenn-Gib (3.062 million oz. M&I) and Perpetua Resources&CloseCurlyQuote; Stibnite (6.034 million oz. M&I) – which trade or were acquired for anywhere between 6x and 81x Goldshore&CloseCurlyQuote;s market cap/mineral resources. Additionally, Moss&CloseCurlyQuote; resource grades are in the first quartile among peer open-pit projects near or in production (slide 31) – including New Gold&CloseCurlyQuote;s Rainy River, IAMGOLD&CloseCurlyQuote;s Côté Lake, Agnico Eagle/Yamana&CloseCurlyQuote;s Canadian Malartic, Argonaut Gold&CloseCurlyQuote;s Magino and Equinox/Orion&CloseCurlyQuote;s Greenstone – affording it a leading economic profile from an earlier development stage at an out-of-favour price. These price-value dislocation metrics, supported by gold&CloseCurlyQuote;s macro tailwinds, solid exploration and engineering results, and established leadership, are icing on the cake in our substantiation of a long-term investment in Goldshore. The undervalued junior gold stock&CloseCurlyQuote;s case is strengthened as it further expands mineralization and enhances its prospects for a re-rating through ongoing environmental baseline studies and another MRE slated for year-end 2025, followed by a preliminary economic assessment , eventual feasibility work, permitting and mine construction or an asset sale. Readers under-allocated to the mining sector would be best served by running Goldshore through a full due diligence process while market sentiment remains pessimistic, and entry points retain the potential for outsized returns.

{"source_name": "Stockhouse Canada", "title": "Across the mining lifecycle: An investing primer for PDAC 2024", "title_link": "https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2024/03/04/across-mining-lifecycle-an-investing-primer-for-pdac-2024", "author": " Trevor Abes ", "Description": "TORONTO – As the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) opens its doors for some 30,000 attendees at its 2024 convention, it&CloseCurlyQuote;s important for new investors to know how to evaluate projects at different stages of the mining lifecycle. According to British Columbia Mine Information , the mining lifecycle can be broadly divided into exploration, development and operation, with prospective stocks in each stage available to retail investors: Exploration-stage mining stocks A miner at the earliest stage must first prospect its land in search of a mineral deposit, often through airborne or ground-based surveys that provide geological and geoscientific information indicative of mineralized potential. Once a sufficiently anomalous piece of land is delineated, the miner will move on to more detailed exploration techniques, including sampling, diamond drilling and trenching, to determine the true extent of the deposit&CloseCurlyQuote;s size, shape and depth. If grades prove economical, more intensive drilling and bulk sampling may follow to produce a resource estimate and hone in on the best mining and processing techniques to optimize extraction and shareholder value generation. Because of their pre-revenue nature, exploration-stage mining stocks tend to exhibit higher volatility, reliance on market conditions and often dilutive funding to remain operational. This makes it common for these stocks to delist or experience complete losses because of bankruptcy or some black swan event , or benefit from rapid, multi-bagger growth should they make new mineral discoveries. One of the highest-potential exploration-stage companies attending PDAC 2024 is Midnight Sun Mining (TSXV:MMA) (Booth No. 2541) , which is exploring its 506-square-kilometre Solwezi project in the Zambia-Congo Copperbelt, the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s second-largest copper-producing region, a stone&CloseCurlyQuote;s throw from the largest copper mine in Africa, First Quantum&CloseCurlyQuote;s Kansanshi mine . Global mining leaders such as Barrick Gold, Glencore, Ivanhoe Mines and Rio Tinto are also active in the area. Solzewi includes two high-grade drill discoveries at Kazhiba and Mitu , both of similar geology and grade to surrounding operating mines, and a continuous 5 km EM anomaly in the Crunch zone with rock formations similar to Kansanshi. The property&CloseCurlyQuote;s flagship target, Dumbwa , contains a high-grade copper anomaly up to 0.73 per cent copper that extends over 20 km along strike and over 1 km in width. The target was recently optioned by KoBold Metals – a critical minerals explorer backed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures (initiated by Bill Gates), Andreessen Horowitz, T. Rowe Price and the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board – which can pay US$15 million in exploration (plus US$500,000 cash) over 4.5 years to earn a 75 per cent interest. Having worked on more than 60 projects across the world, KoBold&CloseCurlyQuote;s association significantly de-risks 2024 drilling at Dumbwa for prospective investors as copper barrels towards a long-term deficit . Al Fabbro, Midnight Sun&CloseCurlyQuote;s president and chief executive officer, spoke with Stockhouse from the PDAC floor to share fundamental lessons for new investors to the junior mining space. “Make sure that management has a technical and financial track record of taking on projects with good chances for success,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; he said, “and that they&CloseCurlyQuote;re not just attaching themselves to a hot sector or commodity.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; “New investors should also note that there&CloseCurlyQuote;s probably never been a better time to buy junior mining stocks,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; he added. “They&CloseCurlyQuote;ve never been beat up so badly and the sentiment has never been so poor, as commodity prices remain near record highs. The disconnect is so great that most junior stocks have falling-knife price charts, despite operational and managerial differences. It might be two months or two years before quality assets are recognized, but it feels like we&CloseCurlyQuote;re near a shift in sentiment.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Development-stage mining stocks A mining company with an enticing mineral resource estimate may then undertake a preliminary economic assessment, pre-feasibility study and feasibility study , in that order, to determine the viability of further development. The broad difference between the reports is their level of specificity, ranging from a margin of error of more than 50 per cent to as low as 10 per cent, covering a range of topics including engineering, legal, social, environmental and economic. In tandem with these reports, a miner will often take steps forward in terms of planning mine construction, operation, permitting and environmental assessment, taking into account how the life of the mine might change contingent on new discoveries and price fluctuations in its commodities of choice. Once the final permit is stamped and approved, the miner can then break ground and build up the structures it requires to begin ore extraction. Mining stocks with mines in development should be evaluated by their ability to stay on schedule and on budget, ideally while engaging in resource expansion, affording the market plenty of positive news flow to provide upward share price pressure. A shining example in this category is G Mining Ventures (TSX:GMIN) , a sister company of PDAC attendee G Mining Services (Booth No. 626) , the latter of which provides a comprehensive suite of mining project development services. G Mining Ventures&CloseCurlyQuote; 2-million-ounce Tocantinzinho gold project in Brazil is slated to deliver on commercial production in the second half of 2024, as first announced in September 2022, with GMIN shares having added 100 per cent year-over-year supported by new mineralization and consistent progress with construction. Michael Gignac, G Mining Services&CloseCurlyQuote; vice president of finance, spoke to Stockhouse about how development-stage mining stocks differentiate themselves in the marketplace, stating that investors generally want to allocate into “high-grade projects with robust reserves in stable jurisdictions with a strong degree of communal buy-in, ideally in areas where people have co-existed with mines for a very long time. Brazil is a quintessential example with its rich mining history , which Tocantinzinho is positioned to add to with its large land package.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Production-stage mining stocks The final stage in a mine&CloseCurlyQuote;s lifecycle – excluding decommissioning – involves commodity production, which should be propelled by management&CloseCurlyQuote;s skill at making the scenario delineated in the feasibility study a reality. Mining stocks that survive the more than 15-year journey from discovery to production are quite scarce, with less than 1 in 10,000 projects going on to become a mine , according to the Ontario Mining Association. Members of this exclusive cohort often earn a higher market capitalization than pre-revenue counterparts, given that they&CloseCurlyQuote;re likely turning a profit, offering investors more modest returns that can be estimated further out into the future. A compelling stock and PDAC exhibitor breathing this rarified air is Karora Resources (TSX:KRR) (Booth No. 2549) , a profitable gold miner executing a plan to double expected annual production to 200,000 ounces in 2024 compared with 2020. The company&CloseCurlyQuote;s Beta Hunt mine and Higginsville operations in Western Australia yielded record 2023 production of 160,492 ounces at all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of US$1,188/ounce through Q3 2023, in line with 2023 guidance of 145,000-160,000 ounces and US$1,100-US$1,250/ounce. Gold production has been comfortably above AISC since Q3 2022 (slide 10), signaling efficient operations, with 2024 guidance set at US$1,050 – US$1,200 AISC and 170,000-195,000 ounces. Concurrently, Karora has grown gold resources at Beta Hunt by 69 per cent since 2020 to 1.6 million ounces measured and indicated (M&I) – in addition to growing nickel resources by 44 per cent from 2020 to 22,300 tonnes M&I, gaining exposure to battery metals – with ongoing drilling substantiating significant expansion potential with solid gold and nickel grades. Higginsville, for its part, offers outsized exploration potential across an 1,800 square-kilometre land package, and a September 2023 mineral resource estimate of a little less than 1.6 million gold ounce M&I. Karora&CloseCurlyQuote;s exposure to lithium through its investment in Kali Metals further strengthens its growth potential by diversifying into a key component of electric vehicle batteries, a market slated to more than triple to moret than US$180 billion from 2023 to 2030. Backed by a robust untapped resource and expected production growth in 2024, Karora is well-positioned to continue its money-making ways, including three consecutive years of positive net income from 2020 to 2022 for a combined C$125.5 million, and an overall profitable 2023. Shareholders broadly agree, having pushed the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s share price up by more than 50 per cent since 2019. Rob Buchanan, Karora&CloseCurlyQuote;s director of investor relations, spoke with Stockhouse at PDAC 2024 to reflect on what it takes for a mineral producer to earn its place in investor portfolios. “From my point of view, what I like in a producer is profitability and prospects for growth,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; he said. “If you look at Karora&CloseCurlyQuote;s track record for production and resource expansion in Australia, our home base, we&CloseCurlyQuote;ve delivered on our growth plan year over year within cost guidance, despite floods, fires and a global pandemic, which speaks highly of the team we have put in place to manage our projects.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; “We&CloseCurlyQuote;re also looking at substantially growing our nickel resource and production,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Buchanan added. “We&CloseCurlyQuote;re currently generating about 500 tonnes of nickel per year as a by-product, with the intention of adding multiples of that figure over the next few years, supported by new discoveries and existing Beta Hunt infrastructure. Investors ought to favor well-managed companies like ours with ample growth potential, and extra drivers like nickel and lithium to add value, rather than a single project heading towards the end of its life.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; A parting proviso Whether your next mining stock only recently put drills in the ground, or is actively extracting a commodity, remember that markets only reward a good story for so long before demanding solid results to back up expectations. As you roam the PDAC halls, we encourage you to have conversations with companies across the mining lifecycle, but to listen with a critical ear and perform a full due diligence process before allocating any funds.

Mulroney underwent a heart procedure and was treated for prostate cancer in 2023. He had recently been in hospital to recover from a fall at his home in Palm Beach, Fla. The former prime minister began his career in 1964 as a labour lawyer in Montreal at what is now Norton Rose Fulbright, where he represented Iron Ore Company of Canada and Power Corporation of Canada. After a failed political leadership bid in 1976, he took control of the Progressive Conservative Party in 1983, and won the party a majority government in 1984, its first since the 1950s, coming in ahead of Pierre Trudeau&CloseCurlyQuote;s Liberals. Mulroney&CloseCurlyQuote;s tenure as prime minister, which lasted until 1993, is notable for his participation in the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States in 1988, a boon to Canadian exports and foreign investment, and the introduction of a goods and service tax in 1991 that helped to balance the government&CloseCurlyQuote;s books. NAFTA later was extended to include Mexico. In The Globe and Mail on Friday, Jon Hartley praised Mulroney for his free enterprise philosophy and push for deregulation and privatization. “His government privatized several Crown corporations such as Air Canada and Petro-Canada, further encouraging private sector investment and innovation. Canadians now have cheaper airfare and gasoline in part because of the privatization efforts conducted decades ago,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Hartley wrote. Mulroney also made an impact in global affairs beyond North America, speaking out against South African apartheid, leading relief efforts during the 1984 Ethiopian famine and becoming the first Western leader to recognize Ukrainian independence . Mulroney&CloseCurlyQuote;s government also secured the 1991 Air Quality Agreement with the U.S. to minimize emissions responsible for acid rain, paving the way for broader climate change agreements. A recession in the early 1990s led to the Progressive Conservatives&CloseCurlyQuote; ousting in 1993, leaving behind a steep deficit for new prime minister Jean Chretien to deal with, and allowing Mulroney to re-focus on the corporate world. After leaving public service, Mulroney took on a partner role at Norton Rose Fulbright, which he never left, as well as numerous executive positions at leading Canadian companies, where he continued his mostly spotless career in furtherance of Canadian economic interests. Barrick Gold Mulroney served as Barrick Gold&CloseCurlyQuote;s (TSX:ABX) director, senior advisor of global affairs and chairman of its international advisory board, which was instituted to provide advice to the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s board and management on geopolitical and other strategic issues. Blackstone He served as director for Blackstone (NYSE:BX) , the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s largest alternative asset manager, with over US$1 trillion in assets under management, approximately 12,500 real estate assets and over 230 portfolio companies. Iron Ore Company of Canada Mulroney was vice president of the Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOCC) in 1976 and president from 1977 to 1983. The IOCC is a consortium owned by Rio Tinto, Mitsubishi and Labrador Iron Ore Royalty that produces iron ore pellets and high-grade concentrate for the North American market. It has nameplate capacity to produce 23 million metric tons of concentrate per year, 12.5 million of which can be processed into higher-value pellets. Quebecor The former prime minister also spent over 20 years on the board of Quebecor (TSX:QBR.A) , serving as chair since 2014, helping to grow the company into a leader in Canadian telecom, media and sports and entertainment. “Mr. Mulroney has left his mark not only on Canadian history, but also the history of our corporation,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Pierre Karl Péladeau, president and CEO of Quebecor, said in a statement . “In the late 60s, he was a trusted advisor to my late father, Pierre Péladeau, and became an invaluable mentor to me. It was a privilege to be able to count on his vast experience and wisdom.

{"source_name": "Stockhouse Canada", "title": "Three undervalued mining stocks trading at all-time-lows", "title_link": "https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2024/03/01/three-undervalued-mining-stocks-trading-all-time-lows", "author": " Trevor Abes ", "Description": "Value investors new to mining stocks might be surprised to know that high-potential opportunities might appear as if they&CloseCurlyQuote;re worth avoiding, at least on the surface. This is because exploration-stage miners are almost always pre-revenue, meaning they depend on strong commodities markets and raising capital to fund their drilling programs, publish economical results and create shareholder value. It can be difficult for a new investor to take in all those zeros on a balance sheet&CloseCurlyQuote;s top line, above nothing but expenses, and feel convicted in the belief that a profit might one day be turned. Over the past few years, retail investors&CloseCurlyQuote; generally shaky hands when it comes to owning stocks, especially more volatile microcap stocks , have joined forces with high global inflation to create widespread undervaluation among junior miners, as more and more capital de-risks into the safety of bonds and cash. Many of these stocks are reflecting no market recognition of asset quality or development potential., including the trio I&CloseCurlyQuote;m presenting to you today, each of which is trading at an all-time-low: Star Diamond Star Diamond (TSX:DIAM) is a Canadian natural resource company acquiring, exploring and developing diamond properties. It holds an interest in the Fort à la Corne diamond properties in central Saskatchewan, in an area known for massive kimberlite volumes since an initial discovery in the 1980s. The properties are highlighted by the Star-Orion South diamond project , whose 2018 preliminary economic assessment details production of 66 million carats over 34 years at a net present value of $3.3 billion. The company is at work on a revised mineral resource estimate to enable a pre-feasibility study, which is expected within two years, to further solidify the opportunity for the marketplace. Sitting at a 61.36 per cent loss since 2019, despite an imminent deal to own 100 per cent of Fort à la Corne , Star Diamond has clearly been caught in the prevailing macro malaise and left for dead by retail investors, who are either unprepared or unwilling to hold the miner through the approximately 16.9-year journey from discovery to production . Large, high-profile institutional investors have been perfectly happy to step in, including Rio Tinto at 19.9 per cent and Newmont at 12.18 per cent. George Read, senior vice president of corporate development, spoke with Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Brieanna McCutcheon about the potentially value-accretive opportunity to practice carbon capture at Star-Orion. Max Resource Our next mining value stock pick is Max Resource (TSXV:MAX) , a mineral explorer focused on sediment-hosted copper. The company&CloseCurlyQuote;s flagship Cesar copper-silver project in Colombia resides along the Andean belt, the world&CloseCurlyQuote;s largest producing copper belt, with easy access to infrastructure developed by global majors Glencore and Chevron. Max Resource and partner Endeavor Silver are developing Cesar into a copper mine to fuel exponential growth in the energy transition , guided by the 20-km Uru copper silver zone (7 m at 8.5 per cent copper and 143 g/t silver), the 3.7-km Conejo copper-silver zone (average of 5 per cent copper), and the 32-km AM zone (grading as high as 34.4 per cent copper and 305 g/t silver). Exploration as of late continues to unearth high grades and delineate new targets , including two additional mineralized outcrops in 2024 at the AM-14 target, which lies along a 15-km trend that has graded as high as 24.8 per cent copper and 230 g/t silver. Brett Matich, Max Resource&CloseCurlyQuote;s president and chief executive officer, sat down with Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Coreena Robertson to discuss the new outcrops at AM-14. As Max continues to extend the copper-silver footprint at Cesar, its investors continue to leave en masse, causing the stock to give back more than 95 per cent of its value since 2019. This dynamic leaves seasoned allocators with a potentially exponential entry point worth their full consideration. Fokus Mining Our final mining value stock pick for this week is Fokus Mining (TSXV:FKM) , an active acquirer and explorer of precious metal deposits in Quebec. The company&CloseCurlyQuote;s flagship 2,865.54-ha Galloway gold project lies just north of the Cadillac-Larder Lake deformation, which houses numerous gold mines and deposits from Kirkland Lake, Noranda, Cadillac, Malartic and Val-d&CloseCurlyQuote;Or, and has yielded more than 100 million ounces over the past century. Fokus has identified numerous mineral occurrences in the western portion of its claims, including GP, Hendrick, Hurd and Moriss, affording Galloway a March 2023 mineral resource estimate of more than 1.4 million troy ounces of gold inferred. Drill results have been consistently positive across more than 40,000 m from 2020-2022, in addition to 2023 highlights of 33 m grading 1.20 g/t gold from the RB zone and 5 m grading 51.13 g/t gold from Moriss. Chief executive officer Jean Rainville spoke with Stockhouse&CloseCurlyQuote;s Brieanna McCutcheon about why the company is following up the Moriss highlight with a 1,250 m drilling program. The prolific nature of Galloway&CloseCurlyQuote;s mining district, the expansion potential across the project&CloseCurlyQuote;s main zones , and Rainville&CloseCurlyQuote;s more than 40 years of experience in finance and mining company leadership make Fokus&CloseCurlyQuote; almost 90 per cent fall from its all-time-high a compelling starting point for further investigation, especially as gold remains in record-breaking territory.

Case in point, the Vancouver-based oil and gas exploration company is in the process of executing Egypt&CloseCurlyQuote;s largest frack on the Badr Oil Field (“BED-1&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;) in the Western Desert. TAG Oil is in the middle of drilling the first horizontal well on the Badr Oil Field, the BED4-T100 (“T100&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;) well, whose Abu Roash “F&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; (“ARF&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;) formation in the BED-1 field is estimated to potentially host more than 500 million barrels of oil initially in place [1] . As the company looks to achieve the largest frack on Egypt&CloseCurlyQuote;s BED-1 Field, TAG Oil will also untether a unique investment potential in the space. The Egypt focus In an interview with The Market Online , TAG Oil CEO Toby Pierce explained that one of the biggest reasons the company has a focus in Egypt is because of Abby Badwi, the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s Executive Chairman and director. Pierce said Badwi is Egyptian-born and raised and has had four successful exits, two of which have been in Egypt. “We&CloseCurlyQuote;re hoping [TAG Oil] will be the fifth company sale,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Pierce said. As for what gives the company a leg up in the space, the company signed a Petroleum Services Agreement with Badr Petroleum company (“BPCO&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;) in 2022 to develop the ARF formation in BED-1 that spans a 107-square-kilometre concession in Egypt&CloseCurlyQuote;s Western Desert. BPCO is a wholly owned subsidiary of Egyptian General Petroleum Corp. Pierce explained the company is drilling an unconventional ARF reservoir, which is similar to the Eagle Ford Shale play in Texas. Notably, the Eagle Ford formation produces more than 1.2 million bopd, which is more than double what is produced in all of Europe. Putting it simply, what can be produced at BED-1 is nothing short of significant because of the potential to unlock a large amount of production within the region. “[Eagle Ford and BED-1 are] very similar in all attributes, and that&CloseCurlyQuote;s what gave [TAG Oil] the confidence to go after this source rock in Egypt,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Pierce told The Market Online, adding that no one else in Egypt is doing what the company is doing. Unleashing Egypt&CloseCurlyQuote;s largest frack on the Badr Oil Field (BED-1) Egypt has a vast and diverse economy that spans from oil and gas, mining and agriculture to the Suez Canal, tourism, and textiles – all of which are major contributors to the country&CloseCurlyQuote;s economy. In terms of oil and gas, Egypt is a net exporter of natural gas and produces roughly 700,000 bopd. Within the country, BED-1 was discovered by Shell back in 1982 and produced roughly 90 million barrels of light oil over a 30-year period from a region above the ARF. By 2012, BPCO had taken over control of BED-1. Current production is roughly 5,000 bopd, while the field has a 25,000-barrel processing facility. TAG Oil entered into the Petroleum Services Agreement in the BED-1 field in October 2022 and is currently in a Phase 1 evaluation period. The company revealed in February that it completed re-drilling from the intermediate cased section of the T100 well in BED-1, landing the casing liner in the ARF carbonate reservoir zone, and reaching a measured depth of 3,238 meters in the ARF. Image credit: Tag Oil Pierce explained that the company had previously undertaken the successful re-entry of the BED 1-7 vertical well back in May 2023, by conducting a fracture stimulation in the ARF formation. “The significance of that was that [the company] proved that the rock would take a frack of that nature in our horizontal well,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; he said. “&NegativeMediumSpace;&NegativeMediumSpace;While companies such as Apache (NASDAQ:APA) and others have undertaken smaller fracks in Egypt, nobody&CloseCurlyQuote;s ever done more than about 10 stages total.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Putting that into perspective, Pierce added that the company is planning to do roughly 25 to 35 stages in its portal of fracking. Getting to this stage, however, didn&CloseCurlyQuote;t come without its setbacks. “Through November and December, we had a couple of different well issues. The rig was causing us issues and that culminated with the well to bottom and collapse,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Pierce told The Market Online . He explained the company then took a pause and made some changes, including bringing in new drilling staff, changing the MUD system, and making repairs to the rig so the company could begin drilling again. “It&CloseCurlyQuote;s probably a very good testament to how the technical team responded to the challenge and overcame it,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Pierce said. Catalysts for TAG Oil Now that the company has commenced drilling the T100 horizontal pay zone section, it is expected to take roughly three weeks to complete drilling the horizontal section and run the completion technology. In the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s most recent update on February 21 the company stated that the horizontal pay zone section is expected to take up to approximately three weeks to complete, and Pierce noted that TAG Oil was roughly 100 metres into the horizontal drilling. Once all 1,000 metres are completed, the company will run a completion string and frackers in preparation for fracking. The drilling rig well then will be moved off the well site, allowing TAG Oil to proceed with the hydraulic fracture stimulation of the ARF. Moving forward, Pierce said catalysts that investors can look forward to will be news flow when the company expects to release flow test results out of the frack. TAG Oil is preparing for its second horizontal well expected to begin in late Q2 or early Q3 of this year. “[TAG Oil] is also looking at acquiring additional acquisitions of acreage in and around its existing acreage in Egypt,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Pierce said. The Management team Toby Robert Pierce, CEO and Director Toby Pierce is a natural resource executive with more than 25 years of experience in transactional and valuation deal sizes ranging up to $1.3 billion in valuation. Pierce&CloseCurlyQuote;s experience ranges from wellsite geology with Nexen and Burlington Resources , to director of oil and gas institutional research of Tristone Capital&CloseCurlyQuote;s Calgary and London offices. Pierce has also acted as CEO and president of Crest Petroleum. As a partner and oil and gas analyst for GMP Europe Securities LLP, Pierce covered a variety of oil and gas companies with market capitalizations ranging from $30 million to $15 billion and provided strategic advice and valuation expertise internally to the investment banking and sales partner. Pierce is a graduate of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto where he earned an MBA in finance and also holds a B.Sc. in earth sciences from the University of Victoria. Suneel Gupta, Vice President and COO Suneel Gupta is a senior executive in the international petroleum oil and gas industry with more than 30 years of experience and a successful track record of value creation in oil and gas. Gupta previously joined Bankers Petroleum in July 2004 as a founder and held several key roles with the company, including president and CEO, executive VP and COO, VP production & operations, VP business development and general manager for Albania. Gupta has been directly involved in growing the company from 500 bopd in 2004 to more than 22,000 bopd by 2014 and more than doubling booked reserves for the assets in Albania. Before joining Bankers Petroleum, Gupta held senior positions with several petroleum companies where he was integral to the development of oil properties in international countries as well as in Canada, including Husky Energy Inc., Renaissance Energy Ltd., Pinnacle Resources Ltd., and Chevron Canada Resources Ltd. Gupta holds a Bachelor and Master of Science in chemical engineering from the University of Calgary. Abdel (Abby) Badwi, Executive Chairman Abby Badwi is a geologist and petroleum industry executive with more than 40 years of international upstream experience, leading public and private energy companies with oil and gas assets in many international jurisdictions. Over the course of his career, Badwi has completed several corporate mergers and numerous corporate and asset acquisitions and has a strong capital markets following in North America and Europe. Badwi has been a corporate board member of several public and private companies, including Verano Energy in Colombia and Arpetrol Corp. in Argentina; both companies were successfully sold in 2014 and 2016. Badwi has also served as president and CEO of Kuwait Energy, which has operations in Egypt, Iraq and Oman, and successfully led the sale of the company in 2019. He has also been president and CEO of Bankers Petroleum, which has oil production operations in Albania, from 2008 to 2013. He was then vice chairman from 2013 until the company was sold in 2016. Badwi has also served as president, CEO and a director of Rally Energy from 2005 to 2007, a company with oil production in Egypt and natural gas in Pakistan, leading the company to its sale in 2007. The Investment corner As of the time of this writing, TAG Oil has a market cap of C$92.33 million, a share price of $0.48 and 184.66 million shares outstanding. Given the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s prime location in Egypt and that it is currently in the process of executing Egypt&CloseCurlyQuote;s largest frack on the BED-1 field, TAG Oil has a promising future with massive potential for investors to potentially capitalize on.

In November 1990 the Bull had a 160 per cent run for the longest duration of 90 months followed by a six-month, 32 percent loss The “economy&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; and the “stock market&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; are not interchangeable terms A “bull&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; and “bear&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; market describes the movement of stock markets up or down; however, it is important to understand that the stock market and the economy are not the same. The economy: The economy is a broader concept encompassing all activities related to producing, distributing and consuming goods and services within a given region or country. Stock market: The stock market is a subset of an economy – it is a platform where individuals and institutions can buy and sell shares in publicly traded companies, bonds, funds and more. Bull market A bull market is typically characterized as having a sustained increase in stock prices by at least 20 per cent over previous lows. With stock prices and other assets appreciating in value, investors tend to be more optimistic and confident as they see stock markets rising. Bull markets are typically influenced by factors such as a strong economy with low unemployment. This is when investors may profit from their investments; however, it&CloseCurlyQuote;s important to note that bull markets are not immune to market corrections. British investor, banker, fund manager and philanthropist Sir John Templeton in 1954 created the Templeton Growth Fund, which averaged growth of more than 15 per cent per year for 38 years. Templeton said, “Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism and die on euphoria.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Bear market A bear market, on the other hand, is where an index or asset shows a period of declining prices of 20 per cent or more from previous highs. Bear markets are typically driven by economic downturns, rising interest rates and/or geopolitical uncertainty. The good news is that, based on historical data, bull markets tend to be stronger and last longer than bear markets, meaning that periods of potential stock market gains typically outweigh periods of decline. How do we tell if we are in a bear or bull state? Simply put, stock prices are rising in a bull market and declining in a bear market. The stock market under bullish conditions is consistently gaining value, even with some brief market corrections. The stock market under bearish conditions is losing value or holding steady at lower prices. Brianne Gardner, wealth manager and financial advisor with Velocity Investment Partners at Raymond James says, “Identifying a bull or bear market involves analyzing various indicators, market dynamics, and investor behaviour. Rather than relying on a single indicator. … We closely monitor trends in indices such as the S&P500 and TSX, while also examining other indicators like VIX or gold price&CloseCurlyQuote;s trends to gauge market volatility and potential flight to quality. “ When was Canada in a bear or bull market? Canada&CloseCurlyQuote;s first bull market was in 1956 lasting five months and saw an 18 percent gain. It was followed by a bear market in July 1956 that lasted 17 months, registering a decline of 30 percent. in January of &CloseCurlyQuote;58 the bull went on a run for 18 months adding 39 percent. The bear followed, and was in charge for a year. In December of 1976 the bull was in the black for four years gaining a whopping 161 per cent followed by a decline in a bear market for 19 months at 44 percent. In November 1990 the bull had a 160 per cent run for the longest duration of 90 months followed by a six-month, 32 percent loss. In the 2000s – June 2008 to March 2009 – the bear roared because of the subprime lending crisis, while the bullish market ran March 2020 to April 2022 because of a large liquidity injection and an extremely low interest environment. Where are we now? For a look at 2024&CloseCurlyQuote;s bear or bull situation, Richard Carleton, CEO of the Canadian Securities Exchange and Gardner share their insight in, “Will we have a bear or bull market in 2024?&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; . Looking back, the TSX started 2023 on a strong note by rising 3.7 per cent in the first quarter, and it has fallen sharply since then mainly because of continued high inflation and rapidly rising interest rates. Gardner emphasizes that for short period examples, “We have been in a bear market in the previous two months,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; referring to September and October 2023. “In those two months the TSX went down 7 percent with negative returns in 24 out of 41 trading days in that period. Just the opposite happened in November. In its first three weeks (ending on Nov. 17) the TSX was up 6.9 per cent with positive returns in 10 out of 15 trading days, and the trend continues.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; In September 2023, CNBC polled about 300 chief investment officers, equity strategists, portfolio managers and CNBC contributors who manage money about where they stood on the markets for the rest of 2023 and beyond. The survey revealed that 61 percent believed it was a bear market rally, and 39 per cent thought we&CloseCurlyQuote;ve entered a new bull market. In a CNBC Interview in late December, Jay Hatfield, CEO of investment firm Infrastructure Capital Advisors said recent economic data “validates our theory that 2024 will be the year of rate cuts, and that&CloseCurlyQuote;s very bullish for stocks.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; A decline in rates worldwide should spell a good year for markets and less of a possibility of a recession, he told CNBC.
