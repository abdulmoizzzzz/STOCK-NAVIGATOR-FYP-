The last 30 days bring the annual gain to a very sharp 52%. Even after such a large jump in price, AdCapital may still be sending very bullish signals at the moment with its price-to-sales (or \"P/S\") ratio of 0.2x, since almost half of all companies in the Capital Markets industry in Germany have P/S ratios greater than 3.3x and even P/S higher than 13x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly reduced P/S. See our latest analysis for AdCapital DB:ADC Price to Sales Ratio vs Industry May 11th 2024 What Does AdCapital's Recent Performance Look Like? The recent revenue growth at AdCapital would have to be considered satisfactory if not spectacular. Perhaps the market believes the recent revenue performance might fall short of industry figures in the near future, leading to a reduced P/S. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour. Want the full picture on earnings, revenue and cash flow for the company? Then our free report on AdCapital will help you shine a light on its historical performance. Is There Any Revenue Growth Forecasted For AdCapital? AdCapital's P/S ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very poor growth or even falling revenue, and importantly, perform much worse than the industry. Taking a look back first, we see that the company managed to grow revenues by a handy 6.2% last year. The solid recent performance means it was also able to grow revenue by 12% in total over the last three years. So we can start by confirming that the company has actually done a good job of growing revenue over that time. Weighing the recent medium-term upward revenue trajectory against the broader industry's one-year forecast for contraction of 2.3% shows it's a great look while it lasts. With this information, we find it very odd that AdCapital is trading at a P/S lower than the industry. It looks like most investors are not convinced at all that the company can maintain its recent positive growth rate in the face of a shrinking broader industry. The Key Takeaway Shares in AdCapital have risen appreciably however, its P/S is still subdued. It's argued the price-to-sales ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator. Looking at the figures, it's surprising to see AdCapital currently trades on a much lower than expected P/S since its recent three-year revenue growth is beating forecasts for a struggling industry. We think potential risks might be placing significant pressure on the P/S ratio and share price. The most obvious risk is that its revenue trajectory may not keep outperforming under these tough industry conditions. At least the risk of a price drop looks to be subdued, but investors think future revenue could see a lot of volatility. It's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 3 warning signs with AdCapital (at least 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable), and understanding these should be part of your investment process. If strong companies turning a profit tickle your fancy, then you'll want to check out this free list of interesting companies that trade on a low P/E (but have proven they can grow earnings). Valuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand TUI AG ( ETR:TUI1 ). Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for TUI How To Calculate Return On Equity? The formula for return on equity is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for TUI is: 43% = €604m ÷ €1.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023). The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every €1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn €0.43 in profit. Does TUI Have A Good Return On Equity? One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, TUI has a superior ROE than the average (11%) in the Hospitality industry . XTRA:TUI1 Return on Equity May 11th 2024 That's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity? Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same. TUI's Debt And Its 43% ROE TUI does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.14. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it. Conclusion Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better. Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company . Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies. Valuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple.

KGaA (ETR:SAX) Estimates After Its First-Quarter Results", "title_link": "https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/media/etr-sax/stroer-se-kgaa-shares/news/analysts-are-updating-their-strer-se-co-kgaa-etrsax-estimate", "published_date": "May 11, 2024", "Description": "Ströer SE & Co. KGaA ( ETR:SAX ) last week reported its latest first-quarter results, which makes it a good time for investors to dive in and see if the business is performing in line with expectations. It was a credible result overall, with revenues of €453m and statutory earnings per share of €1.67 both in line with analyst estimates, showing that Ströer SE KGaA is executing in line with expectations. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year. See our latest analysis for Ströer SE KGaA XTRA:SAX Earnings and Revenue Growth May 11th 2024 Following the latest results, Ströer SE KGaA's ten analysts are now forecasting revenues of €2.10b in 2024. This would be a reasonable 7.1% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to jump 61% to €2.76. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of €2.10b and earnings per share (EPS) of €2.89 in 2024. The analysts seem to have become a little more negative on the business after the latest results, given the small dip in their earnings per share numbers for next year. It might be a surprise to learn that the consensus price target was broadly unchanged at €67.00, with the analysts clearly implying that the forecast decline in earnings is not expected to have much of an impact on valuation. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. There are some variant perceptions on Ströer SE KGaA, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at €77.00 and the most bearish at €60.00 per share. The narrow spread of estimates could suggest that the business' future is relatively easy to value, or thatthe analysts have a strong view on its prospects. One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. The analysts are definitely expecting Ströer SE KGaA's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 9.6% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 5.6% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 5.1% per year. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Ströer SE KGaA is expected to grow much faster than its industry. The Bottom Line The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates. Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have estimates - from multiple Ströer SE KGaA analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here. However, before you get too enthused, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Ströer SE KGaA that you should be aware of. Valuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple.

{"source_name": "Simply Wall St", "title": "Aurubis AG Just Beat Analyst Forecasts, And Analysts Have Been Updating Their Predictions", "title_link": "https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/materials/etr-nda/aurubis-shares/news/aurubis-ag-just-beat-analyst-forecasts-and-analysts-have-bee", "published_date": "May 11, 2024", "Description": "Investors in Aurubis AG ( ETR:NDA ) had a good week, as its shares rose 6.5% to close at €71.30 following the release of its second-quarter results. Revenues were €4.4b, approximately in line with expectations, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) performed substantially better. EPS of €1.88 were also better than expected, beating analyst predictions by 11%. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year. Check out our latest analysis for Aurubis XTRA:NDA Earnings and Revenue Growth May 11th 2024 Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Aurubis from eight analysts is for revenues of €17.3b in 2024. If met, it would imply a credible 4.3% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to jump 114% to €7.79. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of €17.8b and earnings per share (EPS) of €7.65 in 2024. So it looks like the analysts have become a bit less optimistic after the latest results announcement, with revenues expected to fall even as the company is supposed to maintain EPS. The average price target was steady at €76.78even though revenue estimates declined; likely suggesting the analysts place a higher value on earnings. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. The most optimistic Aurubis analyst has a price target of €90.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at €60.00. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation. Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Aurubis'historical trends, as the 8.8% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 is roughly in line with the 10% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 1.7% annually. So it's pretty clear that Aurubis is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry. The Bottom Line The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Regrettably, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, but the latest forecasts still imply the business will grow faster than the wider industry. Even so, earnings per share are more important to the intrinsic value of the business. The consensus price target held steady at €76.78, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets. Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider. We have estimates - from multiple Aurubis analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here. That said, it's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

It looks like quite a negative result overall, with both revenues and earnings falling well short of analyst predictions. Revenues of €362m missed by 16%, and statutory earnings per share of €0.82 fell short of forecasts by 27%. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results. Check out our latest analysis for SMA Solar Technology XTRA:S92 Earnings and Revenue Growth May 11th 2024 Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from SMA Solar Technology's six analysts is for revenues of €1.95b in 2024. This reflects a modest 2.7% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are expected to tumble 31% to €4.01 in the same period. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of €1.99b and earnings per share (EPS) of €4.44 in 2024. The analysts seem to have become a little more negative on the business after the latest results, given the small dip in their earnings per share numbers for next year. It might be a surprise to learn that the consensus price target was broadly unchanged at €60.00, with the analysts clearly implying that the forecast decline in earnings is not expected to have much of an impact on valuation. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. There are some variant perceptions on SMA Solar Technology, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at €70.00 and the most bearish at €48.00 per share. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure. Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry . We would highlight that SMA Solar Technology's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 3.6% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 15% p.a. growth over the last five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 8.3% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than SMA Solar Technology. The Bottom Line The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that SMA Solar Technology's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at €60.00, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.

What is concerning is that despite positive EPS growth, the share price has not tracked the trend in fundamentals. Shareholders may want to question the board on the future direction of the company at the upcoming AGM on 17th of May. They could also try to influence management and firm direction through voting on resolutions such as executive remuneration and other company matters. Here's our take on why we think shareholders may want to be cautious of approving a raise for the CEO at the moment. View our latest analysis for Dürr Comparing Dürr Aktiengesellschaft's CEO Compensation With The Industry At the time of writing, our data shows that Dürr Aktiengesellschaft has a market capitalization of €1.7b, and reported total annual CEO compensation of €2.9m for the year to December 2023. That's a notable increase of 22% on last year. While we always look at total compensation first, our analysis shows that the salary component is less, at €1.0m. In comparison with other companies in the German Machinery industry with market capitalizations ranging from €928m to €3.0b, the reported median CEO total compensation was €1.3m. This suggests that Jochen Weyrauch is paid more than the median for the industry. Moreover, Jochen Weyrauch also holds €604k worth of Dürr stock directly under their own name. Component 2023 2022 Proportion (2023) Salary €1.0m €1.0m 35% Other €1.9m €1.4m 65% Total Compensation €2.9m €2.4m 100% Talking in terms of the broader industry, salary and other compensation roughly make up 50% each, of the total compensation. Dürr pays a modest slice of remuneration through salary, as compared to the broader industry. It's important to note that a slant towards non-salary compensation suggests that total pay is tied to the company's performance. XTRA:DUE CEO Compensation May 11th 2024 Dürr Aktiengesellschaft's Growth Dürr Aktiengesellschaft's earnings per share (EPS) grew 65% per year over the last three years. In the last year, its revenue is up 7.3%. Overall this is a positive result for shareholders, showing that the company has improved in recent years. It's nice to see revenue heading northwards, as this is consistent with healthy business conditions. Historical performance can sometimes be a good indicator on what's coming up next but if you want to peer into the company's future you might be interested in this free visualization of analyst forecasts. Has Dürr Aktiengesellschaft Been A Good Investment? Since shareholders would have lost about 22% over three years, some Dürr Aktiengesellschaft investors would surely be feeling negative emotions. Therefore, it might be upsetting for shareholders if the CEO were paid generously. To Conclude... Shareholders have not seen their shares grow in value, rather they have seen their shares decline. A huge lag in share price growth when earnings have grown may indicate there could be other issues that are affecting the company at the moment that the market is focused on. If there are some unknown variables that are influencing the stock's price, surely shareholders would have some concerns. At the upcoming AGM, shareholders will get the opportunity to discuss any issues with the board, including those related to CEO remuneration and assess if the board's plan will likely improve performance in the future. While CEO pay is an important factor to be aware of, there are other areas that investors should be mindful of as well. That's why we did some digging and identified 1 warning sign for Dürr that investors should think about before committing capital to this stock. Important note: Dürr is an exciting stock, but we understand investors may be looking for an unencumbered balance sheet and blockbuster returns. You might find something better in this list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt. Valuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple.

So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results. There were no changes to revenue or earnings estimates or the price target of €74.83, suggesting that the company has met expectations in its recent result. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Stabilus at €88.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at €59.00. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure. Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. The analysts are definitely expecting Stabilus' growth to accelerate, with the forecast 20% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 7.5% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 4.2% annually. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Stabilus to grow faster than the wider industry. The Bottom Line The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates. Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Stabilus going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here. . Don't forget that there may still be risks.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, Bayerische Motoren Werke investors that purchase the stock on or after the 16th of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 21st of May. The company's next dividend payment will be €6.00 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of €6.00 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Bayerische Motoren Werke has a trailing yield of 5.9% on the current stock price of €101.60. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether Bayerische Motoren Werke has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for Bayerische Motoren Werke Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Fortunately Bayerische Motoren Werke's payout ratio is modest, at just 34% of profit. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out an unsustainably high 241% of its free cash flow as dividends over the past 12 months, which is worrying. Our definition of free cash flow excludes cash generated from asset sales, so since Bayerische Motoren Werke is paying out such a high percentage of its cash flow, it might be worth seeing if it sold assets or had similar events that might have led to such a high dividend payment. While Bayerische Motoren Werke's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were Bayerische Motoren Werke to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign. Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. XTRA:BMW Historic Dividend May 11th 2024 Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing? Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. For this reason, we're glad to see Bayerische Motoren Werke's earnings per share have risen 10% per annum over the last five years. Earnings have been growing at a decent rate, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year. The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Bayerische Motoren Werke has delivered 8.7% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders. To Sum It Up From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Bayerische Motoren Werke? We like that Bayerische Motoren Werke has been successfully growing its earnings per share at a nice rate and reinvesting most of its profits in the business. However, we note the high cashflow payout ratio with some concern. While it does have some good things going for it, we're a bit ambivalent and it would take more to convince us of Bayerische Motoren Werke's dividend merits. In light of that, while Bayerische Motoren Werke has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. To that end, you should learn about the 2 warning signs we've spotted with Bayerische Motoren Werke (including 1 which shouldn't be ignored) . If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks. Valuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple. Find out whether Bayerische Motoren Werke is potentially over or undervalued by checking out our comprehensive analysis, which includes fair value estimates, risks and warnings, dividends, insider transactions and financial health.

It was a credible result overall, with revenues of €377m and statutory earnings per share of €5.81 both in line with analyst estimates, showing that Knaus Tabbert is executing in line with expectations. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year. Check out our latest analysis for Knaus Tabbert XTRA:KTA Earnings and Revenue Growth May 11th 2024 Taking into account the latest results, Knaus Tabbert's six analysts currently expect revenues in 2024 to be €1.49b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of €1.49b and earnings per share (EPS) of €6.38 in 2024. So we can see that while the consensus made no real change to its revenue estimates, it also no longer provides an earnings per share estimate. This suggests that revenues are what the market is focusing on after the latest results. There's been no real change to the consensus price target of €67.33, with Knaus Tabbert seemingly executing in line with expectations. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Knaus Tabbert at €87.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at €44.00. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business. Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Knaus Tabbert's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 2.4% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 23% over the past three years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 3.8% annually. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Knaus Tabbert is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants. The Bottom Line The most important thing to take away is that the analysts reconfirmed their revenue estimates for next year, suggesting that the business is performing in line with expectations. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that Knaus Tabbert's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates. We have estimates for Knaus Tabbert from its six analysts out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 3 warning signs for Knaus Tabbert (2 are concerning!) that you need to be mindful of.

KGaA ( ETR:COP ) shareholders are probably feeling a little disappointed, since its shares fell 2.8% to €27.82 in the week after its latest first-quarter results. Revenues came in 2.1% below expectations, at €285m. Statutory earnings per share were relatively better off, with a per-share profit of €0.88 being roughly in line with analyst estimates. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year. View our latest analysis for CompuGroup Medical SE KGaA XTRA:COP Earnings and Revenue Growth May 11th 2024 Taking into account the latest results, CompuGroup Medical SE KGaA's ten analysts currently expect revenues in 2024 to be €1.24b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to bounce 76% to €1.69. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of €1.24b and earnings per share (EPS) of €1.78 in 2024. So it looks like there's been a small decline in overall sentiment after the recent results - there's been no major change to revenue estimates, but the analysts did make a minor downgrade to their earnings per share forecasts. The average price target fell 6.2% to €43.20, with reduced earnings forecasts clearly tied to a lower valuation estimate. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. The most optimistic CompuGroup Medical SE KGaA analyst has a price target of €64.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at €31.00. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business. Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that CompuGroup Medical SE KGaA's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 1.6% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 12% over the past five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 10% annually. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that CompuGroup Medical SE KGaA is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants. The Bottom Line The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that CompuGroup Medical SE KGaA's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. Furthermore, the analysts also cut their price targets, suggesting that the latest news has led to greater pessimism about the intrinsic value of the business. With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on CompuGroup Medical SE KGaA. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have estimates - from multiple CompuGroup Medical SE KGaA analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.

The early response was not positive, with shares down 6.3% to €17.00 in the past week. Results were roughly in line with estimates, with revenues of €505m and statutory earnings per share of €0.58. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on SAF-Holland after the latest results. Check out our latest analysis for SAF-Holland XTRA:SFQ Earnings and Revenue Growth May 11th 2024 Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus, from the five analysts covering SAF-Holland, is for revenues of €2.02b in 2024. This implies a small 5.3% reduction in SAF-Holland's revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to accumulate 9.3% to €2.09. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of €2.02b and earnings per share (EPS) of €2.01 in 2024. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates. The consensus price target was unchanged at €23.70, implying that the improved earnings outlook is not expected to have a long term impact on value creation for shareholders. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic SAF-Holland analyst has a price target of €31.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at €19.50. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await SAF-Holland shareholders. One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. These estimates imply that revenue is expected to slow, with a forecast annualised decline of 7.0% by the end of 2024. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 12% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 5.6% annually for the foreseeable future. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - SAF-Holland is expected to lag the wider industry. The Bottom Line The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around SAF-Holland's earnings potential next year. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at €23.70, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets. Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of €15.4b and earnings per share (EPS) of €0.90 in 2024. Although the revenue estimates have not really changed, we can see there's been a nice increase in earnings per share expectations, suggesting that the analysts have become more bullish after the latest result.

Currently, the most bullish analyst values Evonik Industries at €25.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at €17.00. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable.

By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 4.2% per year.

Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again. Less-covered, small caps sees more of an opportunity for mispricing due to the lack of information available to the public, which can be a good thing. So, could the stock still be trading at a low price relative to its actual value? Let’s examine LS telcom’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for LS telcom What's The Opportunity In LS telcom? Great news for investors – LS telcom is still trading at a fairly cheap price. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is €4.76, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, LS telcom’s share price is theoretically quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move to its intrinsic value, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta. Can we expect growth from LS telcom? XTRA:LSX Earnings and Revenue Growth May 11th 2024 Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of LS telcom, it is expected to deliver a negative revenue growth of -7.3% over the next couple of years, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Rheinmetall's shares on or after the 15th of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 17th of May. The company's next dividend payment will be €5.70 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of €5.70 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Rheinmetall has a trailing yield of approximately 1.1% on its current stock price of €535.80. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether Rheinmetall has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. Check out our latest analysis for Rheinmetall Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Rheinmetall paying out a modest 43% of its earnings. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It paid out more than half (54%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies. It's positive to see that Rheinmetall's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut. Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. XTRA:RHM Historic Dividend May 11th 2024 Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing? Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Fortunately for readers, Rheinmetall's earnings per share have been growing at 13% a year for the past five years. Rheinmetall has an average payout ratio which suggests a balance between growing earnings and rewarding shareholders. Given the quick rate of earnings per share growth and current level of payout, there may be a chance of further dividend increases in the future. Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Rheinmetall has lifted its dividend by approximately 30% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it. To Sum It Up Should investors buy Rheinmetall for the upcoming dividend? From a dividend perspective, we're encouraged to see that earnings per share have been growing, the company is paying out less than half of its earnings, and a bit over half its free cash flow. Rheinmetall looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely. Wondering what the future holds for Rheinmetall? See what the 14 analysts we track are forecasting, with this visualisation of its historical and future estimated earnings and cash flow Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers. Valuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple.

Revenues €947m disappointed slightly, at6.2% below what the analysts had predicted. Profits were a relative bright spot, with statutory per-share earnings of €0.52 coming in 12% above what was anticipated. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Carl Zeiss Meditec after the latest results. Check out our latest analysis for Carl Zeiss Meditec XTRA:AFX Earnings and Revenue Growth May 11th 2024 Following the latest results, Carl Zeiss Meditec's 15 analysts are now forecasting revenues of €2.22b in 2024. This would be a credible 7.5% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are forecast to dip 2.2% to €2.86 in the same period. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of €2.27b and earnings per share (EPS) of €2.92 in 2024. The analysts are less bullish than they were before these results, given the reduced revenue forecasts and the small dip in earnings per share expectations. The analysts made no major changes to their price target of €108, suggesting the downgrades are not expected to have a long-term impact on Carl Zeiss Meditec's valuation. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. There are some variant perceptions on Carl Zeiss Meditec, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at €150 and the most bearish at €68.00 per share. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business. These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Carl Zeiss Meditec's past performance and to peers in the same industry . It's clear from the latest estimates that Carl Zeiss Meditec's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 16% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 10% p.a. over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 7.0% annually. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Carl Zeiss Meditec to grow faster than the wider industry. The Bottom Line The biggest concern is that the analysts reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds could lay ahead for Carl Zeiss Meditec. Regrettably, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, but the latest forecasts still imply the business will grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at €108, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets. With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Carl Zeiss Meditec. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have estimates - from multiple Carl Zeiss Meditec analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.

Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year. View our latest analysis for 1&1 XTRA:1U1 Earnings and Revenue Growth May 11th 2024 After the latest results, the 13 analysts covering 1&1 are now predicting revenues of €4.20b in 2024. If met, this would reflect a modest 2.6% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to accumulate 5.8% to €1.82. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of €4.20b and earnings per share (EPS) of €1.81 in 2024. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results. There were no changes to revenue or earnings estimates or the price target of €20.89, suggesting that the company has met expectations in its recent result. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. Currently, the most bullish analyst values 1&1 at €32.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at €10.20. So we wouldn't be assigning too much credibility to analyst price targets in this case, because there are clearly some widely different views on what kind of performance this business can generate. With this in mind, we wouldn't rely too heavily the consensus price target, as it is just an average and analysts clearly have some deeply divergent views on the business. Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry . The analysts are definitely expecting 1&1's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 3.4% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 2.5% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 0.8% annually. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that 1&1 is expected to grow much faster than its industry. The Bottom Line The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates. Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider. We have forecasts for 1&1 going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here. Even so, be aware that 1&1 is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...

Although revenues of €16b were in line with analyst expectations, Siemens Energy surprised on the earnings front, with an unexpected (statutory) profit of €0.08 per share a nice improvement on the losses that the analystsforecast. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year. Check out our latest analysis for Siemens Energy XTRA:ENR Earnings and Revenue Growth May 11th 2024 Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Siemens Energy's 17 analysts is for revenues of €34.1b in 2024. This reflects a modest 6.7% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Siemens Energy is also expected to turn profitable, with statutory earnings of €1.34 per share. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of €32.9b and earnings per share (EPS) of €1.26 in 2024. So there seems to have been a moderate uplift in sentiment following the latest results, given the upgrades to both revenue and earnings per share forecasts for next year. It will come as no surprise to learn that the analysts have increased their price target for Siemens Energy 19% to €21.30on the back of these upgrades. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Siemens Energy, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at €32.70 and the most bearish at €11.40 per share. As you can see the range of estimates is wide, with the lowest valuation coming in at less than half the most bullish estimate, suggesting there are some strongly diverging views on how analysts think this business will perform. As a result it might not be a great idea to make decisions based on the consensus price target, which is after all just an average of this wide range of estimates. Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. The analysts are definitely expecting Siemens Energy's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 14% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 5.8% per annum over the past three years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 6.8% annually. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Siemens Energy to grow faster than the wider industry. The Bottom Line The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Siemens Energy's earnings potential next year. Pleasantly, they also upgraded their revenue estimates, and their forecasts suggest the business is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time. With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have forecasts for Siemens Energy going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.

{"source_name": "Simply Wall St", "title": "There's Been No Shortage Of Growth Recently For Daldrup & Söhne's (ETR:4DS) Returns On Capital", "title_link": "https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/energy/etr-4ds/daldrup-sohne-shares/news/theres-been-no-shortage-of-growth-recently-for-daldrup-shnes", "published_date": "May 11, 2024", "Description": "Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Daldrup & Söhne ( ETR:4DS ) so let's look a bit deeper. Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Daldrup & Söhne: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.065 = €1.6m ÷ (€36m - €12m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023) . Therefore, Daldrup & Söhne has an ROCE of 6.5%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Energy Services industry average of 9.6%. See our latest analysis for Daldrup & Söhne XTRA:4DS Return on Capital Employed May 11th 2024 In the above chart we have measured Daldrup & Söhne's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Daldrup & Söhne . What Can We Tell From Daldrup & Söhne's ROCE Trend? Daldrup & Söhne has not disappointed in regards to ROCE growth. The figures show that over the last five years, returns on capital have grown by 952%. That's a very favorable trend because this means that the company is earning more per dollar of capital that's being employed. Interestingly, the business may be becoming more efficient because it's applying 81% less capital than it was five years ago. Daldrup & Söhne may be selling some assets so it's worth investigating if the business has plans for future investments to increase returns further still. For the record though, there was a noticeable increase in the company's current liabilities over the period, so we would attribute some of the ROCE growth to that. Effectively this means that suppliers or short-term creditors are now funding 32% of the business, which is more than it was five years ago. Keep an eye out for future increases because when the ratio of current liabilities to total assets gets particularly high, this can introduce some new risks for the business. The Bottom Line On Daldrup & Söhne's ROCE In summary, it's great to see that Daldrup & Söhne has been able to turn things around and earn higher returns on lower amounts of capital. Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last five years the stock has only returned 2.0% to shareholders. So exploring more about this stock could uncover a good opportunity, if the valuation and other metrics stack up. On a separate note, we've found 3 warning signs for Daldrup & Söhne you'll probably want to know about. While Daldrup & Söhne may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity. Check out this free list here.

Shareholders will be interested in what the board will have to say about turning performance around at the next AGM on 17th of May. This will be also be a chance where they can challenge the board on company direction and vote on resolutions such as executive remuneration. The data we present below explains why we think CEO compensation is not consistent with recent performance. View our latest analysis for Stratec How Does Total Compensation For Marcus Wolfinger Compare With Other Companies In The Industry? Our data indicates that Stratec SE has a market capitalization of €507m, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as €1.0m for the year to December 2023. Notably, that's a decrease of 54% over the year before. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth acknowledging that the salary portion is lower, valued at €320k. On comparing similar companies from the German Medical Equipment industry with market caps ranging from €186m to €743m, we found that the median CEO total compensation was €807k. So it looks like Stratec compensates Marcus Wolfinger in line with the median for the industry. Component 2023 2022 Proportion (2023) Salary €320k €272k 32% Other €681k €1.9m 68% Total Compensation €1.0m €2.2m 100% Talking in terms of the industry, salary represented approximately 36% of total compensation out of all the companies we analyzed, while other remuneration made up 64% of the pie. It's interesting to note that Stratec allocates a smaller portion of compensation to salary in comparison to the broader industry. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance. XTRA:SBS CEO Compensation May 11th 2024 Stratec SE's Growth Over the last three years, Stratec SE has shrunk its earnings per share by 30% per year. Its revenue is down 2.9% over the previous year. Overall this is not a very positive result for shareholders. And the fact that revenue is down year on year arguably paints an ugly picture. So given this relatively weak performance, shareholders would probably not want to see high compensation for the CEO. Looking ahead, you might want to check this free visual report on analyst forecasts for the company's future earnings. . Has Stratec SE Been A Good Investment? The return of -61% over three years would not have pleased Stratec SE shareholders. Therefore, it might be upsetting for shareholders if the CEO were paid generously. To Conclude... Along with the business performing poorly, shareholders have suffered with poor share price returns on their investments, suggesting that there's little to no chance of them being in favor of a CEO pay raise. At the upcoming AGM, they can question the management's plans and strategies to turn performance around and reassess their investment thesis in regards to the company. CEO pay is simply one of the many factors that need to be considered while examining business performance. We identified 2 warning signs for Stratec (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here. Important note: Stratec is an exciting stock, but we understand investors may be looking for an unencumbered balance sheet and blockbuster returns. You might find something better in this list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt. Valuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple.

Results look to have been somewhat negative - revenue fell 5.1% short of analyst estimates at €1.5b, and statutory earnings of €0.46 per share missed forecasts by 2.6%. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Bechtle after the latest results. See our latest analysis for Bechtle XTRA:BC8 Earnings and Revenue Growth May 11th 2024 Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Bechtle from twelve analysts is for revenues of €6.79b in 2024. If met, it would imply a reasonable 6.3% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to accumulate 7.0% to €2.27. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of €6.93b and earnings per share (EPS) of €2.29 in 2024. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results. There were no changes to revenue or earnings estimates or the price target of €53.82, suggesting that the company has met expectations in its recent result.

There are some variant perceptions on Bechtle, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at €64.00 and the most bearish at €38.00 per share. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation. Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's clear from the latest estimates that Bechtle's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 8.5% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 5.4% p.a. over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 9.0% annually. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Bechtle is expected to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry. The Bottom Line The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Happily, there were no real changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow in line with the overall industry. The consensus price target held steady at €53.82, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets. With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have estimates - from multiple Bechtle analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here. It might also be worth considering whether Bechtle's debt load is appropriate, using our debt analysis tools on the Simply Wall St platform, here.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Accordingly, Amadeus FiRe investors that purchase the stock on or after the 16th of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 20th of May. The company's next dividend payment will be €5.00 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of €5.00 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Amadeus FiRe has a trailing yield of 4.4% on the current stock price of €113.40. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Amadeus FiRe can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. Check out our latest analysis for Amadeus FiRe Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Amadeus FiRe paid out 70% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It distributed 38% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies. It's positive to see that Amadeus FiRe's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut. Click here to see how much of its profit Amadeus FiRe paid out over the last 12 months. XTRA:AAD Historic Dividend May 11th 2024 Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing? Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. This is why it's a relief to see Amadeus FiRe earnings per share are up 8.8% per annum over the last five years. Decent historical earnings per share growth suggests Amadeus FiRe has been effectively growing value for shareholders. However, it's now paying out more than half its earnings as dividends. Therefore it's unlikely that the company will be able to reinvest heavily in its business, which could presage slower growth in the future. Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Amadeus FiRe has lifted its dividend by approximately 5.9% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders. Final Takeaway Is Amadeus FiRe worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share growth has been modest and Amadeus FiRe paid out over half of its profits and less than half of its free cash flow, although both payout ratios are within normal limits. Overall we're not hugely bearish on the stock, but there are likely better dividend investments out there. With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Amadeus FiRe and understanding them should be part of your investment process. A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see. Here you can find a full list of high-yield dividend stocks. Valuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple.

{"source_name": "Simply Wall St", "title": "retail investors who own 48% along with institutions invested in Nexus AG (ETR:NXU) saw increase in their holdings value last week", "title_link": "https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/healthcare/etr-nxu/nexus-shares/news/retail-investors-who-own-48-along-with-institutions-invested-4", "published_date": "May 10, 2024", "Description": "Key Insights Nexus' significant retail investors ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger public The top 25 shareholders own 46% of the company 42% of Nexus is held by Institutions If you want to know who really controls Nexus AG ( ETR:NXU ), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are retail investors with 48% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. While retail investors were the group that reaped the most benefits after last week’s 8.2% price gain, institutions also received a 42% cut. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Nexus, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Nexus XTRA:NXU Ownership Breakdown May 10th 2024 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Nexus? Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Nexus. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Nexus' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. XTRA:NXU Earnings and Revenue Growth May 10th 2024 We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Nexus. The company's largest shareholder is Luxempart S.A., with ownership of 10%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.3% by the third-largest shareholder. On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. Insider Ownership Of Nexus The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our data cannot confirm that board members are holding shares personally. Given we are not picking up on insider ownership, we may have missing data. Therefore, it would be interesting to assess the CEO compensation and tenure, here. General Public Ownership The general public-- including retail investors -- own 48% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. Private Equity Ownership With an ownership of 10%, private equity firms are in a position to play a role in shaping corporate strategy with a focus on value creation. Some investors might be encouraged by this, since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively, those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public. Next Steps: It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Nexus better, we need to consider many other factors. I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

There is an opportunity for shareholders to influence management to turn the performance around by voting on resolutions such as executive remuneration at the AGM coming up on 16th of May. We think most shareholders will probably pass the CEO compensation, based on what we gathered. View our latest analysis for Fresenius Medical Care How Does Total Compensation For Helen Giza Compare With Other Companies In The Industry? According to our data, Fresenius Medical Care AG has a market capitalization of €11b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth €5.5m over the year to December 2023. Notably, that's an increase of 72% over the year before. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth acknowledging that the salary portion is lower, valued at €1.7m. For comparison, other companies in the German Healthcare industry with market capitalizations above €7.4b, reported a median total CEO compensation of €8.7m. In other words, Fresenius Medical Care pays its CEO lower than the industry median. Furthermore, Helen Giza directly owns €533k worth of shares in the company. Component 2023 2022 Proportion (2023) Salary €1.7m €1.4m 30% Other €3.9m €1.8m 70% Total Compensation €5.5m €3.2m 100% On an industry level, roughly 42% of total compensation represents salary and 58% is other remuneration. It's interesting to note that Fresenius Medical Care allocates a smaller portion of compensation to salary in comparison to the broader industry. It's important to note that a slant towards non-salary compensation suggests that total pay is tied to the company's performance. XTRA:FME CEO Compensation May 10th 2024 Fresenius Medical Care AG's Growth Over the last three years, Fresenius Medical Care AG has shrunk its earnings per share by 25% per year. Revenue was pretty flat on last year. Overall this is not a very positive result for shareholders. And the flat revenue is seriously uninspiring. So given this relatively weak performance, shareholders would probably not want to see high compensation for the CEO. Looking ahead, you might want to check this free visual report on analyst forecasts for the company's future earnings. . Has Fresenius Medical Care AG Been A Good Investment? With a total shareholder return of -38% over three years, Fresenius Medical Care AG shareholders would by and large be disappointed. So shareholders would probably want the company to be less generous with CEO compensation. To Conclude... Given that shareholders haven't seen any positive returns on their investment, not to mention the lack of earnings growth, this may suggest that few of them would be willing to award the CEO with a pay rise. At the upcoming AGM, management will get a chance to explain how they plan to get the business back on track and address the concerns from investors. CEO compensation can have a massive impact on performance, but it's just one element.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward. We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model . See our latest analysis for KION GROUP Step By Step Through The Calculation We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF (€, Millions) €535.4m €673.6m €742.3m €799.5m €839.3m €870.3m €894.6m €913.9m €929.5m €942.6m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x9 Analyst x10 Analyst x7 Analyst x2 Est @ 4.98% Est @ 3.69% Est @ 2.79% Est @ 2.16% Est @ 1.71% Est @ 1.40% Present Value (€, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0% €496 €578 €590 €588 €572 €549 €523 €495 €466 €438 (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = €5.3b After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (0.7%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.0%. Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = €943m× (1 + 0.7%) ÷ (8.0%– 0.7%) = €13b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = €13b÷ ( 1 + 8.0%) 10 = €6.0b The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is €11b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of €45.0, the company appears quite undervalued at a 48% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. XTRA:KGX Discounted Cash Flow May 10th 2024 The Assumptions The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at KION GROUP as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.585. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for KION GROUP Strength Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry. Debt is well covered by earnings. Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows. Dividend information for KGX. Weakness Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Machinery market. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the German market. Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Threat Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow. Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the German market. Is KGX well equipped to handle threats? Looking Ahead: Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Not all shareholders will be feeling jubilant, since the share price is still down a very disappointing 16% in the last twelve months. In spite of the firm bounce in price, it's still not a stretch to say that AUTO1 Group's price-to-sales (or \"P/S\") ratio of 0.3x right now seems quite \"middle-of-the-road\" compared to the Specialty Retail industry in Germany, where the median P/S ratio is around 0.4x. However, investors might be overlooking a clear opportunity or potential setback if there is no rational basis for the P/S. See our latest analysis for AUTO1 Group XTRA:AG1 Price to Sales Ratio vs Industry May 10th 2024 What Does AUTO1 Group's Recent Performance Look Like? While the industry has experienced revenue growth lately, AUTO1 Group's revenue has gone into reverse gear, which is not great. Perhaps the market is expecting its poor revenue performance to improve, keeping the P/S from dropping. If not, then existing shareholders may be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on AUTO1 Group . How Is AUTO1 Group's Revenue Growth Trending? AUTO1 Group's P/S ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the industry. Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 15% decrease to the company's top line. However, a few very strong years before that means that it was still able to grow revenue by an impressive 75% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would definitely welcome the medium-term rates of revenue growth. Looking ahead now, revenue is anticipated to climb by 8.7% each year during the coming three years according to the eleven analysts following the company. With the industry only predicted to deliver 6.5% per year, the company is positioned for a stronger revenue result. With this information, we find it interesting that AUTO1 Group is trading at a fairly similar P/S compared to the industry. Apparently some shareholders are skeptical of the forecasts and have been accepting lower selling prices. The Final Word AUTO1 Group's stock has a lot of momentum behind it lately, which has brought its P/S level with the rest of the industry. Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-sales ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company. Looking at AUTO1 Group's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior revenue outlook isn't giving the boost to its P/S that we would've expected. There could be some risks that the market is pricing in, which is preventing the P/S ratio from matching the positive outlook. This uncertainty seems to be reflected in the share price which, while stable, could be higher given the revenue forecasts. Don't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for AUTO1 Group (1 is significant) you should be aware of.

However, what is unusual is that EPS growth has been positive, suggesting that the share price has diverged from fundamentals. These are some of the concerns that shareholders may want to bring up at the next AGM held on 17th of May. They could also influence management through voting on resolutions such as executive remuneration. Here's our take on why we think shareholders may want to be cautious of approving a raise for the CEO at the moment. View our latest analysis for SYNLAB How Does Total Compensation For Mathieu Floreani Compare With Other Companies In The Industry? According to our data, SYNLAB AG has a market capitalization of €2.3b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth €2.4m over the year to December 2023. Notably, that's a decrease of 14% over the year before. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth acknowledging that the salary portion is lower, valued at €1.0m. On examining similar-sized companies in the German Healthcare industry with market capitalizations between €1.9b and €5.9b, we discovered that the median CEO total compensation of that group was €1.8m. Hence, we can conclude that Mathieu Floreani is remunerated higher than the industry median. Component 2023 2022 Proportion (2023) Salary €1.0m €1.0m 42% Other €1.4m €1.8m 58% Total Compensation €2.4m €2.8m 100% Talking in terms of the industry, salary represented approximately 42% of total compensation out of all the companies we analyzed, while other remuneration made up 58% of the pie. Although there is a difference in how total compensation is set, SYNLAB more or less reflects the market in terms of setting the salary. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance. XTRA:SYAB CEO Compensation May 10th 2024 A Look at SYNLAB AG's Growth Numbers SYNLAB AG has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 150% a year over the past three years. It saw its revenue drop 19% over the last year. Shareholders would be glad to know that the company has improved itself over the last few years. The lack of revenue growth isn't ideal, but it is the bottom line that counts most in business. Historical performance can sometimes be a good indicator on what's coming up next but if you want to peer into the company's future you might be interested in this free visualization of analyst forecasts. Has SYNLAB AG Been A Good Investment? With a total shareholder return of -44% over three years, SYNLAB AG shareholders would by and large be disappointed. So shareholders would probably want the company to be less generous with CEO compensation. To Conclude... Despite the growth in its earnings, the share price decline in the past three years is certainly concerning. A huge lag in share price growth when earnings have grown may indicate there could be other issues that are affecting the company at the moment that the market is focused on. If there are some unknown variables that are influencing the stock's price, surely shareholders would have some concerns. The upcoming AGM will be a chance for shareholders to question the board on key matters, such as CEO remuneration or any other issues they might have and revisit their investment thesis with regards to the company. CEO compensation can have a massive impact on performance, but it's just one element. That's why we did some digging and identified 1 warning sign for SYNLAB that investors should think about before committing capital to this stock. Important note: SYNLAB is an exciting stock, but we understand investors may be looking for an unencumbered balance sheet and blockbuster returns. You might find something better in this list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt. Valuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple.

Although the dividend is now higher, the yield is only 2.0%, which is below the industry average. View our latest analysis for Deutsche Börse Deutsche Börse's Dividend Is Well Covered By Earnings Even a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. The last dividend was quite easily covered by Deutsche Börse's earnings. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business. Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 18.4%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 36%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend. XTRA:DB1 Historic Dividend May 10th 2024 Deutsche Börse Has A Solid Track Record The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from €2.10 total annually to €3.80. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 6.1% over that duration. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios. The Dividend Looks Likely To Grow Some investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Deutsche Börse has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 15% per annum. The company is paying a reasonable amount of earnings to shareholders, and is growing earnings at a decent rate so we think it could be a decent dividend stock. We Really Like Deutsche Börse's Dividend Overall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Deutsche Börse is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity. Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Companies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term. See what the 12 analysts we track are forecasting for Deutsche Börse for free with public analyst estimates for the company .

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Although, when we looked at E.ON ( ETR:EOAN ), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes. Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for E.ON, this is the formula: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.014 = €1.0b ÷ (€114b - €38b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023) . So, E.ON has an ROCE of 1.4%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Integrated Utilities industry average of 5.9%. View our latest analysis for E.ON XTRA:EOAN Return on Capital Employed May 10th 2024 Above you can see how the current ROCE for E.ON compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for E.ON . What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us On the surface, the trend of ROCE at E.ON doesn't inspire confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 7.3%, but since then they've fallen to 1.4%. And considering revenue has dropped while employing more capital, we'd be cautious. This could mean that the business is losing its competitive advantage or market share, because while more money is being put into ventures, it's actually producing a lower return - \"less bang for their buck\" per se. In Conclusion... We're a bit apprehensive about E.ON because despite more capital being deployed in the business, returns on that capital and sales have both fallen. However the stock has delivered a 70% return to shareholders over the last five years, so investors might be expecting the trends to turn around. Regardless, we don't feel too comfortable with the fundamentals so we'd be steering clear of this stock for now.

This report focused on revenue estimates, and it looks as though the consensus view of the business has become substantially more conservative. Following the downgrade, the consensus from 15 analysts covering RWE is for revenues of €27b in 2024, implying a concerning 22% decline in sales compared to the last 12 months. Before the latest update, the analysts were foreseeing €30b of revenue in 2024. It looks like forecasts have become a fair bit less optimistic on RWE, given the substantial drop in revenue estimates. View our latest analysis for RWE XTRA:RWE Earnings and Revenue Growth May 10th 2024 Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. These estimates imply that sales are expected to slow, with a forecast annualised revenue decline of 22% by the end of 2024. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 28% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 7.4% annually for the foreseeable future. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - RWE is expected to lag the wider industry. The Bottom Line The clear low-light was that analysts slashing their revenue forecasts for RWE this year. They also expect company revenue to perform worse than the wider market. Overall, given the drastic downgrade to this year's forecasts, we'd be feeling a little more wary of RWE going forwards. There might be good reason for analyst bearishness towards RWE, like concerns around earnings quality.

At the upcoming AGM on 17th of May, shareholders can hear from the board including their plans for turning around performance. It would also be an opportunity for shareholders to influence management through voting on company resolutions such as executive remuneration, which could impact the firm significantly. From our analysis, we think CEO compensation may need a review in light of the recent performance. See our latest analysis for Berentzen-Gruppe Comparing Berentzen-Gruppe Aktiengesellschaft's CEO Compensation With The Industry According to our data, Berentzen-Gruppe Aktiengesellschaft has a market capitalization of €53m, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth €629k over the year to December 2023. That's a notable decrease of 13% on last year. We note that the salary portion, which stands at €400.0k constitutes the majority of total compensation received by the CEO. In comparison with other companies in the Germany Beverage industry with market capitalizations under €185m, the reported median total CEO compensation was €311k. This suggests that Oliver Schwegmann is paid more than the median for the industry. Component 2023 2022 Proportion (2023) Salary €400k €400k 64% Other €229k €324k 36% Total Compensation €629k €724k 100% On an industry level, roughly 56% of total compensation represents salary and 44% is other remuneration. According to our research, Berentzen-Gruppe has allocated a higher percentage of pay to salary in comparison to the wider industry. If salary is the major component in total compensation, it suggests that the CEO receives a higher fixed proportion of the total compensation, regardless of performance. XTRA:BEZ CEO Compensation May 10th 2024 A Look at Berentzen-Gruppe Aktiengesellschaft's Growth Numbers Over the last three years, Berentzen-Gruppe Aktiengesellschaft has shrunk its earnings per share by 11% per year. It achieved revenue growth of 6.6% over the last year. The decline in EPS is a bit concerning. And the modest revenue growth over 12 months isn't much comfort against the reduced EPS. These factors suggest that the business performance wouldn't really justify a high pay packet for the CEO. Historical performance can sometimes be a good indicator on what's coming up next but if you want to peer into the company's future you might be interested in this free visualization of analyst forecasts. Has Berentzen-Gruppe Aktiengesellschaft Been A Good Investment? Given the total shareholder loss of 4.0% over three years, many shareholders in Berentzen-Gruppe Aktiengesellschaft are probably rather dissatisfied, to say the least. So shareholders would probably want the company to be less generous with CEO compensation. To Conclude... Along with the business performing poorly, shareholders have suffered with poor share price returns on their investments, suggesting that there's little to no chance of them being in favor of a CEO pay raise. At the upcoming AGM, the board will get the chance to explain the steps it plans to take to improve business performance.

Elmos Semiconductor reported in line with analyst predictions, delivering revenues of €137m and statutory earnings per share of €5.79, suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year. View our latest analysis for Elmos Semiconductor XTRA:ELG Earnings and Revenue Growth May 10th 2024 Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Elmos Semiconductor's five analysts is for revenues of €596.7m in 2024. This reflects a reasonable 2.7% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are forecast to dip 4.4% to €5.76 in the same period. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of €596.4m and earnings per share (EPS) of €5.69 in 2024. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results. It will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at €92.40. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. There are some variant perceptions on Elmos Semiconductor, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at €110 and the most bearish at €75.00 per share. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure. One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would highlight that Elmos Semiconductor's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 3.6% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 20% p.a. growth over the last five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 8.3% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Elmos Semiconductor. The Bottom Line The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates. With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Elmos Semiconductor. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Elmos Semiconductor going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here. .

{"source_name": "Simply Wall St", "title": "Analysts Are Updating Their TeamViewer SE (ETR:TMV) Estimates After Its First-Quarter Results", "title_link": "https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/software/etr-tmv/teamviewer-shares/news/analysts-are-updating-their-teamviewer-se-etrtmv-estimates-a", "published_date": "May 10, 2024", "Description": "Shareholders might have noticed that TeamViewer SE ( ETR:TMV ) filed its quarterly result this time last week. The early response was not positive, with shares down 6.4% to €11.64 in the past week. TeamViewer reported in line with analyst predictions, delivering revenues of €162m and statutory earnings per share of €0.66, suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year. View our latest analysis for TeamViewer XTRA:TMV Earnings and Revenue Growth May 10th 2024 Following the latest results, TeamViewer's 14 analysts are now forecasting revenues of €672.1m in 2024. This would be a reasonable 5.5% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to increase 3.4% to €0.72. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of €670.8m and earnings per share (EPS) of €0.70 in 2024. So the consensus seems to have become somewhat more optimistic on TeamViewer's earnings potential following these results. The consensus price target was unchanged at €16.72, implying that the improved earnings outlook is not expected to have a long term impact on value creation for shareholders. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. There are some variant perceptions on TeamViewer, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at €21.00 and the most bearish at €13.00 per share. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable. Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that TeamViewer's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 7.4% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 13% over the past five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 9.8% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than TeamViewer. The Bottom Line The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards TeamViewer following these results. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that TeamViewer's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates. With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on TeamViewer. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have estimates - from multiple TeamViewer analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here. You still need to take note of risks, for example - TeamViewer has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of. Valuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple.

The early response was not positive, with shares down 3.3% to €8.32 in the past week. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year. View our latest analysis for Westwing Group XTRA:WEW Earnings and Revenue Growth May 10th 2024 Following last week's earnings report, Westwing Group's three analysts are forecasting 2024 revenues to be €441.3m, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Before this latest report, the consensus had been expecting revenues of €440.6m and €0.25 per share in losses. So we can see that while the consensus made no real change to its revenue estimates, it also no longer provides an earnings per share estimate. This suggests that revenues are what the market is focusing on after the latest results. There's been no real change to the consensus price target of €11.00, with Westwing Group seemingly executing in line with expectations. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. The most optimistic Westwing Group analyst has a price target of €12.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at €10.00. Even so, with a relatively close grouping of estimates, it looks like the analysts are quite confident in their valuations, suggesting Westwing Group is an easy business to forecast or the the analysts are all using similar assumptions. Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry . It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Westwing Group's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 2.2% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 9.8% over the past five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 5.6% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Westwing Group. The Bottom Line The clear take away from these updates is that the analysts made no change to their revenue estimates for next year, with the business apparently performing in line with their models. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that Westwing Group's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.

{"source_name": "Simply Wall St", "title": "Hensoldt AG (ETR:5UH) Released Earnings Last Week And Analysts Lifted Their Price Target To €38.36", "title_link": "https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/capital-goods/etr-5uh/hensoldt-shares/news/hensoldt-ag-etr5uh-released-earnings-last-week-and-analysts", "published_date": "May 10, 2024", "Description": "The analysts might have been a bit too bullish on Hensoldt AG ( ETR:5UH ), given that the company fell short of expectations when it released its quarterly results last week. Revenues missed expectations somewhat, coming in at €329m, but statutory earnings fell catastrophically short, with a loss of €0.13 some 61% larger than what the analysts had predicted. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year. See our latest analysis for Hensoldt XTRA:5UH Earnings and Revenue Growth May 10th 2024 Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Hensoldt's eight analysts is for revenues of €2.30b in 2024. This would reflect a substantial 25% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to bounce 115% to €1.10. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of €2.29b and earnings per share (EPS) of €1.18 in 2024. The analysts seem to have become a little more negative on the business after the latest results, given the small dip in their earnings per share numbers for next year. Althoughthe analysts have revised their earnings forecasts for next year, they've also lifted the consensus price target 5.1% to €38.36, suggesting the revised estimates are not indicative of a weaker long-term future for the business. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Hensoldt at €49.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at €27.00. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation. Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry . The analysts are definitely expecting Hensoldt's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 35% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 13% per annum over the past three years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 16% per year. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Hensoldt is expected to grow much faster than its industry. The Bottom Line The biggest concern is that the analysts reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds could lay ahead for Hensoldt. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving. With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Hensoldt going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here. . Don't forget that there may still be risks.

Notably, that's an increase of 42% over the year before. We note that the salary of €450.0k makes up a sizeable portion of the total compensation received by the CEO. For comparison, other companies in the German Commercial Services industry with market capitalizations ranging between €371m and €1.5b had a median total CEO compensation of €846k. So it looks like TAKKT compensates Maria Zesch in line with the median for the industry. Component 2023 2022 Proportion (2023) Salary €450k €450k 52% Other €415k €159k 48% Total Compensation €865k €609k 100% On an industry level, around 56% of total compensation represents salary and 44% is other remuneration. There isn't a significant difference between TAKKT and the broader market, in terms of salary allocation in the overall compensation package. If total compensation veers towards salary, it suggests that the variable portion - which is generally tied to performance, is lower. XTRA:TTK CEO Compensation May 10th 2024 TAKKT AG's Growth Over the last three years, TAKKT AG has shrunk its earnings per share by 27% per year. In the last year, its revenue is down 11%. Overall this is not a very positive result for shareholders. This is compounded by the fact revenue is actually down on last year. These factors suggest that the business performance wouldn't really justify a high pay packet for the CEO. Moving away from current form for a second, it could be important to check this free visual depiction of what analysts expect for the future . Has TAKKT AG Been A Good Investment? TAKKT AG has served shareholders reasonably well, with a total return of 22% over three years. But they would probably prefer not to see CEO compensation far in excess of the median. To Conclude... Shareholder returns, while positive, should be looked at along with earnings, which have not grown at all recently. This makes us think the share price momentum may slow in the future. In the upcoming AGM, shareholders will get the opportunity to discuss any concerns with the board, including those related to CEO remuneration and assess if the board's plan will likely improve performance in the future. CEO compensation can have a massive impact on performance, but it's just one element. We've identified 3 warning signs for TAKKT that investors should be aware of in a dynamic business environment. Important note: TAKKT is an exciting stock, but we understand investors may be looking for an unencumbered balance sheet and blockbuster returns. You might find something better in this list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt. Valuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple.

Bayerische Motoren Werke reported €37b in revenue, roughly in line with analyst forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of €4.42 beat expectations, being 6.0% higher than what the analysts expected. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year. See our latest analysis for Bayerische Motoren Werke XTRA:BMW Earnings and Revenue Growth May 10th 2024 Following last week's earnings report, Bayerische Motoren Werke's 17 analysts are forecasting 2024 revenues to be €157.2b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of €157.6b and earnings per share (EPS) of €16.42 in 2024. So we can see that while the consensus made no real change to its revenue estimates, it also no longer provides an earnings per share estimate. This suggests that revenues are what the market is focusing on after the latest results. There's been no real change to the consensus price target of €113, with Bayerische Motoren Werke seemingly executing in line with expectations. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. The most optimistic Bayerische Motoren Werke analyst has a price target of €165 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at €90.00. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business. Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry . It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Bayerische Motoren Werke's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 1.6% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 11% over the past five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 3.8% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Bayerische Motoren Werke. The Bottom Line The clear take away from these updates is that the analysts made no change to their revenue estimates for next year, with the business apparently performing in line with their models. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates. At least one of Bayerische Motoren Werke's 17 analysts has provided estimates out to 2026, which can be seen for free on our platform here. However, before you get too enthused, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Bayerische Motoren Werke (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of. Valuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's limited. With its earnings growth in positive territory compared to the declining earnings of most other companies, Energiekontor has been doing quite well of late. One possibility is that the P/E is low because investors think the company's earnings are going to fall away like everyone else's soon. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour. See our latest analysis for Energiekontor XTRA:EKT Price to Earnings Ratio vs Industry May 10th 2024 If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Energiekontor . Is There Any Growth For Energiekontor? The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as low as Energiekontor's is when the company's growth is on track to lag the market. Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 88% gain to the company's bottom line. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 320% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company. Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to slump, contracting by 3.4% per year during the coming three years according to the four analysts following the company. That's not great when the rest of the market is expected to grow by 13% each year. With this information, we are not surprised that Energiekontor is trading at a P/E lower than the market. However, shrinking earnings are unlikely to lead to a stable P/E over the longer term. There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability. The Bottom Line On Energiekontor's P/E Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company. As we suspected, our examination of Energiekontor's analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking earnings is contributing to its low P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio. Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels. Before you take the next step, you should know about the 3 warning signs for Energiekontor (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that we have uncovered.

( ETR:RRTL ), might not be a large cap stock, but it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the XTRA, rising to highs of €35.78 and falling to the lows of €28.95. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether RTL Group's current trading price of €29.65 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at RTL Group’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for RTL Group What Is RTL Group Worth? The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 10.60% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy RTL Group today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is €26.81, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. In addition to this, RTL Group has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market. What does the future of RTL Group look like? XTRA:RRTL Earnings and Revenue Growth May 10th 2024 Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. RTL Group's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 38%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value. What This Means For You Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in RRTL’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value? Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on RRTL, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop. So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

This means the annual payment is 2.8% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. View our latest analysis for Allgeier Allgeier's Earnings Easily Cover The Distributions While it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. The last dividend was quite easily covered by Allgeier's earnings. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business. The next year is set to see EPS grow by 117.8%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 20% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward. XTRA:AEIN Historic Dividend May 10th 2024 Allgeier Is Still Building Its Track Record Even though the company has been paying a consistent dividend for a while, we would like to see a few more years before we feel comfortable relying on it. The payments haven't really changed that much since 6 years ago. Modest dividend growth is good to see, especially with the payments being relatively stable. However, the payment history is relatively short and we wouldn't want to rely on this dividend too much. The Dividend Looks Likely To Grow Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Allgeier has impressed us by growing EPS at 23% per year over the past five years. The company doesn't have any problems growing, despite returning a lot of capital to shareholders, which is a very nice combination for a dividend stock to have. We Really Like Allgeier's Dividend Overall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock. Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For instance, we've picked out 2 warning signs for Allgeier that investors should take into consideration.

{"source_name": "Simply Wall St", "title": "Heidelberg Materials (ETR:HEI) Is Increasing Its Dividend To €3.00", "title_link": "https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/materials/etr-hei/heidelberg-materials-shares/news/heidelberg-materials-etrhei-is-increasing-its-dividend-to-30", "published_date": "May 09, 2024", "Description": "Heidelberg Materials AG ( ETR:HEI ) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 22nd of May to €3.00. This will take the annual payment to 3.1% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. See our latest analysis for Heidelberg Materials Heidelberg Materials' Dividend Is Well Covered By Earnings Impressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. However, Heidelberg Materials' earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business. Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 21.5% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 25% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward. XTRA:HEI Historic Dividend May 9th 2024 Dividend Volatility The company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. The annual payment during the last 10 years was €0.60 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was €3.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 17% a year over that time. Despite the rapid growth in the dividend over the past number of years, we have seen the payments go down the past as well, so that makes us cautious. The Dividend Looks Likely To Grow With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. Heidelberg Materials has impressed us by growing EPS at 14% per year over the past five years. Heidelberg Materials definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio. Heidelberg Materials Looks Like A Great Dividend Stock Overall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Heidelberg Materials is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity. Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

We can see that individual investors own the lion's share in the company with 44% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). And last week, individual investors endured the biggest losses as the stock fell by 10%. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of HomeToGo, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for HomeToGo XTRA:HTG Ownership Breakdown May 9th 2024 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About HomeToGo? Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. We can see that HomeToGo does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at HomeToGo's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. XTRA:HTG Earnings and Revenue Growth May 9th 2024 Hedge funds don't have many shares in HomeToGo. Insight Venture Management, LLC is currently the company's largest shareholder with 19% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 11% and 9.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. To make our study more interesting, we found that the top 5 shareholders control more than half of the company which implies that this group has considerable sway over the company's decision-making. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. Insider Ownership Of HomeToGo The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. It seems insiders own a significant proportion of HomeToGo SE. Insiders have a €24m stake in this €207m business. It is great to see insiders so invested in the business. It might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public Ownership The general public-- including retail investors -- own 44% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. Private Equity Ownership Private equity firms hold a 37% stake in HomeToGo. This suggests they can be influential in key policy decisions. Sometimes we see private equity stick around for the long term, but generally speaking they have a shorter investment horizon and -- as the name suggests -- don't invest in public companies much. After some time they may look to sell and redeploy capital elsewhere. Next Steps: While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with HomeToGo , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

Revenues came in at €1.9b, in line with expectations, while statutory losses per share were substantially higher than expected, at €0.65 per share. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year. Check out our latest analysis for About You Holding DB:YOU Earnings and Revenue Growth May 9th 2024 Following the latest results, About You Holding's nine analysts are now forecasting revenues of €2.02b in 2025. This would be a reasonable 4.3% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. The loss per share is expected to greatly reduce in the near future, narrowing 48% to €0.34. Before this earnings announcement, the analysts had been modelling revenues of €2.08b and losses of €0.33 per share in 2025. There was no real change to the average price target of €5.68, suggesting that the revisions to revenue estimates are not expected to have a long-term impact on About You Holding's valuation. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. The most optimistic About You Holding analyst has a price target of €7.50 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at €3.60. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business. Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry . It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that About You Holding's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2025 expected to display 4.3% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 13% over the past three years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 5.5% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than About You Holding. The Bottom Line The most important thing to take away is that the analysts reconfirmed their loss per share estimates for next year. On the negative side, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates. Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider. We have forecasts for About You Holding going out to 2027, and you can see them free on our platform here.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex. Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model . See our latest analysis for Carl Zeiss Meditec Step By Step Through The Calculation We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF (€, Millions) €312.3m €271.3m €322.9m €360.7m €387.3m €405.8m €420.2m €431.5m €440.5m €447.9m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x6 Analyst x8 Analyst x7 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 4.78% Est @ 3.55% Est @ 2.69% Est @ 2.09% Est @ 1.66% Present Value (€, Millions) Discounted @ 4.9% €298 €246 €279 €297 €304 €304 €300 €294 €286 €277 (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = €2.9b After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (0.7%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 4.9%. Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = €448m× (1 + 0.7%) ÷ (4.9%– 0.7%) = €11b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = €11b÷ ( 1 + 4.9%) 10 = €6.5b The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is €9.4b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of €93.9, the company appears about fair value at a 11% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. XTRA:AFX Discounted Cash Flow May 9th 2024 The Assumptions We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Carl Zeiss Meditec as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 4.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.925. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for Carl Zeiss Meditec Strength Debt is not viewed as a risk. Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows. Dividend information for AFX. Weakness Earnings declined over the past year. Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Medical Equipment market. Opportunity Annual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the German market. Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Threat Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the German market. What else are analysts forecasting for AFX? Moving On: Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So on that note, Borussia Dortmund GmbH Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien ( ETR:BVB ) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital. What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)? For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Borussia Dortmund GmbH Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien, this is the formula: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.094 = €40m ÷ (€614m - €192m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023) . So, Borussia Dortmund GmbH Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien has an ROCE of 9.4%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Entertainment industry average of 17%. View our latest analysis for Borussia Dortmund GmbH Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien XTRA:BVB Return on Capital Employed May 9th 2024 In the above chart we have measured Borussia Dortmund GmbH Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.

{"source_name": "Simply Wall St", "title": "HOCHTIEF (ETR:HOT) Will Be Hoping To Turn Its Returns On Capital Around", "title_link": "https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/capital-goods/etr-hot/hochtief-shares/news/hochtief-etrhot-will-be-hoping-to-turn-its-returns-on-capita", "published_date": "May 09, 2024", "Description": "When we're researching a company, it's sometimes hard to find the warning signs, but there are some financial metrics that can help spot trouble early. A business that's potentially in decline often shows two trends, a return on capital employed (ROCE) that's declining, and a base of capital employed that's also declining. Ultimately this means that the company is earning less per dollar invested and on top of that, it's shrinking its base of capital employed. In light of that, from a first glance at HOCHTIEF ( ETR:HOT ), we've spotted some signs that it could be struggling, so let's investigate. What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)? If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for HOCHTIEF, this is the formula: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.085 = €598m ÷ (€19b - €12b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023) . Thus, HOCHTIEF has an ROCE of 8.5%. In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Construction industry average of 10%. Check out our latest analysis for HOCHTIEF XTRA:HOT Return on Capital Employed May 9th 2024 In the above chart we have measured HOCHTIEF's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering HOCHTIEF for free. So How Is HOCHTIEF's ROCE Trending? There is reason to be cautious about HOCHTIEF, given the returns are trending downwards. To be more specific, the ROCE was 15% five years ago, but since then it has dropped noticeably. On top of that, it's worth noting that the amount of capital employed within the business has remained relatively steady. This combination can be indicative of a mature business that still has areas to deploy capital, but the returns received aren't as high due potentially to new competition or smaller margins. So because these trends aren't typically conducive to creating a multi-bagger, we wouldn't hold our breath on HOCHTIEF becoming one if things continue as they have. Another thing to note, HOCHTIEF has a high ratio of current liabilities to total assets of 63%. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks. In Conclusion... In summary, it's unfortunate that HOCHTIEF is generating lower returns from the same amount of capital. Investors must expect better things on the horizon though because the stock has risen 16% in the last five years. Either way, we aren't huge fans of the current trends and so with that we think you might find better investments elsewhere.

At the next AGM coming up on 15th of May, they can influence managerial decision making through voting on resolutions, including executive remuneration. Setting appropriate executive remuneration to align with the interests of shareholders may also be a way to influence the company performance in the long run. We think CEO compensation looks appropriate given the data we have put together. See our latest analysis for SAP Comparing SAP SE's CEO Compensation With The Industry At the time of writing, our data shows that SAP SE has a market capitalization of €205b, and reported total annual CEO compensation of €8.5m for the year to December 2023. This means that the compensation hasn't changed much from last year. We think total compensation is more important but our data shows that the CEO salary is lower, at €1.1m. In comparison with other companies in the German Software industry with market capitalizations over €7.4b, the reported median total CEO compensation was €13m. This suggests that Christian Klein is paid below the industry median. Component 2023 2022 Proportion (2023) Salary €1.1m €1.1m 13% Other €7.4m €7.4m 87% Total Compensation €8.5m €8.5m 100% On an industry level, roughly 65% of total compensation represents salary and 35% is other remuneration. It's interesting to note that SAP allocates a smaller portion of compensation to salary in comparison to the broader industry. It's important to note that a slant towards non-salary compensation suggests that total pay is tied to the company's performance. XTRA:SAP CEO Compensation May 9th 2024 SAP SE's Growth Over the last three years, SAP SE has shrunk its earnings per share by 21% per year. In the last year, its revenue is up 5.4%. Few shareholders would be pleased to read that EPS have declined. The modest increase in revenue in the last year isn't enough to make us overlook the disappointing change in EPS. So given this relatively weak performance, shareholders would probably not want to see high compensation for the CEO. Moving away from current form for a second, it could be important to check this free visual depiction of what analysts expect for the future . Has SAP SE Been A Good Investment? We think that the total shareholder return of 67%, over three years, would leave most SAP SE shareholders smiling. As a result, some may believe the CEO should be paid more than is normal for companies of similar size. To Conclude... Although shareholders would be quite happy with the returns they have earned on their initial investment, earnings have failed to grow and this could mean these strong returns may not continue. These are are some concerns that shareholders may want to address the board when they revisit their investment thesis. CEO compensation is a crucial aspect to keep your eyes on but investors also need to keep their eyes open for other issues related to business performance. We did our research and spotted 1 warning sign for SAP that investors should look into moving forward.

This takes the annual payment to 0.9% of the current stock price, which unfortunately is below what the industry is paying. See our latest analysis for Frequentis Frequentis' Payment Has Solid Earnings Coverage If it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. However, Frequentis' earnings easily cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business. The next year is set to see EPS grow by 34.8%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 11%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend. XTRA:FQT Historic Dividend May 9th 2024 Frequentis Is Still Building Its Track Record Looking back, the dividend has been stable, but the company hasn't been paying a dividend for very long so we can't be confident that the dividend will remain stable through all economic environments. Since 2020, the annual payment back then was €0.15, compared to the most recent full-year payment of €0.24. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 12% a year over that time. The dividend has been growing rapidly, however with such a short payment history we can't know for sure if payment can continue to grow over the long term, so caution may be warranted. Frequentis Could Grow Its Dividend Some investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that Frequentis has been growing its earnings per share at 8.1% a year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time. Frequentis Looks Like A Great Dividend Stock Overall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock. Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. See if management have their own wealth at stake, by checking insider shareholdings in Frequentis stock.

We believe that shareholders have noticed some concerning factors beyond the statutory profit numbers. View our latest analysis for Plan Optik XTRA:P4O Earnings and Revenue History May 9th 2024 To understand the value of a company's earnings growth, it is imperative to consider any dilution of shareholders' interests. In fact, Plan Optik increased the number of shares on issue by 6.0% over the last twelve months by issuing new shares. That means its earnings are split among a greater number of shares. To talk about net income, without noticing earnings per share, is to be distracted by the big numbers while ignoring the smaller numbers that talk to per share value. You can see a chart of Plan Optik's EPS by clicking here . How Is Dilution Impacting Plan Optik's Earnings Per Share (EPS)? Three years ago, Plan Optik lost money. On the bright side, in the last twelve months it grew profit by 22%. On the other hand, earnings per share are only up 8.7% over the same period. Therefore, the dilution is having a noteworthy influence on shareholder returns. In the long term, earnings per share growth should beget share price growth. So Plan Optik shareholders will want to see that EPS figure continue to increase. But on the other hand, we'd be far less excited to learn profit (but not EPS) was improving. For the ordinary retail shareholder, EPS is a great measure to check your hypothetical \"share\" of the company's profit. Note: we always recommend investors check balance sheet strength. Click here to be taken to our balance sheet analysis of Plan Optik . Our Take On Plan Optik's Profit Performance Each Plan Optik share now gets a meaningfully smaller slice of its overall profit, due to dilution of existing shareholders. Because of this, we think that it may be that Plan Optik's statutory profits are better than its underlying earnings power. But the good news is that its EPS growth over the last three years has been very impressive. Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors. If you'd like to know more about Plan Optik as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Plan Optik you should be aware of.

Despite positive EPS growth in the past few years, the share price hasn't tracked the fundamental performance of the company. Shareholders may want to question the board on the future direction of the company at the upcoming AGM on 15th of May. They could also influence management through voting on resolutions such as executive remuneration. We think shareholders might be reluctant to increase compensation for the CEO at the moment, according to our analysis below. Check out our latest analysis for Amadeus FiRe How Does Total Compensation For Robert Von Wulfing Compare With Other Companies In The Industry? Our data indicates that Amadeus FiRe AG has a market capitalization of €609m, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as €1.2m for the year to December 2023. That's a modest increase of 7.1% on the prior year. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth acknowledging that the salary portion is lower, valued at €420k. On comparing similar companies from the Germany Professional Services industry with market caps ranging from €372m to €1.5b, we found that the median CEO total compensation was €855k. This suggests that Robert Von Wulfing is paid more than the median for the industry. What's more, Robert Von Wulfing holds €269k worth of shares in the company in their own name. Component 2023 2022 Proportion (2023) Salary €420k €420k 35% Other €778k €699k 65% Total Compensation €1.2m €1.1m 100% On an industry level, around 65% of total compensation represents salary and 35% is other remuneration. It's interesting to note that Amadeus FiRe allocates a smaller portion of compensation to salary in comparison to the broader industry. If non-salary compensation dominates total pay, it's an indicator that the executive's salary is tied to company performance. XTRA:AAD CEO Compensation May 9th 2024 Amadeus FiRe AG's Growth Over the past three years, Amadeus FiRe AG has seen its earnings per share (EPS) grow by 24% per year. It achieved revenue growth of 7.4% over the last year. This demonstrates that the company has been improving recently and is good news for the shareholders. It's nice to see revenue heading northwards, as this is consistent with healthy business conditions. Looking ahead, you might want to check this free visual report on analyst forecasts for the company's future earnings. . Has Amadeus FiRe AG Been A Good Investment? Since shareholders would have lost about 18% over three years, some Amadeus FiRe AG investors would surely be feeling negative emotions. So shareholders would probably want the company to be less generous with CEO compensation. In Summary... Shareholders have not seen their shares grow in value, rather they have seen their shares decline. The fact that the stock price hasn't grown along with earnings may indicate that other issues may be affecting that stock. Shareholders would be keen to know what's holding the stock back when earnings have grown. At the upcoming AGM, shareholders will get the opportunity to discuss any issues with the board, including those related to CEO remuneration and assess if the board's plan will likely improve performance in the future. While it is important to pay attention to CEO remuneration, investors should also consider other elements of the business. We've identified 1 warning sign for Amadeus FiRe that investors should be aware of in a dynamic business environment.

These concerns will be at the front of shareholders' minds as they go into the AGM coming up on 15th of May. It would also be an opportunity for them to influence management through exercising their voting power on company resolutions, including CEO and executive remuneration, which could impact on firm performance in the future. From the data that we gathered, we think that shareholders should hold off on a raise on CEO compensation until performance starts to show some improvement. View our latest analysis for Bayerische Motoren Werke Comparing Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft's CEO Compensation With The Industry At the time of writing, our data shows that Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft has a market capitalization of €64b, and reported total annual CEO compensation of €8.9m for the year to December 2023. That's a notable decrease of 18% on last year. While we always look at total compensation first, our analysis shows that the salary component is less, at €2.0m. On comparing similar companies in the German Auto industry with market capitalizations above €7.4b, we found that the median total CEO compensation was €6.8m. From this we gather that Oliver Zipse is paid around the median for CEOs in the industry.

The modest increase in revenue in the last year isn't enough to make us overlook the disappointing change in EPS.

Has Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft Been A Good Investment? Boasting a total shareholder return of 43% over three years, Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft has done well by shareholders.

With 42% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to €194m last week after a 12% drop in the share price. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 37% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Often called “market movers\", institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Koenig & Bauer which might hurt individual investors. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Koenig & Bauer, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Koenig & Bauer XTRA:SKB Ownership Breakdown May 9th 2024 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Koenig & Bauer? Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. We can see that Koenig & Bauer does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Koenig & Bauer's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. XTRA:SKB Earnings and Revenue Growth May 9th 2024 We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Koenig & Bauer. Our data shows that Alterninvest is the largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 10% and 9.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. We also observed that the top 7 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. Insider Ownership Of Koenig & Bauer The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Koenig & Bauer AG. Insiders have a €29m stake in this €194m business. It is great to see insiders so invested in the business. It might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public Ownership The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 21% stake in Koenig & Bauer. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. Private Company Ownership We can see that Private Companies own 22%, of the shares on issue. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company. Next Steps: I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with Koenig & Bauer , and understanding them should be part of your investment process. But ultimately it is the future , not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future .

As shareholders go into the upcoming AGM on 15th of May, CEO compensation will probably not be their focus, but rather the steps management will take to continue the growth momentum. However, some shareholders may still want to keep CEO compensation within reason. See our latest analysis for AIXTRON How Does Total Compensation For Felix Grawert Compare With Other Companies In The Industry? According to our data, AIXTRON SE has a market capitalization of €2.5b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth €4.3m over the year to December 2023. This means that the compensation hasn't changed much from last year. While we always look at total compensation first, our analysis shows that the salary component is less, at €430k. In comparison with other companies in the German Semiconductor industry with market capitalizations ranging from €1.9b to €6.0b, the reported median CEO total compensation was €545k. Hence, we can conclude that Felix Grawert is remunerated higher than the industry median. Component 2023 2022 Proportion (2023) Salary €430k €430k 10% Other €3.8m €3.9m 90% Total Compensation €4.3m €4.4m 100% Speaking on an industry level, nearly 31% of total compensation represents salary, while the remainder of 69% is other remuneration. It's interesting to note that AIXTRON allocates a smaller portion of compensation to salary in comparison to the broader industry. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance. XTRA:AIXA CEO Compensation May 9th 2024 A Look at AIXTRON SE's Growth Numbers AIXTRON SE has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 56% a year over the past three years. In the last year, its revenue is up 49%. Shareholders would be glad to know that the company has improved itself over the last few years. Most shareholders would be pleased to see strong revenue growth combined with EPS growth. This combo suggests a fast growing business. Moving away from current form for a second, it could be important to check this free visual depiction of what analysts expect for the future . Has AIXTRON SE Been A Good Investment? Boasting a total shareholder return of 53% over three years, AIXTRON SE has done well by shareholders. So they may not be at all concerned if the CEO were to be paid more than is normal for companies around the same size. In Summary... Seeing that the company has put up a decent performance, only a few shareholders, if any at all, might have questions about the CEO pay in the upcoming AGM. However, any decision to raise CEO pay might be met with some objections from the shareholders given that the CEO is already paid higher than the industry average. We can learn a lot about a company by studying its CEO compensation trends, along with looking at other aspects of the business. We did our research and identified 3 warning signs (and 1 which doesn't sit too well with us) in AIXTRON we think you should know about.

{"source_name": "Simply Wall St", "title": "Investors Still Aren't Entirely Convinced By Turbon AG's (FRA:TUR) Revenues Despite 27% Price Jump", "title_link": "https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/commercial-services/fra-tur/turbon-shares/news/investors-still-arent-entirely-convinced-by-turbon-ags-fratu", "published_date": "May 09, 2024", "Description": "Turbon AG ( FRA:TUR ) shareholders would be excited to see that the share price has had a great month, posting a 27% gain and recovering from prior weakness. But the gains over the last month weren't enough to make shareholders whole, as the share price is still down 7.5% in the last twelve months. Although its price has surged higher, it's still not a stretch to say that Turbon's price-to-sales (or \"P/S\") ratio of 0.2x right now seems quite \"middle-of-the-road\" compared to the Commercial Services industry in Germany, where the median P/S ratio is around 0.6x. While this might not raise any eyebrows, if the P/S ratio is not justified investors could be missing out on a potential opportunity or ignoring looming disappointment. View our latest analysis for Turbon DB:TUR Price to Sales Ratio vs Industry May 9th 2024 How Has Turbon Performed Recently? The recent revenue growth at Turbon would have to be considered satisfactory if not spectacular. One possibility is that the P/S is moderate because investors think this good revenue growth might only be parallel to the broader industry in the near future. Those who are bullish on Turbon will be hoping that this isn't the case, so that they can pick up the stock at a lower valuation. Want the full picture on earnings, revenue and cash flow for the company? Then our free report on Turbon will help you shine a light on its historical performance. What Are Revenue Growth Metrics Telling Us About The P/S? Turbon's P/S ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the industry. If we review the last year of revenue growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 3.9%. This was backed up an excellent period prior to see revenue up by 37% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have definitely welcomed those medium-term rates of revenue growth. Comparing that recent medium-term revenue trajectory with the industry's one-year growth forecast of 6.9% shows it's noticeably more attractive. With this information, we find it interesting that Turbon is trading at a fairly similar P/S compared to the industry. Apparently some shareholders believe the recent performance is at its limits and have been accepting lower selling prices. What Does Turbon's P/S Mean For Investors? Its shares have lifted substantially and now Turbon's P/S is back within range of the industry median. While the price-to-sales ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of revenue expectations. We didn't quite envision Turbon's P/S sitting in line with the wider industry, considering the revenue growth over the last three-year is higher than the current industry outlook. When we see strong revenue with faster-than-industry growth, we can only assume potential risks are what might be placing pressure on the P/S ratio. At least the risk of a price drop looks to be subdued if recent medium-term revenue trends continue, but investors seem to think future revenue could see some volatility. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 3 warning signs for Turbon that you need to be mindful of. It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across. So if growing profitability aligns with your idea of a great company, take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with strong recent earnings growth (and a low P/E). Valuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple.

KGaA (ETR:SAX)?", "title_link": "https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/media/etr-sax/stroer-se-kgaa-shares/news/is-now-the-time-to-look-at-buying-strer-se-co-kgaa-etrsax", "published_date": "May 09, 2024", "Description": "While Ströer SE & Co. KGaA ( ETR:SAX ) might not have the largest market cap around , it led the XTRA gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The company's trading levels have reached its high for the past year, following the recent bounce in the share price. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Ströer SE KGaA’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Ströer SE KGaA What's The Opportunity In Ströer SE KGaA? According to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. In this instance, we’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. We find that Ströer SE KGaA’s ratio of 37.68x is above its peer average of 21.68x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Media industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Ströer SE KGaA’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility. Can we expect growth from Ströer SE KGaA? XTRA:SAX Earnings and Revenue Growth May 9th 2024 Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Ströer SE KGaA's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value. What This Means For You Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in SAX’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe SAX should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed. Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SAX for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for SAX, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop. With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. For example - Ströer SE KGaA has 3 warning signs we think you should be aware of.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's limited. Münchener Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft in München has been struggling lately as its earnings have declined faster than most other companies. The P/E is probably low because investors think this poor earnings performance isn't going to improve at all. You'd much rather the company wasn't bleeding earnings if you still believe in the business. If not, then existing shareholders will probably struggle to get excited about the future direction of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Münchener Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft in München XTRA:MUV2 Price to Earnings Ratio vs Industry May 8th 2024 Keen to find out how analysts think Münchener Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft in München's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start . How Is Münchener Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft in München's Growth Trending? Münchener Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft in München's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver limited growth, and importantly, perform worse than the market. If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 11%. However, a few very strong years before that means that it was still able to grow EPS by an impressive 299% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would probably welcome the medium-term rates of earnings growth. Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 11% each year during the coming three years according to the twelve analysts following the company. With the market predicted to deliver 13% growth per year, the company is positioned for a weaker earnings result. With this information, we can see why Münchener Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft in München is trading at a P/E lower than the market. Apparently many shareholders weren't comfortable holding on while the company is potentially eyeing a less prosperous future. What We Can Learn From Münchener Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft in München's P/E? Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company. As we suspected, our examination of Münchener Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft in München's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook is contributing to its low P/E. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.

In light of this performance, CEO compensation will probably not be the main focus for shareholders as they go into the AGM on 15th of May. Here is our take on why we think the CEO compensation looks appropriate. See our latest analysis for Vossloh Comparing Vossloh AG's CEO Compensation With The Industry According to our data, Vossloh AG has a market capitalization of €833m, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth €1.9m over the year to December 2023. We note that's a small decrease of 3.8% on last year. We think total compensation is more important but our data shows that the CEO salary is lower, at €579k. For comparison, other companies in the German Machinery industry with market capitalizations ranging between €372m and €1.5b had a median total CEO compensation of €1.6m. So it looks like Vossloh compensates Oliver Schuster in line with the median for the industry. Component 2023 2022 Proportion (2023) Salary €579k €550k 31% Other €1.3m €1.4m 69% Total Compensation €1.9m €2.0m 100% Speaking on an industry level, salary and non-salary portions, both make up 50% each of the total remuneration. It's interesting to note that Vossloh allocates a smaller portion of compensation to salary in comparison to the broader industry. If non-salary compensation dominates total pay, it's an indicator that the executive's salary is tied to company performance. XTRA:VOS CEO Compensation May 9th 2024 Vossloh AG's Growth Vossloh AG's earnings per share (EPS) grew 14% per year over the last three years. In the last year, its revenue is up 14%. Shareholders would be glad to know that the company has improved itself over the last few years. It's also good to see decent revenue growth in the last year, suggesting the business is healthy and growing. Historical performance can sometimes be a good indicator on what's coming up next but if you want to peer into the company's future you might be interested in this free visualization of analyst forecasts. Has Vossloh AG Been A Good Investment? Vossloh AG has served shareholders reasonably well, with a total return of 22% over three years. But they probably wouldn't be so happy as to think the CEO should be paid more than is normal, for companies around this size. To Conclude... Seeing that the company has put up a decent performance, only a few shareholders, if any at all, might have questions about the CEO pay in the upcoming AGM. However, we still think that any proposed increase in CEO compensation will be examined closely to make sure the compensation is appropriate and linked to performance. While CEO pay is an important factor to be aware of, there are other areas that investors should be mindful of as well. That's why we did some digging and identified 1 warning sign for Vossloh that you should be aware of before investing. Important note: Vossloh is an exciting stock, but we understand investors may be looking for an unencumbered balance sheet and blockbuster returns. You might find something better in this list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt. Valuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple.

Despite this, our analysis suggests that there are some factors weakening the foundations of those good profit numbers. See our latest analysis for DATRON XTRA:DAR Earnings and Revenue History May 9th 2024 Zooming In On DATRON's Earnings As finance nerds would already know, the accrual ratio from cashflow is a key measure for assessing how well a company's free cash flow (FCF) matches its profit. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. The ratio shows us how much a company's profit exceeds its FCF. Therefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive. That is not intended to imply we should worry about a positive accrual ratio, but it's worth noting where the accrual ratio is rather high. That's because some academic studies have suggested that high accruals ratios tend to lead to lower profit or less profit growth. DATRON has an accrual ratio of 0.47 for the year to December 2023. Statistically speaking, that's a real negative for future earnings. To wit, the company did not generate one whit of free cashflow in that time. Even though it reported a profit of €4.48m, a look at free cash flow indicates it actually burnt through €12m in the last year. We also note that DATRON's free cash flow was actually negative last year as well, so we could understand if shareholders were bothered by its outflow of €12m. That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates. Our Take On DATRON's Profit Performance As we have made quite clear, we're a bit worried that DATRON didn't back up the last year's profit with free cashflow. As a result, we think it may well be the case that DATRON's underlying earnings power is lower than its statutory profit. The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider. With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for DATRON you should be mindful of and 1 of these is significant. This note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of DATRON's profit. But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae.

What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We note that Aroundtown SA ( ETR:AT1 ) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt? What Risk Does Debt Bring? Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Aroundtown How Much Debt Does Aroundtown Carry? As you can see below, Aroundtown had €14.2b of debt, at December 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, it also had €2.90b in cash, and so its net debt is €11.3b. XTRA:AT1 Debt to Equity History May 8th 2024 How Healthy Is Aroundtown's Balance Sheet? The latest balance sheet data shows that Aroundtown had liabilities of €1.54b due within a year, and liabilities of €16.9b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of €2.90b as well as receivables valued at €746.4m due within 12 months. So its liabilities total €14.8b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables. This deficit casts a shadow over the €2.27b company, like a colossus towering over mere mortals. So we definitely think shareholders need to watch this one closely. After all, Aroundtown would likely require a major re-capitalisation if it had to pay its creditors today. We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses. With a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 14.3, it's fair to say Aroundtown does have a significant amount of debt. However, its interest coverage of 3.4 is reasonably strong, which is a good sign. Investors should also be troubled by the fact that Aroundtown saw its EBIT drop by 16% over the last twelve months. If that's the way things keep going handling the debt load will be like delivering hot coffees on a pogo stick. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Aroundtown can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting. Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Aroundtown recorded free cash flow worth 79% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate. Our View To be frank both Aroundtown's net debt to EBITDA and its track record of staying on top of its total liabilities make us rather uncomfortable with its debt levels. But at least it's pretty decent at converting EBIT to free cash flow; that's encouraging. Overall, it seems to us that Aroundtown's balance sheet is really quite a risk to the business. So we're almost as wary of this stock as a hungry kitten is about falling into its owner's fish pond: once bitten, twice shy, as they say. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. We've identified 2 warning signs with Aroundtown (at least 1 which is potentially serious) , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

However, investors might be overlooking a clear opportunity or potential setback if there is no rational basis for the P/E. GEA Group certainly has been doing a good job lately as its earnings growth has been positive while most other companies have been seeing their earnings go backwards. One possibility is that the P/E is moderate because investors think the company's earnings will be less resilient moving forward. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be feeling optimistic about the future direction of the share price. See our latest analysis for GEA Group XTRA:G1A Price to Earnings Ratio vs Industry May 8th 2024 Want the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on GEA Group will help you uncover what's on the horizon. How Is GEA Group's Growth Trending? In order to justify its P/E ratio, GEA Group would need to produce growth that's similar to the market. If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 10%. This was backed up an excellent period prior to see EPS up by 283% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth. Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 6.1% each year during the coming three years according to the twelve analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 13% per annum, which is noticeably more attractive. With this information, we find it interesting that GEA Group is trading at a fairly similar P/E to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly limited growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Maintaining these prices will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the shares eventually. The Bottom Line On GEA Group's P/E Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company. Our examination of GEA Group's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its P/E as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are uncomfortable with the P/E as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support a more positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium. Having said that, be aware GEA Group is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about. Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than GEA Group .

What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that PUMA SE ( ETR:PUM ) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky. Why Does Debt Bring Risk? Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for PUMA How Much Debt Does PUMA Carry? The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at December 2023 PUMA had debt of €572.0m, up from €327.4m in one year. However, it also had €552.9m in cash, and so its net debt is €19.1m. XTRA:PUM Debt to Equity History May 8th 2024 How Healthy Is PUMA's Balance Sheet? The latest balance sheet data shows that PUMA had liabilities of €2.54b due within a year, and liabilities of €1.52b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of €552.9m as well as receivables valued at €1.40b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by €2.11b. PUMA has a market capitalization of €6.78b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution. Carrying virtually no net debt, PUMA has a very light debt load indeed. We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio). With debt at a measly 0.025 times EBITDA and EBIT covering interest a whopping 13.5 times, it's clear that PUMA is not a desperate borrower. Indeed relative to its earnings its debt load seems light as a feather. But the other side of the story is that PUMA saw its EBIT decline by 4.3% over the last year. That sort of decline, if sustained, will obviously make debt harder to handle. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if PUMA can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts . Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. In the last three years, PUMA's free cash flow amounted to 42% of its EBIT, less than we'd expect. That's not great, when it comes to paying down debt. Our View PUMA's interest cover was a real positive on this analysis, as was its net debt to EBITDA. Having said that, its EBIT growth rate somewhat sensitizes us to potential future risks to the balance sheet. When we consider all the elements mentioned above, it seems to us that PUMA is managing its debt quite well. Having said that, the load is sufficiently heavy that we would recommend any shareholders keep a close eye on it. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. We've identified 1 warning sign with PUMA , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.
