The S&P 500 dropped 6.6% in the first three weeks of April which allowed the overbought conditions to reset. The pullback was attributed to the risk-off sentiment from increasing geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel, but the technical setup also favoured the reversal. But the momentum reversed higher once again last week as the tensions eased. Economic data in the US has also remained strong, improving sentiment in the stock market. Interestingly, the focus on markets has shifted since the start of the new year. The “good data is bad” rhetoric that dominated sentiment in 2023 is no longer in effect, with equity performance and economic data currently displaying a positive relationship, even if it pushes back the expectations of rate cuts from the Fed. But, some analysts have started to show concern for the economy as the lack of a Fed pivot is expected to weigh on growth going forward. But how far could the pullback go? Paul Dietrich, the chief investment strategist at B Riley Wealth Management has issued a stark warning that the S&P 500 could plummet by 44% to approximately 2,800 points. The forecast seems slightly far fetched at this point, but it is not uncommon for a selloff to quickly gather steam once sentiment turns. The bullish bias has not yet been priced out in the short term but the pullback from the past few weeks has allowed the long-term outlook to become slightly more unclear. How the soft landing rhetoric evolves over the coming months given the Fed’s ability to cut rates will likely determine the longer-term momentum. For now, the economy seems to be holding up well despite the prolonged tightness in monetary policy. If this outlook continues, then sellers in US equities are going to struggle to garner enough momentum to turn the bias downward. However, any signs of weakness in the US economy could tip the balance in favour of the sellers, which could see a more prolonged pullback like the one predicted by Mr Dietrich.

We preview what to expect from the BOJ decision and how it might impact the USD/JPY and Nikkei 225. The Bank of Japan’s main focus is sustainably returning inflation to its 2% target. Currently, there’s mixed evidence regarding whether the central bank has achieved this outcome, and whether the conditions are in place to have re-anchored inflation expectations. The latest official CPI figures revealed headline inflation moderated to 2.2% in January, with core inflation falling to exactly 2%. While price growth is around the BOJ’s target, the trend is to the downside, with slowing economic growth – Japan teetered on the edge of recession according to the latest GDP figures – a drag on consumer prices. The picture becomes more complex when looking at the “core core CPI” in Japan, which strips out food and energy and tries to isolate demand drivers of inflation. It remains elevated and well above 2%. However, it, too, has softened. Further complicating the outlook, the latest Tokyo CPI data, which is considered a leading indicator of broader price growth in Japan, lifted to 2.5% in February, another sign of potentially re-anchored inflation expectations. A recent speech by Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda reflected uncertainty about Japan's inflation dynamics. The head of the BOJ said the central bank was searching for greater evidence of a “sustainable, stable achievement” of its inflation target, driven by a virtuous cycle between wages and prices. Recent wage data showed a larger-than-expected jump in worker pay of 2%, with expectations of ongoing strength stemming from recent employee bargaining agreements. (Source: Trading Economics) (Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results) Rates markets are pricing in a possible hike from the Bank of Japan. Swaps imply an approximately 50/50 chance of a 10 basis point move in Japan’s policy rate, which would take it to 0% and out of negative territory for the first time in eight years. Judging by the swaps curve, it’s a matter of when and not if the BOJ eventually hikes: it is indicating roughly 26 basis points of rate increases this year, or three hikes. There’s the possibility that the Bank of Japan will tighten policy at this meeting using its other tools. Speculation is mounting that the central bank could tweak or remove entirely its yield curve control policy, which was adjusted several times last year as long-term rates moved higher. There may also be a phasing out or end to part of the BOJ’s asset purchases, especially of equity and property ETFs, with Japanese asset prices hitting all-time highs recently. (Source: Bloomberg, Capital.com) (Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results) Given that the markets are implying a hike at this Bank of Japan meeting is a line ball call, the event could trigger heightened volatility in the Yen and Nikkei 225. Those markets move in a negative correlation with one another, with a hike, adjustment to other monetary policy tools, or even very hawkish language potentially strengthening the Yen and weakening the Nikkei. The opposite outcome could weaken the Yen and boost the Nikkei. (Source: Trading Economic) (Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results) The risk of a rate hike has put downward pressure on the Nikkei recently, after having recently hit record highs. The weekly chart shows the RSI has dived out of overbought conditions, suggesting a major momentum reversal. (Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results) (Source: Capital.com) The USD/JPY is also flashing bearish signals on the charts. Having failed to make new highs and possibly carving out a double-top formation, the pair is breaking lower out of an ascending wedge pattern. A weekly close below the 20-day moving average could be a bearish signal, with 145 a potential level of technical support.

A key metric to look out for when analysing bank earnings is interest income. This is the difference in the rates it charges for loans versus what it pays on deposits. During 2023 we saw interest rates rise significantly across developed economies which has allowed the interest margin to increase. However, should rates drop lower at some point this year, could revenues generated from interests drop in tandem? Here is a quick overview of what to expect from the major UK banks reporting this week. According to data from Reuters, net interest income is expected to have dropped marginally in 2023 to £13,85m from £13,95m in 2022, but it is forecasted to drop another 3% in 2024. Fourth-quarter revenue is expected to have dropped 1.9% from the previous quarter to £4,42m but full-year revenue is estimated to have risen 3.3% from 2022 to £18,64m. That said, net income is expected to have shrunk 26.4% in 2023. Earnings per share are expected to come in at £1.93 in the fourth quarter, with full-year earnings per share up 2.8% to £7.51 per share. Lloyd’s shares have been disappointing investors for most of the past year, dropping over 20% from its peak in February 2023. Concerns about economic growth in the UK have led investors to believe that the Bank of England could be making a mistake by keeping rates elevated for too long. Banks make higher interest income from higher rates, but this can also be bad news if it leads to a recession. That’s why Lloyds’ shares – as many of its peers – strengthened throughout the last few months of 2023 when markets started to price in the possibility of rate cuts on the back of falling inflation. But with an uptick in CPI in recent readings and the realisation that the UK economy slipped into a technical recession in the second half of the year, concerns about growth are back on the table as the Bank of England failed to give any future guidance on when to expect rates to be cut at their meeting on February 1st. Shares are up over 2% on Friday morning ahead of the release next week, but traders should be weary of increased resistance up ahead. Lloyds Banking Group PLC will be releasing its earnings on Thursday the 22nd. According to recent data from Reuters, Barclays’ net interest income is forecasted to have risen 20% in 2023 to £12,69m. Fourth-quarter revenue is expected to have dropped 5.4% from the previous quarter to £5,92m with full-year revenue up 2.3% to £25,51m. Full-year net income is expected to have shrunk 33% to £4,34m, whilst earnings per share are expected to have dropped 25% in 2023. Q4 earnings per share are expected to come in at £2.29, down 73% from the £8.46 delivered in Q3. Barclay’s costs will be closely looked at as it goes through a restructuring whilst making targeted acquisitions. The bank’s fixed-income earnings will also be closely monitored after disappointing results in the US. Barclays’ shares held up a little better during the pullback in January allowing the RSI to venture back into positive territory over the past few days. The momentum looks set to continue recovering on the upside over the coming days but a descending trendline is looming up ahead, placing resistance just below the £150 mark. Barclays PLC will be releasing its earnings on Tuesday the 20th. HSBC’s net interest income is forecasted to have risen 13% to £36,89m in 2023 with revenue estimated to have risen 19.8% to £66,3m. With expenses down on the year, the bank is looking to have almost doubled its net income to £25,45m. Earnings per share are forecasted to remain unchanged at £0.27 in the fourth quarter, with full-year EPS expected to have risen 44% to £1.28., according to data from Reuters The Asia-focused bank is expected to have increased its pre-tax profit significantly in 2023 defying concerns about its exposure to China’s stagnating economy. However, stagnating rates in the last few months of 2023 have likely led to weaker fourth-quarter earnings as consumers demand better deals to attract their savings. HSBC’s shares have held up significantly better in the last year, being down only 3% from the highs in February last year. The price has been consolidating within a sideways range over the past 6 months, giving traders ample opportunity but limiting the direction. The RSI has ventured into positive territory once again, but it is struggling to keep up with price, which could suggest some further weakness up ahead. For now, resistance remains steady at £663. HSBC PLC will be releasing its earnings on Wednesday the 21st.

However, every once in a while, a market will move relentlessly in one direction – steamrollering anything in its path and generating outsized profits for trend traders and damaging losses for reversal traders. A trend day emerges when the daily trading range expands significantly, with the open and close near opposite ends. The initial thirty minutes of trading typically encompass a mere fraction of the day's overall range, with minimal intraday price retracement. Here’s what a trend day looks like on a 1min candle chart: Recognising a trend day before it gains full momentum is a skill that separates astute traders from the rest. A few tell-tale signs precede these market-moving days: Trend days tend to follow one or more days with small ranges, building up tension in the market. When the market records a tight daily range, traders should be on high alert for a potential trend day next. A trend day frequently kicks off with a market gap, without an immediate attempt to fill it. This clear gap serves as a strong signal to watch out for a possible trend day. If no gap exists, traders should see a distinct directional bias during the opening rotation. On trend days, breaching the prior day's high or low often happens swiftly. Trend days exhibit a noticeable imbalance between market supply and demand, evident early in the trading day through consistently one-sided price action. This implies the market consistently stays on one side of the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP), with VWAP clearly moving in one direction. Moreover, there's a general reluctance for prices to retract on trend days. A breakout strategy, or intraday trend-following method, can best capture a trend day. Wait for the market to tip its hand first by using the early warnings signs in the section above, and then deploy simple, robust and relatively passive trend following techniques to squeeze as much from the trend as possible. A key characteristic of trend days is a reluctance to pullback, this means it is usually preferable to enter on breakouts rather than wait for pullbacks when it comes to timing entry. One method that can be used is to simply place a buy stop order to enter above the five-bar high (for bullish trend days). Trend days tend to favour being more passive and letting the trend run, which in turn favours using relatively wide, volatility-adjusted stops - Keltner Channels are a very useful tool for this. For bullish trend days an initial stop can be placed either below the basis of the Keltner Channel which is a 20-period exponential moving average (EMA) or below lower Keltner Channel depending on how much room you want to give the trend. The 20-period EMA can also be used for trailing stops to lock in profits – for example a close below the 20-period EMA on the 5-min candle chart could trigger a trailing stop. It is not uncommon for trend days to run right into the closing bell. It is also not uncommon for trend days to far exceed the daily ATR. These two factors make ‘exit on close’ or ‘exit on trailing stop’ a more optimum strategy than setting a fixed profit target.

The company reports its Q4 results after the closing bell on Wednesday, the 21st of February. We preview what to expect from Nvidia’s earnings and analyse the technicals of its stock price. According to data derived from Bloomberg (pictured below), analysts are expecting a very strong performance by Nvidia in Q4. Revenues are forecast to more than double from a year earlier to $US20.45B, underpinning a projected quadrupling in earnings to $4.60. The performance is expected to be driven by booming demand for microchips due to the extraordinary growth in generative AI. In particular, Nvidia’s growth is expected to come from its data-centre segment, which analysts expect to grow by 375% to make up more than 80% of the company's topline. The strong financial performance is forecast to carry on into the 2024 fiscal year, and in Q1. Analysts project another 351% increase in earnings next quarter, off the back of another significant lift in sales. Several risks could unsettle investors and present a potential downside for the company’s earnings. The issue of double ordering persists amidst a rush to secure chips, although that risk is arguably lower than the previous quarter as supply and demand normalise. There is also the issue of geopolitical tensions and trade restrictions after the US banned the sale of certain chips to China. Disappointing guidance regarding sales in China sent Nvidia’s share price lower after last quarter’s results. Investors will be looking for signs of progress in the production and sales of China-compliant chips. Despite arguably rich valuations, with Nvidia's price-to-sales alone an eye-watering 40/1, analysts remain optimistic about the company’s stock. According to Bloomberg data, it boasts a consensus buy rating amongst 66 analysts, with 60 making that recommendation. The consensus price target is almost precisely the current market price, suggesting the stock may be at fair value. Nvidia shares remain in an uptrend and a fraction below all-time highs. In the very short-term, sellers have emerged above $US740 per share, with a break and hold above that level a bullish signal the stock’s uptrend can continue. The daily RSI is signaling overbought conditions and a possible reversal in momentum unfolding. A confluence of levels exists around $US700, including tentative trendline support, which, if broken, could spark a deeper pullback.

We look at the fundamentals of the oil market and the technical levels of WTI. As the economic data softens in the US, oil prices have shifted to reflect a weaker demand environment in the short term. In recent weeks, OPEC+ has flagged its willingness to extend or deeper output cuts to stabilise the market. This week, the prospect of further production curbs was thrown into doubt amid reports that some cartel members oppose further reduction of output, with a handful of African members and QATAR arguing price increases would not offset the cost of lower volumes. The disunity forced OPEC+ to delay its November 26th Joint Ministerial Monitoring Meeting by four days, raising the risk that no deal will be reached to curb supply. With the demand outlook deteriorating and future supply uncertain, the futures market has remained in contango, reflecting a short-term oversupply of oil in global markets. While the dynamic is only expected to persist in the short term or could reflect speculative activity rather than underlying fundamentals, the structure of the futures market may reflect an imbalance in spot markets that requires intervention to return to equilibrium. Rising US crude inventories continue to put downward pressure on global oil prices. US stockpiles increased by 8.7 million barrels last week, exceeding the forecast of 900 thousand barrels. The dynamic points to increased capacity and moderately weaker demand, with the change in inventories in the coming weeks likely determined by the extent of demand going into the winter. Speculation regarding future OPEC+ policy has led to heightened uncertainty, volatility, and intraday ranges for WTI Crude. Buyers have emerged on dips below $73.80; sellers have defended the 20 and 200-day moving averages. Major technical support appears at around $80.50 per barrel. A push below support around $72.00 per barrel could invite more significant selling.

Walt Disney Co. reports after the market closes on Wednesday, February 7th. According to Bloomberg data, analysts expect earnings to rise 2.4% to $1.01 per share, off a modest 1.3% in the top line. Walt Disney’s performance is expected to be driven by a slowdown in its parks and recreation business as activity normalises and consumers reign in spending following the post-pandemic surge.

We preview what to expect from JP Morgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo's quarterly numbers. According to Bloomberg data, JP Morgan’s EPS is expected to rise 2% year over year in Q1 to $4.18 per share. The increase in earnings is forecast to be underpinned by a 6% lift in revenues, driven primarily by card growth. However, net interest margins are expected to fall, driven by higher costs as operating expenses rise and the diminished impact of strong economic activity and interest rate increases. Provisions are also tipped to rise due to cyclical and seasonal factors, while exposure to commercial interest rates, both from a cash flow and balance sheet perspective, could be key risks for market participants. Comments from the bank, especially CEO Jamie Dimon, about the outlook for its financial performance and the US economy might drive expectations for future growth for JP Morgan. According to Bloomberg data, Citigroup’s Q1 results will be driven by credit card revenue and investment banking fee growth and offset softening in trading revenue. EPS is tipped to fall 32% from the corresponding period a year ago to $1.27 per share. Higher operating costs related to a restructuring during the quarter are likely to impact profits. However, net interest margins are forecast to show resilience, with NIM only projected to dip by two points to 2.44%. The quantity of provisions set aside by Citigroup will be closely watched by market participants, with forecasters estimating the sum to reach $2.6 billion. (Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results) Wells Fargo is highly sensitive to retail banking and commercial real estate, with the bank’s 1Q earnings expected to be hit by softness in both segments. According to Bloomberg data, analysts expect EPS to decline to $1.08 per share on a 3% drop in revenues. Loan growth is expected to stall from a quarter ago a dip of 1%, while deposits are projected to remain nominally unchanged. Mortgage income is also expected to decline. Meanwhile, net interest margins are forecast to drop eight basis points to 2.84%. Market participants will focus on commercial real estate exposure in Wells Fargo’s quarterly results, as heavy exposure to the market risks the health of the bank’s balance sheet.

The continued drop in consumer prices has shaped expectations that there will be no more rate hikes within the developed economies, but when will the cutting begin? In Europe, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the Eurozone dropped from 4.3% to 2.9% in October, a larger drop than markets were anticipating. Coming from a peak reading of 10.6% just a year ago the drop is significant, but is it enough to convince Lagarde and her team at the European Central Bank (ECB) that rates should be lowered in order to aid the economy through this period of transition? Markets seem to think so. Market-implied pricing shows a 25% chance that rates will be cut 25bps in March 2024, with the first cut being fully priced in for the June meeting. Of course, a lot can change from here until then, with data being the most likely driver of implied pricing in the coming months. This week we will see the first reading of the November CPI being released. Forecasts from a poll by Reuters are showing expectations of a marginal drop in headline CPI to 2.8%, and core CPI dropping from 4.2% to 3.9%. If so, the drop will likely feel lacklustre when compared to the previous month, but given how messy the disinflation process can be, a smaller increase than the previous month, no matter how small, is still a victory. Meanwhile, ECB President Christine Lagarde was speaking to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament on Monday. There wasn’t much that hadn’t been said before, but she highlighted the fact that growth has started to stagnate in recent quarters and the jobs market is showing signs of softening. The latest reading showed GDP contracted by 0.1% in Q3. Lagarde also reiterated that despite the weakening of inflationary pressures, wage pressures remain elevated and the medium-term outlook for inflation is still surrounded by considerable uncertainty. The timing of the first rate cut is going to be key. In recent months, many economists have been voicing their concerns about cutting rates too early. Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel said in a speech two weeks ago that “it would be unwise to start cutting interest rates too soon. We must not loosen policy until we are absolutely certain of returning to price stability on a lasting basis.\" Austria's Robert Holzmann went as far as pinpointing a date, saying that the second quarter is simply too soon for a rate cut. He added that he was trying to communicate to markets that they should not believe that this is the end of the story on rate hikes. The general consensus amongst policymakers seems to be that they would rather err on the side of caution and not loosen policy until they are absolutely certain of returning to price stability on a long-lasting basis. EUR/USD continues to eke out the gains in recent sessions. That said, most of the momentum has come from the dollar side of the trade. The continued weakness in US data has led markets to believe the Fed will hike no further and will potentially need to start cutting rates soon. Regardless of how it turns out, the possibility of upcoming rate cuts has ended the dollar’s 3-month dominance in FX markets as yields adjust lower. The bias remains lower in USD which allows the bullish view for EUR/USD to continue in the short-term. The Euro Zone CPI data may provide some opportunity for traders. It seems pretty hard at this point to determine direction based on the outcome of the data. On the one side, a drop in CPI is likely welcomed by EUR traders as it improves risk sentiment towards the state of the bloc’s economy. However, markets may be concerned about rates being cut too soon and therefore may be cautious if the drop in CPI is larger-than-expected. It’s likely that for EUR/USD the best outcome would be that the Fed cut rates before the ECB, or at least that markets continue to believe that that will be the case.

We preview what to expect from Tesla, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft’s quarterly results. Tesla enters the reporting season out of favour amongst investors as several headwinds build for the company. As Bloomberg data reveals (below), analysts estimate revenue declined by 3.4% in Q1, with EPS estimated to drop by 26.4% to $0.54 per share. Tesla's sales have slowed, while profit margins are eroding as the business deals with higher costs and the impacts of a more aggressive pricing strategy. Tesla has lowered prices to defend market share from legacy automakers and challenger brands in China. However, the cuts have failed to boost sales volumes and defend market share. Recent delivery data underwhelmed expectations and revealed the first year-over-year decline since 2020. Deliveries in Q1 declined to around 387,000, with the impacts of supply disruptions – including snarled supply chains – as well as weaker demand for Tesla’s cars causing the fall. Following the delivery data, Tesla announced that it would be laying off 10% of its staff, with CEO Elon Musk explaining the decision was made to lower costs, boost productivity, and prepare the automaker for its next growth phase. Despite the announcement, Tesla’s share price closed lower on the day it was made. Analysts are as bearish on Tesla stock as at any point in the last two years: the company boasts a consensus “sell” rating. However, the consensus price target remains a premium to current prices, at $187.36 per share. Tesla reports after the closing bell on Tuesday, April 23, 2024. Alphabet is expected to deliver strong growth in the first quarter, supported by the performance of the company’s cloud services business. According to analyst consensus data compiled by Bloomberg (below), Alphabet is tipped to report EPS of $1.52 in Q1, a 30.1% increase, underpinned by revenue of $US79.1 billion. Advertising revenue remains Alphabet’s biggest segment, with a resilient US consumer supporting ongoing strength in sales for the quarter. However, the company’s cloud services are the major growth driver, with analysts expecting a more than 25% increase in revenues for Q1 as the tech giant executes its artificial intelligence strategy. Investors will be keenly watching Alphabet’s guidance and whether it is and can continue to execute on advances in AI strategy, particularly whether the company can generate increased revenues while keeping operating expenses and capital expenditures at moderate levels. Analysts remain very bullish on the outlook for Alphabet stock, boasting a consensus buy rating. Out of 65 brokers, 55 recommend buying the stock, while the remaining suggest holding. The consensus price target of $168.77 is at a premium to current valuations. Alphabet reports after the closing bell on Tuesday, April 23, 2024. Based on Bloomberg data (below), analysts expect Meta to continue its trend of resurgent earnings growth. The consensus estimate among brokers implies Meta’s earnings will grow 95% to $4.29, with revenues projected to rise by more than 26%, primarily due to the platform’s app business. The strong performance is expected to come from an increase in average revenue per user, with solid, but historically modest, active user growth between three and four percent enhanced by generating higher advertising sales on a user-by-user basis. Much of this improvement is expected to come from the efficiencies delivered by artificial intelligence integration. Meta’s earnings are also expected to be bolstered by a more disciplined approach to capital expenditure and cost management, with operating margins significantly higher than a year ago, albeit down from the previous quarter. Analysts project resilient growth moving forward, although improvements in the top line and bottom line are forecast to moderate. The outlook for Meta will be determined by its ability to capitalise on AI technology and grow revenue per user while keeping capital expenditure under control. Overall, analysts are bullish on Meta’s stock. 62 brokers give it a buy rating, and seven give it a hold. Two, however, suggest selling the stock at current prices. The consensus price target is at a lofty premium of $545.29 per share. Meta Platforms report after the closing bell on Wednesday, April 24, 2024. Microsoft’s fiscal Q3 is expected to reveal ongoing strong growth driven by artificial intelligence and the cloud services business. Bloomberg data (below) implies analysts expect adjusted EPS to rise 15% to $2.83 from a comparable rate of topline growth. Cloud revenues are expected to drive earnings growth. Intelligent cloud revenues are expected to top $26.25 billion – a growth rate of nearly 19% – with artificial intelligence integration, powered by Microsoft’s acquisition of open AI, driving the solid performance. Revenue growth in Microsoft’s other business segments, especially personal computing, is forecast to be positive, although likely to continue to reveal consolidation. According to Bloomberg surveys, analysts remain very bullish on Microsoft shares. The stock boasts a consensus “buy” rating, with 92.5% of analysts making that recommendation and the remaining giving a “hold rating”. The consensus price target is a significant premium at $472.57. Microsoft reports its Q3 earnings on Thursday, April 25, in post-market trade. Tech stocks have pulled back going into earnings, with a mixture of weaker sentiment stemming from geopolitical risks and the pricing out of US rate cuts this year weakening valuations. The NASDAQ—which Capital.com’s clients can trade via the US Tech 100—has seen its primary uptrend breakdown as momentum turns to the downside. Having broken support (now potential resistance) at approximately 17,400, the index has bounced off technical support just below 17,000. If that level were to break, a confluence of support levels, including the 200-day moving average, exists around 16,250.

According to the ASX’s RBA Rate Indicator, there is a 2% chance of a lift in the cash rate, with a 98% implied probability the cash rate remains at 4.35%. The odds of a rate hike fell following last week’s monthly CPI indicator. It revealed headline price growth moderated to 4.9% in October, falling to its lowest level since the beginning of 2022. The more critical trimmed mean figure, which strips out more volatile items, is falling more slowly; the latest data suggests it rose by 5.3% last month, dipping from 5.4% in September. Economic data paints a mixed picture for the broader Australian economy. The labour market is weakening slightly; however, the unemployment rate remains near 50-year lows at 3.7%, with October’s labour force data revealing a much larger than expected 55,000 jobs added to the economy. Meanwhile, Retail Sales surprisingly contracted by 0.2% for the month, possibly signalling weaker household consumption – although it could be due to deferred spending ahead of the November discounting season. The RBA’s meeting arrives one day before the September National Accounts, which is forecast to reveal a fall in the GDP growth rate for the quarter to 1.7% y/y, according to a survey of economists conducted by Reuters. Expectations for rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve have weakened the US Dollar and pushed the AUD/USD to four-month highs. The pair is approaching a critical technical level at long-term downward sloping trend-line resistance.

Data from Reuters shows a 90% chance of no change to the current rate of 5.25%, but the central bank will need to decide whether to change the messaging about rate cuts this year as traders will be paying close attention to any rate-cut clues. Current pricing shows 53 basis points of cuts in 2024, with the first cut coming in August, followed by a second one in December. This could well change in the coming months as the data evolves, which means we may see more than two cuts if the data worsens significantly, or less than two if the economy remains resilient and the disinflation process stalls. How the BoE sees the path of interest rates evolving this year will likely be what investors will be trying to find out on Thursday. So far, the labour market is still generating inflationary pressures, which is limiting the central bank’s ability to start cutting rates. Growth in consumer prices (CPI) has dropped significantly over the past 12 months, but it remains above the long-term 2% target and may be at risk of stalling in the last leg of the disinflation process. But Governor Andrew Bailey remains confident that the Bank of England will be able to deliver rate cuts in 2024, even if fewer than originally hoped for. He reasons that the April CPI data will show a big drop when it is released on 22 May. There is a big risk of policy error in the coming months if expectations are not handled correctly, so Bailey and his team will need to be as forthcoming as possible with their messaging without giving away when they expect to start cutting rates. The meeting on Thursday will include an updated monetary policy report so investors will be able to gauge how the economy is expected to evolve given the latest data. When it comes to the pound, the main driver will likely be how the BoE’s policy direction differs from other central banks. For GBP/USD, the British central bank is expected to start cutting rates sooner than the Federal Reserve, given the resilience of the US economy. This is expected to continue to exert downward pressure on the pair, limiting the potential for further advances. That said, the short-term momentum has been building higher over the past few weeks and has comfortably settled above 1.25. If the takeaway from the meeting on Thursday is dovish, then GBP/USD could retrace some of the cement bullishness, potentially dropping back below 1.24 over the coming days. Alternatively, a hawkish BoE meeting would likely push back expectations of rate cuts, which could cement the recent bullishness in GBP/USD in an attempt to close above 1.26.

One key driver behind the rally is the stellar performance of Apple's services segment. The robust growth in services, highlighted by impressive numbers from the App Store, iCloud, and AppleCare, has significantly boosted profits. This success in the services sector has instilled confidence among investors, showcasing Apple's ability to diversify its revenue streams beyond hardware sales. Additionally, the market is optimistic about Apple's resilience in navigating challenges, particularly in China. Despite a 2.5% decline in revenue from Greater China, CEO Tim Cook's defence of the company's position in this market, emphasising gains in market share during a contracting overall market, has reassured investors. Furthermore, anticipation surrounding the potential recovery in hardware sales, especially with the release of the iPhone 15, has also played a role in bolstering Apple's share price. While hardware sales faced challenges leading to a 1% revenue dip, investors are eyeing a turnaround with expectations of a rebound in sales, particularly with the launch of the new iPhone model. Let’s start our technical analysis by looking at the bigger picture on the weekly candle chart (below). On this higher timeframe we can see that Apple’s recent price action has reignited its long-term uptrend… During the last week, Apple’s share price has broken out from a descending wedge consolidation pattern which had been in place since the summer. This breakout has also taken prices back above the 2022 highs – indicating that Apple’s long-term uptrend has kicked back into gear. Zooming into the daily candle chart shows that Apple’s recent rally has taken prices towards the top of the Keltner Channel – signalling that prices could be due for a period of mean reversion. However, given the bullish higher timeframe context, swing traders could potentially use any pullback in Apple’s share price to enter long and rejoin the trend. Apple has an Average True Range (ATR) of $3.17 – traders can use this as a baseline expectation for daily price movement and factor this into to stop placement and price targets. On the economic calendar, today’s U.S inflation data could increase the volatility of U.S listed stocks like Apple.

It is unique in that it combines both price and volume data to provide a weighted average, reflecting not just where a stock has traded but also the volume at each price level. TradingView make it easy to add VWAP to your charts. Simply type VWAP into the indicators search bar. The VWAP line will appear as a continuous line on your chart, indicating the average price levels for the day. It offers a moving average of the price throughout the day, with the line calculated using intraday price data from the market open to the close. VWAP is typically viewed on day trading timeframes (5min and 1min candle charts). VWAP resets at the open of each day, for this reason VWAP tends to become more useful as the trading day progresses. Here’s how VWAP typically looks on your intraday price chart: VWAP is a powerful tool for analysing market sentiment, helping day traders understand the prevailing mood of the market. Here's how it works: When the current price of a stock is holding above the VWAP line, it is often interpreted as a sign of bullish sentiment. This suggests that, on average, traders are willing to pay prices higher than the average daily price - indicating that buyers are in control. Conversely, when the price of a stock is below the VWAP, it indicates bearish sentiment. In this scenario, traders are willing to pay prices lower than the average daily price, implying that sellers are in control. Examples: In a trending market, where a stock is moving in a clear upward or downward direction, VWAP serves as dynamic support and resistance. Here's how day traders use VWAP in this context: When a stock consistently trades above the VWAP line, VWAP acts as a dynamic support level. This means that, on average, the price of the stock remains above the VWAP, indicating a positive sentiment. Traders can use VWAP as a reference point to enter long positions, set stop-loss orders just below it, and potentially ride the trend for further gains. Conversely, when a stock remains below the VWAP, VWAP acts as dynamic resistance. This suggests that the average trading price for the day is above the current price, signifying a bearish sentiment. Traders can use VWAP as a reference point for entering short positions and managing risk by setting stop-loss orders just above it. In both cases, VWAP serves as a dynamic level that adapts to the intraday price movements, providing guidance on when to enter trades and where to place protective stops. Examples: VWAP can be particularly valuable in identifying extremes in a sideways or range-bound market. An upper and lower band can be placed 2 standard deviations above and below the VWAP line (click settings on your VWAP indicator on TradingView to add the bands). Here's how day traders use VWAP to spot market extremes: When a stock's price significantly extends above the upper VWAP band, it signals that price is more than 2 standard deviations away from the true average price for that day – leaving the stock vulnerable to mean reversion. Day traders can interpret this as a potential market extreme, suggesting that the stock may be overbought in the short term. This could be a signal for traders to consider taking profits on long positions or potentially entering short positions, anticipating a mean-reversion move back toward the VWAP. Conversely, when a stock's price significantly drops below the lower VWAP band, it could signal overselling or excessive bearish sentiment. In this case, day traders may view it as a potential market extreme, indicating that the stock may be undervalued in the short term. This could be a signal for traders to consider taking profits on short positions or potentially entering long positions, expecting a mean-reversion move back toward the VWAP. Example: In summary, VWAP, the Volume Weighted Average Price, is a valuable tool in a day trader's toolbox. It offers insights into market sentiment, dynamic support and resistance levels in trending markets, and extreme market conditions in sideways markets. As you continue your day trading journey, consider incorporating VWAP into your trading strategy to gain a deeper understanding of market dynamics.

These results fell short of market expectations, which had anticipated earnings of $4 billion. Today’s results were BP’s first since the resignation of CEO Bernard Looney in September. Looney's resignation was prompted by his failure to disclose past relationships with colleagues. Interim CEO Murray Auchincloss highlighted the company's strong operational performance, noting that oil and gas production was 3% higher than the previous year, and production costs were 6% lower. However, these positive operational aspects could not fully offset the impact of lower prices for BP's hydrocarbons and lower-than-expected results from its gas trading operations. Despite the sharp decline in earnings, BP continued with its share buyback program, announcing plans to repurchase an additional $1.5 billion of shares. The market's initial response to BP's results has been negative, with the stock dropping more than 22p. To put this price movement in perspective, BP's Average True Range (ATR) is 13p, which means today's gap down is more than 1.5 times the magnitude of a typical trading day for BP. This morning's negative gap has taken prices back to the 200-day moving average (MA), a closely watched metric for long-term investors. The move lower has also brought prices closer to short-term swing support created by the early-October swing lows. If BP manages to rally during today's session and close this morning's gap, it would be viewed as a very bullish sign. However, if the shares fail to close the gap, it would signal that short-term momentum remains bearish. The release of financial results tends to amplify a stock's volatility. For those considering trading BP, the ATR serves as a valuable tool to help traders account for a stock's volatility when setting stop losses and limit orders.

The Opening Range Breakout strategy comes into play when the market establishes a well-defined range within the first hour of trading. The initial and critical step in this strategy is defining the opening range. The method for determining the opening range may vary for different assets, such as stocks and indices or the forex market. Stocks and cash indices with set opening and closing times make defining the opening range relatively straightforward. We are looking for a range to develop within the first hour of trading – the more obvious the range the better. It's important to acknowledge that a range may not always form within the first hour of trading. In such cases, the Opening Range Breakout strategy would not usually be applied by traders using this strategy. Forex is the market that never sleeps, this means the New York close rolls straight into the Asian open – making defining the opening range much more subjective. For most major forex pairs, volume will be lower during the Asian session, increase in early European trading, before away during late morning and increasing again during U.S. trading hours. There are many interpretations and definitions of the opening range breakout strategy for forex pairs, but perhaps the cleanest method is using the lower volume Asian session as a window in which a range can form. If you've read our Day Traders Toolbox Part 1 on Previous Day High and Low (PDH/PDL), you understand the significance of these levels in shaping day trading strategies. The location of the opening range concerning PDH/PDL plays a pivotal role in shaping the expectations and management of the Opening Range Breakout strategy. Assuming PDH represents resistance and PDL signifies support, the relative distance between the opening range and PDH/PDL dictates whether long or short positions are more appealing. Should an opening range form above the PDH, this strategy suggests longs will be more attractive as the market is consolidating in a position of strength. The opposite applies to when an opening range forms below the prior days low – the market is consolidating in a position of weakness and therefore shorts might look more attractive. Once a clear range has emerged within your defined opening window, and you've assessed the range's location relative to PDH/PDL, it's a matter of waiting for and executing a breakout when it occurs. A breakout can occur either to the upside or the downside. Consider placing price alerts on both sides of the range to ensure you capture the breakout. Be aware that breakouts from opening ranges may not always be clean. Noise and false breakouts can occur. Therefore, one of the best entry techniques for trading the opening range breakout is the 'Break & Retest' method, as outlined in our Power Patterns series. This approach waits for the breakout to occur and enters during the first pullback. You may want to consider positioning your stop within the opening range to account for potential market noise. Advanced traders may consider employing the Average True Range (ATR) for more precise stop placement, as discussed in our Day Traders Toolbox: Part 3 on ATR. A sound starting point for determining profit targets in the Opening Range Breakout strategy is using the PDH/PDL and daily ATR. If the breakout happens within the prior day's range, set PDH/PDL as initial targets. If the breakout extends beyond the prior day's range, consider using 1 x Daily ATR as your initial target. Tesla establishes an opening range during the first hour of trading above the PDH, indicating strength. The range is broken to the upside, and the market retests the upper boundary, offering an entry opportunity. A stop is placed within the opening range, and an initial target of 1 x ATR is reached as the price climbs. TSLA 5min Candle Chart: Tesla forms an opening range just above the PDL. A break and retest of the opening range triggers the entry. A stop is positioned above PDL and within the opening range to accommodate market noise. The initial target of 1 x ATR is achieved as the price descends.

Geely, a long-standing admirer of Aston Martin, had previously made multiple attempts to acquire the company. In May, Geely acquired 42 million shares from Aston Martin's ownership consortium, solidifying their investment while providing components and technology to the automaker. However, recent market dynamics have caused Aston Martin's share price to reverse course, experiencing a substantial pullback from its summer peak of nearly £4. This extended retracement has brought the stock into close proximity to a cluster of support levels. Firstly, there's the gap that emerged in May after Geely's investment, which has now been closed. During the recent gap-closure phase, several long-tailed bullish hammer candles have appeared, indicating potential reversal signals. Secondly, the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) anchored to the key October lows assumes significance, as it reflects the average price of buyers who entered just before the Geely rumours surfaced. Lastly, we find swing support, which represents the psychologically important £2 level. This confluence of support levels is likely to attract the attention of long-term investors, and it remains to be seen whether it will be sufficient to reverse the recent pullback. It's essential to remember that support and resistance levels serve as guides and are not foolproof guarantees. While technical analysis is valuable, it should complement fundamental analysis. It's noteworthy that Aston Martin is currently a loss-making company, making it susceptible to short sellers. Additionally, please take into account that Aston Martin is scheduled to release its Q3 2023 Earnings on Wednesday, November 1st.

The Federal Reserve, led by Chair Jay Powell, has acknowledged a \"range of uncertainties\" in the US economy. Consequently, Powell has pledged to proceed with caution when considering changes to interest rates, indicating a likely continuation of the current rate of 5.5% in the near term. On Thursday, it will be the Bank of England's turn. Their concerns revolve around persistent high inflation and the fragility of the UK's economy. In response to these economic challenges, they are expected to mirror the Fed and maintain the interest rate at 5.25%. On the daily candle chart (below), cable remains entrenched in a clear downtrend. The broken June swing lows have now become resistance, with prices forming two lower swing highs over the past month. This pattern suggests that as cable consolidates, it is trending toward the October lows, potentially forming a bearish descending triangle. On the hourly candle chart (below), it's evident that cable is currently retracing last week's downward move, which occurred between Tuesday (24th) and Thursday (26th). The market is encountering resistance at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, with other key Fibonacci retracement levels (50% and 78.6%) closely watched by short-term traders. Interest rate decisions can significantly impact short-term volatility in currency pairs. For those considering trading GBP/USD, the Average True Range (ATR) serves as a valuable tool to help traders adjust stop losses and limit orders to account for the currency pair's volatility.

Without delving into the ATR formula, it's important to understand that this indicator takes price gaps into account. This factor provides traders with an authentic representation of market volatility. On TradingView, the ATR indicator appears as a line underneath your chart. And whilst it can be calculated on any timeframe, we typically talk about ATR in terms of the daily timeframe – hence ATR will tell us how much we can expect a stock to move up or down in typical trading day. Have you ever found yourself drawn to the lists of top gainers and losers on stock trading platforms? It's a common fascination for novice traders, as these lists provide quick summaries of what's \"hot\" on any given day. However, seasoned traders know that evaluating stock prices solely based on percentage movements is about as practical as a paper umbrella in a rainstorm. To illustrate this point, consider two stocks, Stock A and Stock B, both opening with a 3% increase. Yet, Stock A typically fluctuates by 3% on an average day, while Stock B usually moves by 1.5%. In this context, Stock B's price movement is far more significant. This is where ATR comes into play. ATR normalises market price movements, making it a valuable tool for comparing a stock's price changes against its historical performance and its peer group. So, it's time to shift your perspective. Leave behind the world of percentage-based analysis and adopt ATR to see price movement through the eyes of a professional trader. Consider this day trading scenario: The market has broken above its previous day's high (PDH), and the price is showing signs of consolidation while staying above VWAP. With these clear signals of strength and insights from your higher timeframe analysis, you decide to go long. Now, the question is, where do you place your profit target? Answer: As a day trader, your goal is to capitalise on intraday price movements and avoid holding positions overnight, thereby mitigating overnight risks. This means that setting a structural target, such as the next resistance level, may not be practical. However, if you incorporate the daily ATR with the current day's low, it provides you with an exceptionally realistic profit target. This target is entirely objective and calibrated to the specific market's current level of volatility. It's important to note that ATR is an average, so it should be used as a guide rather than an absolute rule. Nevertheless, having a tool to adjust your profit expectations is invaluable, especially in the emotionally charged environment of day trading. Example: In swing trading, where positions are held over several trading sessions to capture price swings, using multiples of the ATR for stop placement is a smart strategy. It helps keep your stops outside of market noise and enhances risk management. However, when it comes to day trading, it's understandable that stops need to be considerably smaller. But that doesn't mean we can't use ATR to fine-tune our stop loss levels according to market volatility. Day traders can benefit from using a multiple of a lower timeframe ATR to establish a volatility-adjusted stop loss. This approach is often more effective than simply placing a stop below the nearest level of support. For day traders using a 5-minute candle chart, a stop set at 10 times the ATR on this timeframe is a reasonable starting point. Keep in mind that ATR serves as a normaliser of price movement across different markets. Using ATR for stop placement allows for consistency in risk management across the various markets you trade. For day traders who prefer locking in profits as a trade moves in their favour, an ATR trailing stop can be an invaluable tool. It trails the stop a certain number of ATRs below the close of a specified number of bars, dynamically adjusting to the market's volatility. TradingView offers numerous ATR trailing stop indicators just search for “ATR Trailing Stop” in the indicators tab. Example: Just as ATR proves invaluable in setting realistic profit targets calibrated to market volatility, it also serves as an objective measure to define when a market is overextended. There are various methods to use ATR for this purpose, but one of the most straightforward approaches involves Keltner Channels, which envelop an ATR band on either side of an exponential moving average. When the price moves beyond the boundaries of the Keltner Channels, it is considered overextended. Day traders can experiment with Keltner Channel settings. The standard setup involves using 2.5 times the ATR wrapped around a 20-period exponential moving average. Wider bands (a higher ATR multiplier) across a longer period of the moving average generate fewer signals, while narrower bands across a shorter period produce more signals. Incorporating Keltner Channels, in conjunction with support and resistance levels, provides an additional layer of confirmation for day traders, enhancing their ability to assess overextension in the market. Example: In summary, ATR is a versatile tool for day traders, helping them navigate volatile markets with precision. It aids in setting realistic profit targets, fine-tuning stop placement, and identifying market overextension. By incorporating ATR into your trading strategy, you can make informed decisions and manage risk more effectively.

They signify the highest and lowest prices a market touched during the prior trading session. However, don't underestimate their significance. These levels are pivotal because they offer undeniable historical context for a market's price movement. As a result, they draw the attention of many market participants, increasing the likelihood of non-random price action at these levels. Here's why PDH and PDL stand out as the two most vital price lines a day trader can mark on their chart. PDH and PDL offer an objective glimpse into market sentiment, which holds immense value when formulating your daily trade plan. During the first hours trading, if the market comfortably holding above the PDH it is a clear sign of strength while failure to hold above the PDL is a clear sign of weakness. Just being aware of this simple concept can help keep day traders on the right side of the market. Here’s some examples: Traders use PDH and PDL to set stop-loss orders, take-profit levels, and as reference points for assessing the risk-reward ratio of a trade. Given the close attention PDH and PDL receive, they often act as both support and resistance levels, making them prime zones for potential price reversals. A reversal pattern forming at PDH or PDL typically carries greater significance than one occurring within the prior day's range. And should a market break and hold above the PDH, it can then provide support when the level is retested. Conversely, a break below PDL may offer resistance when the market trades below it. Here’s some examples: Take note of the compelling examples above. No additional indicators clutter the chart. Armed only with an understanding of how price reacts to PDH and PDL, you can make smart day trading decisions. For a deeper understanding, add PDH and PDL to your price charts and explore your own instances. You'll be astonished by how the market consistently responds to these levels. Here are some practical tips for using PDH and PDL effectively in day trading: Before you start trading, identify the PDH and PDL levels for the market you are trading. You can draw these levels on yourself or type in ‘Previous Day High and Low’ into the Indicators, Metrics and Strategies bar on Trading View – here you will find a number of scripts that will add PDH and PDL to your charts automatically. Using the concepts outlined in section one ‘Understanding PDH and PDL’, you can create a game plan for the trading day based upon where price is trading in relation to PDH or PDL. For example, if price has opened within the prior days range the day trader may look to take bearish reversal patterns at the PDH and bullish reversal patterns at the PDL. Alternatively, if price is comfortably holding above PDH, the day trader may look to buy pullbacks. PDH and PDL are even more powerful when used in conjunction with other technical indicators such as Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP), moving averages, RSI and many other. This can help validate your trading decisions. Use PDH and PDL as reference points to set stop-loss and take-profit orders. This helps manage risk and lock in profits. Keep an eye on news and events that could impact the market. Unexpected news can sometimes cause price gaps that bypass PDH or PDL. The best way to become proficient in using PDH and PDL is through practice. Use Replay mode on Trading View to scroll through and replay many different trading days and hone your skills. In summary, the Previous Day's High (PDH) and Previous Day's Low (PDL) are foundational tools for day traders. They offer valuable insights into market sentiment, help identify potential reversal points, and act as key support and resistance levels. By incorporating these levels into your daily trade plan, you can make more informed and strategic decisions, keeping you on the right side of the market.

We preview what the markets are expecting heading into the results. As per Reuters estimates, earnings per share are expected to come in at $3.63 for Q4, up from $2.98 in Q2 and $1.64 in Q32022. Net income is forecasted to be the highest since Q4 in 2021 as advertisement revenue is expected to come in at an all-time high of $32.98B. The company’s cost-cutting measures are expected to have paid off with SG&A expenses expected to have dropped over 30% in the past year, followed by a 12% drop in selling and marketing expenses, as per forecasts from Reuters. This, coupled with growing revenue – which is expected to have grown 21% in the year – is leading to high expectations about Meta’s Q3 earnings. It’s also likely that the AI drive has helped advertising engagement and strengthened its digital ad marketing heading into the holiday season. It's likely that markets will pay close attention to Meta’s monthly active users across its family of products as the social media giant faces strong competition from other platforms like TikTok and BeReal. Analysts polled by Reuters continue to be bullish on Meta’s stock, with 89% opting for a strong buy or buy recommendation. The consensus target price is currently at $362, roughly 17% higher than where it currently stands. Earnings in Q2 beat expectations and boosted Meta’s stock higher back in July, reaching an 18-month high at $326. The momentum was quickly reversed leading the stock to drop 13% in the first 3 weeks of Q3. Since then, buyers have come back in as the big tech stocks continue to dominate the playing field and the stock has once again pushed above the yearly highs. The short term continues to be skewed to the upside but recent concerns about the escalation of tensions in the Middle East, coupled with a continued rise in US yields and a hawkish Fed, have weighed on sentiment and shifted the momentum lower once again. As mentioned above, based on polls carried out by Reuters, analyst consensus is for the stock to rise towards $362 over the coming months.

This decline was primarily attributed to sluggish revenue growth in its UK retail division and lackluster performance in its investment bank, impacted by a shortage of M&A deals and reduced trading activity. However, Barclays managed to exceed expectations by achieving a net profit of £1.3 billion. The bank also sustained a 5% increase in overall group revenue, reaching £6.3 billion, aligning with market projections. Notably, Barclays allocated fewer funds for bad loans than the market had predicted. The UK retail division experienced a 3% dip in attributable profit, mainly due to customers shifting deposits away from higher-interest-rate products. Barclays anticipates a decrease in its net interest margin for 2023, now expected to fall within the range of 3.05% to 3.10%, down from the previous guidance of 3.2% to 3.15%. This metric is one to watch, especially with domestic peers like NatWest and Lloyds Banking Group preparing to report their quarterly results soon. In the investment bank, income decreased by 6% to £3.1 billion when adjusted for a bond overissuance error from last year. Fixed-income trading saw a notable 26% decline, while equity trading revenue more than doubled. Advisory and capital markets fees dropped by 30% due to fewer takeover deals and reduced debt issuance. The market has so far responded negatively to Barclays' Q3 results, causing a share price to gap lower at the opening of today's trading session. Interestingly, this price gap breached two levels of horizontal support that were established by the summer swing lows. This negative gap is likely to create a layer of resistance on Barclays' price chart in the future. Prices now appear poised to retest the lows seen during the Silicon Valley banking crisis spike that occurred in March (see chart below). Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results. The release of financial results tends to amplify a stock's volatility. For those considering trading Barclays, the Average True Range (ATR) serves as a valuable tool to help traders account for a stock's volatility when setting stop losses and limit orders.

Revenue (ex-TAC) EPS Ad. revenue 4Q EPS Guidance Estimate $63.04B (10.1%) $1.44 (36.6%) $58.9B (8.1%) $1.64 (55.79%) (Source: Bloomberg) According to data from Bloomberg, broker analysts expect a solid financial performance from Alphabet in Q3, driven by a continued recovery in ad revenues. 2022 saw a historic drop in sales generated from advertising for Alphabet, with the company’s growth this quarter likely to be bolstered by favourable base effects. According to the Bloomberg data, revenue (excluding traffic acquisition costs) is tipped to rise 10.1% to $63.04B; ad revenues are expected to lift 8.1% to $58.9B. The tech giant’s top-line recovery is projected to underpin a 36.6% rebound in earnings per share to $1.44. The revival in advertising revenue comes despite crosswinds from the emergence of artificial intelligence. On the one hand, Alphabet is moving to integrate AI technology into its products and stands to benefit from its AI trading service. However, the emergence of ChatGPT and other competitor products threatens to disrupt Alphabet’s market dominance achieved through Google. Data compiled by Bloomberg suggest analysts expect continued earnings recovery in the short term: the consensus estimate for Q4 EPS guidance is $1.64, which represents a 55.8% rise. According to surveys conducted by Bloomberg, the broker community remains very bullish toward Alphabet’s stock. Of 62 analysts, 54 favour buying the stock, with the remaining suggesting a hold. The consensus price target is at a meaningful premium of $153.11. Alphabet’s share price has trended higher this year, supported by the multiple expansion inflated by the hype surrounding artificial intelligence. More recently, upside momentum has slowed, in significant part due to the recent rise in bond yields that have hurt tech stocks.

A price gap occurs when a stock \"gaps\" higher or lower from its previous closing price when the market opens. The price gap represents a shock and in certain circumstances traders can anticipate a continuation of price movement in the direction of the price gap. Here are the key components of the Gap & Go trade setup: The first step is to identify stocks that exhibit a noticeable price gap between the previous day's closing price and the current day's opening price. This gap can be either bullish (a gap up) or bearish (a gap down). The price gap should break above or below a level of resistance (or support). Gaps that break key structural levels are likely to draw in a higher level of participation. The price gap should occur on higher-than-average volume. Higher volume indicates increased participation and suggests that a significant number of market participants are actively reacting to the news or event that caused the gap. Stock prices can gap higher or lower for a multitude of reasons and some of the reasons make better trading catalysts than others. As a general rule, you want the gap to form on a piece of stock-specific newsflow that has recalibrated market expectations. Remember, central to the pattern working is that the shock which caused the gap must take time to price in – hence mechanical events such as dividends and corporate actions are of no use, so too are confirmed bids. The best catalysts for Gap & Go trades will be earnings surprises (good or bad), and a change in outlook (good or bad). In general, trading updates tend to lead to more surprises that Interim and Annual Reports, as they occur within reporting periods. For the stocks you like to trade, make sure you add a calendar alert for when the company releases Trading Updates and Interim/Annual Reports. This may help you to anticipate price gaps. Whilst the Gap & Go pattern can be traded in many different ways and on many different timeframes. We favour getting to grips with this pattern on the hourly candle chart first. On this timeframe gaps will be clear, levels of risk can be kept relatively small, and trades can play out across one or two trading days. Here’s how to start trading the Gap & Go on the hourly candle chart: : Wait for prices to stabilise following the opening rotations. The gap should be maintained after the first hour of trading and there should be no signs of exhaustion. Enter during the second hour of trading. : Traders can either place a stop above (or below) the 9 period exponential moving average (EMA) or use a multiple of the Average True Range (ATR) above (or below) the entry price. : The expectation for the Gap & Go trade setup is to catch a clean swing of price movement in the direction of the gap. For this reason, the 9EMA is a useful tool as a dynamic profit target – traders should close their position on a close back above (or below) the 9EMA. This method does not cap upside in fast moving markets but ensure discipline and allows traders to attempt to capture the ‘meat of the move’. It is important that prices stabilise and maintain the gap before entering a Gap & Go trade. On occasions, prices will gap lower only to reverse sharply during the first hour of trading. The stronger your understanding of the subtle nuances of trading around the open, the better you will be at trading the Gap & Go pattern. The Gap & Go pattern by definition is trading during an expansion in volatility. Therefore, it is essential that traders implement proper risk management techniques, such as position sizing and diversifying your trading portfolio.

We preview what the markets are expecting heading into the results. As per data sourced by Reuters, earnings per share are expected to come in slightly lower in the third quarter, mostly because of precited higher costs offsetting higher revenues. The second quarter beat expectations across the board as most segments in Amazon’s business model topped estimates. The data also shows total revenue is expected to have grown 11.28% year-on-year. Advertising revenue is expected to show yearly growth of 19.7% whilst Amazon web services (AWS) – its cloud computing business – is expected to have grown 12.4% in the year. AWS is expected to be a big driver going forward as the AI revolution is expected to continue. There is still room for Amazon to grow in the e-commerce space. According to data published by the US Department of Commerce, in the second quarter, despite the rapid growth of online sales, which was accelerated by the pandemic, e-commerce only accounted for around 15% of retail sales in the US. Based on this data, Amazon is in a good position to continue growing and dominating the space as it continues to branch out into other sectors like cloud services, advertising, and physical stores. 18 33 2 0 0 $170.30 Analysts polled by Reuters continue to be strongly bullish on Amazon’s stock with 96% opting for a strong buy or buy recommendation. The consensus target price is currently at $170.30, roughly 36% higher than where it currently stands. The Big Tech reports come at a time when US yields are pushing to 16-year highs and investors are slowly shying away from risk as tensions in the Middle East rise. Amazon’s share price has dropped in recent days after a failed attempt to rebound earlier this month. The Magnificent Seven are all facing increased bearish pressure as they have been thought of as the drivers of the 2023 stock market rally, which means many may view them as being overbought. That said, they are often viewed as safer investments by stock traders as they are deemed as “too big to fail” and therefore they may attract value investors in these times of uncertainty. As mentioned above, analyst consensus is for the stock to rise towards $170 over the coming months.

A key driver behind the gold sell-off has been the strength of the U.S. dollar which was given fresh impetus following the Fed’s hawkish ‘higher for longer comments’ at the latest FOMC meeting. Given that gold is typically priced in U.S. dollars, a stronger greenback makes gold relatively more expensive, leading to reduced demand and putting downward pressure on precious metal prices. On the daily candle chart (below) we can see that the spot gold price broke and closed below the summer swing lows. This decisive break of structure has opened the door for a retest of the key support zone created by the early-March swing lows. Whilst there is very little support prior to the early-March swing lows, it is worth noting that the market is starting to show signs of becoming oversold… Prices are trading outside the lower Keltner channel – this means that price is more than 2.5 ATR’s below the 20-day average price. It is also worth noting that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved below 30 and into oversold territory. Gold (spot) Daily Candle Chart If we drill down to the 4hr candle chart, we can see that gold is also oversold on this lower timeframe… Prices are trading below the lower Keltner channel and the RSI indicator is below 30 and showing signs of divergence (making higher swing lows while gold is continuing to make lower swing lows). Given gold’s bearish market structure but short-term oversold signals, we would expect to see some form of pullback which may create an opportunity to short gold at more favourable levels of risk-to-reward. On this week’s economic calendar, we have S&P Global/Cips services PMI data for the U.S. and a host of other G7 nations on Wednesday and we have US employment data on Friday. These economic events have the potential to increase the volatility of gold.

The pattern employs a three-step approach to validate the breakout signal. It relies on a fundamental tenet of price action trading: when resistance is effectively breached, it tends to transition into a supportive platform for the development of uptrends, while conversely, when a support level is convincingly broken, it typically transforms into resistance within markets trending lower. Let’s run through the three steps in detail: : The crucial first step in trading the Break & Retest pattern is to identify significant support and resistance areas on the price chart. Once these levels are recognised, traders should anticipate the pattern's development. Utilising price alerts can prove highly beneficial in this process, as they notify traders when the market is breaking out from these key levels. Additionally, setting alerts for the market's retest of the broken support or resistance level is equally valuable. : Central to entering this pattern is the reversal formation observed during the retest of the broken support or resistance zone. An entry order may be strategically placed just above the high of the reversal candle (see bullish scenario) or below the low of the reversal candle (see bearish scenario). : For risk management, positioning a stop loss is imperative. In a bullish scenario, a stop can be placed at a level below both the low of the reversal pattern and below the broken resistance level. : Traders have the choice of setting a price target relative to market structure (the next key level or support or resistance) or a price target relative to risk. A price target twice the size of your risk is reasonable if you’re trading in-line with the dominant trend. Breakouts from key levels tend to be fast and volatile, making for a high-stress trading environment. The Break & Retest pattern is so useful because it really helps to take the stress out of trading breakouts. It provides traders with a structured approach for confirming the authenticity of breakout signals while simultaneously reducing the associated risks of false breakouts. It's important to acknowledge that not all breakouts will result in a pullback and retest of the breakout zone. However, over a large data set, traders who are patient enough to sit on their hands and wait for the first pullback will be less likely to be caught out by fakeouts and better positioned to manage their risk. It’s an old trading cliché, but when it comes to trading the Break & Retest pattern, the trend really is your friend. This is because the Break & Retest pattern fundamentally functions as a pullback pattern, and pullbacks tend to exhibit greater success within well-established trends. The thrust of the breakout move should be steeper and have more momentum and volume than the pullback phase. A pullback that is just as steep as the breakout phase would be indicative of a failed breakout. Optimal Break & Retest setups exhibit a resumption of breakout momentum shortly after the retest.. We do not want to see the market linger near the broken resistance (or support) level. Implement proper risk management techniques, such as position sizing, checking the economic calendar, and diversifying your trading portfolio. This helps protect against unexpected market movements and potential losses. Don't rely solely on the Break & Retest pattern for trading decisions. Supplement your analysis with fundamental factors and market sentiment to gain a comprehensive view of the market.

{"source": "Capital.com", "title": "Trading the Complex Pullback", "title_link": "https://capital.com/trading-the-complex-pullback", "published_date": "11:20, 4 October 2023", "author": " Capital.com News", "Description": "By We’ll teach you: A complex pullback pattern arises in the context of a trending market. It unfolds as follows: The market experiences a strong trend move, characterised by a sustained price movement in one direction. Following the initial trend move, the market takes a breather and enters a consolidation phase. During this phase, prices may move counter to the prevailing trend for a brief period. After the consolidation phase, the market attempts to resume the initial trend. However, this first attempt fails to gain momentum, resulting in a pullback. What distinguishes the complex pullback is the presence of multiple countertrend legs within the pullback structure. These countertrend legs can create a more intricate and challenging pattern to navigate. The correct use of Keltner Channels can make life much easier when it comes to trading complex pullbacks. Keltner Channels take a multiple of the Average True Range (ATR) and wrap it around a moving average. We tend to use a 2.5 ATR wrapped around a 20-day exponential moving average (20EMA). The upper channel is 2.5 ATR’s above the 20EMA and the lower is 2.5 ATR’s below the 20EMA. Price must be moving with strong levels of relative momentum in order to hit or surpass the upper or lower Keltner Channel. Hence Keltner Channels can help to define the initial trend move required to setup the complex pullback. The 20EMA is also a handy reference point for gauging when a complex pullback may be ready to turn. If we overlay some Keltner Channels on our charts (below), we can see that in the bullish scenario, prices push into the upper Keltner Channel before pulling back to the 20EMA, and we see the opposite occur in the bearish scenario. Using Keltner Channels when trading complex pullbacks can help to remove some of the subjectivity involved which may ultimately help you to become a more consistent trader. Enter on a fakeout at the pullback extremes. In Part 1 of our Power Patterns series we introduced a pattern called the fakeout. This pattern occurs when the market breaks below support only to close back above it (or above resistance only to close back below it). Using the fakeout pattern to enter complex pullbacks is advanced and will take time and practice to perfect, but it is well worth the effort as it can offer favourable levels of risk-to-reward. Stops can be placed below the fakeout lows (bullish scenario) or above the fakeout highs (bearish scenario). An alternative stop placement technique is to use a multiple of ATR. Initial targets are the swing highs created prior to the complex pullback (bullish scenario) – this is a great area to take partial profits and cover stops. Traders can then use the Keltner Channels for secondary profit targets (see examples below). Alongside stop placement, it is essential that traders implement proper risk management techniques, such as position sizing, checking the economic calendar, and diversifying your trading portfolio. Don't rely solely on the complex pullback pattern for your trading decisions. Supplement your analysis with fundamental factors and market sentiment to gain a comprehensive view of the market.

Having hit highs of $130 in June, the shares have undergone a prolonged period of consolidation which has seen the shares pull back to a confluent area of support. The shares have completed a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement from the key October lows, and a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement from the May lows. This Fibonacci cluster coincided with a key level of horizontal support created by the March swing highs. Last month, the shares briefly broke below horizontal support, but rallied from the 200-Day Moving Average. The rally was strong enough to reclaim support and break above the descending retracement line. With short-term momentum now realigned with the bigger picture trend, probabilities should favour upside continuation. Those looking to take this trade could place stops back below the cluster of horizontal support levels. For targets, traders should use the swing resistance levels created during AMD’s prolonged period of consolidation – ultimate targets would be a retest of trend highs.

Food sales increased by over 11%, driven by price changes, while Clothing & Home sales grew by more than 6%, primarily due to in-store growth. Despite economic uncertainties, the company expects significant improvements in full-year profit growth and half-year results compared to previous expectations of modest revenue growth. Marks & Spencer’s share price has been locked in a powerful uptrend since the turn of the year. Recent price action has seen the shares break out from a wedge pattern and retest trend highs. We are now seeing prices consolidate at trend highs within a series of small candles. This form of high and tight consolidation signals a reluctance to pull back, which suggests that the shares are being accumulated ahead of a potential move higher. Next's half-year sales grew 5.4% to £2.6 billion, benefiting from higher wages and warm weather in late spring and early summer. Pre-tax profit rose 4.8% to £419.8 million, driven by increased sales and higher full-price sales of their own-brand products. They improved free cash flow to £438.1 million and reduced net debt to £1.7 billion. Full-year profit guidance was raised to £875 million. Next completed £167 million in share buybacks, plans to spend £52 million more, and announced an interim dividend of 66p per share. Next’s uptrend is decidedly less pretty than Marks & Spencer’s, but we have seen prices carve out a rising series of higher swing lows. This has created a steepening trendline fan which suggests underlying price momentum is increasing. Recent price action has seen the shares pull back to a key area of trend support created by the broken summer swing highs. Should Next’s uptrend continue, we would expect these broken summer swing highs to provide support moving forward. It’s worth noting that despite the robust high street presence of both Marks & Spencer and Next, rising inflation may impact consumer spending. Cost-saving measures from both businesses may not fully offset increased costs, potentially leading to higher prices. Marks & Spencer are set to release half year earnings on 8th November 2023. Next are set to release Q3 earnings on 1st November 2023.

The action begins on Wednesday with Fed Chair Jay Powell widely anticipated to keep rates unchanged at 5.5%. On Thursday, attention shifts to Andrew Bailey's announcement at the BoE, where some uncertainty looms… There is a possibility of a 25 basis point rate hike (Reuters), but the BoE's decision will be influenced heavily by the UK inflation figures released the day before the Monetary Policy Committee convenes. These figures are expected to show a slight uptick in the headline rate compared to the previous month. On the price chart, cable is coiled and consolidating near recent lows. The daily candle chart (below) shows that cable has been trending lower for the last two months and this week’s price action has seen the pair tread water in anticipation of the key data releases. Yesterday’s daily range was the smallest we’ve seen in over seven sessions and this narrow consolidation has a tendency to precede explosive directional price action. If we drop down a timeframe and zoom into cables 4hr candle chart, we can see that this week’s consolidation has formed a bearish descending triangle pattern. This pattern signals trend continuation and traders will be watching the pattern lows as a trigger for potential short positions.

In August, the US added 187,000 new jobs, but the unemployment rate also rose to 3.8%. This increase was partly due to a higher participation rate, reaching its highest level since the economy reopened after the COVID-19 pandemic. The June and July payroll reports were revised downward. Wage growth slowed to 4.3%, which aligns with the Federal Reserve's preferences. However, inflation is showing signs of picking up due to higher fuel prices, potentially leading to wage inflation. Expectations for tomorrow’s NFP report are 170,000 new jobs added and a slight decrease in the unemployment rate to 3.7%. Average hourly earnings will be closely monitored for signs of wage stickiness. A robust jobs report could bolster the argument for a year-end rate hike, especially if core prices and wages remain resilient. In such a scenario, we can expect the U.S. dollar to gain strength while U.S. stocks may face downward pressure. King dollar reigns supreme right now with the U.S dollar basket index surging to two-year highs following the Fed’s recent hawkish comments. We have a strong and sustainable uptrend on DXY’s daily candle chart (below) with the 20-day exponential moving average (20EMA) tracking along with the ascending trendline. And whilst a deeper pullback is likely to ensue at some point, established trends of this nature tend to take much longer than anticipated to reverse. U.S. stocks have undergone a deep retracement in recent months with all three major U.S. stock indices pulling back more than 7% from their summer highs. The Dow 30 index looks the weakest of the bunch from a technical perspective. Prices have sold off with such strength in recent weeks that the Dow has broke and closed below the lower Keltner Channel for the first time in over a year. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have completed an ABCD harmonic retracement pattern. Interestingly for the Nasdaq this harmonic completion coincides with a test of a key support level (see chart below). When viewed in the context of Nasdaq's long-term uptrend, this confluence of support levels could be of interest to buyers.

JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup, BlackRock, and Wells Fargo will kick off the financial sector’s reporting season this Friday, 13 October, before the opening bell. They’ll be followed by Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs on 17 October, and Morgan Stanley on 18 October. In the second quarter, we saw US banks benefitting from higher interest rates – but the outlook became slightly clouded on the back of slower consumer spending and loan growth. The investment banking sector performed relatively well as higher rates and economic uncertainty drove volatility. The banking sector continues to face several headwinds, which include higher costs and increased regulatory requirements, as well as the impact of higher bond yields on the value of assets on their balance sheet. It’s also important to consider the challenges consumers will face in the coming years, which has led banks to increase their loan-loss provisions, which will be reflected in their statements. It also evidences that they are bracing for tougher times ahead. Another strong jobs report last week increased the odds that the Federal Reserve may hike rates one more time, putting further constraints on net interest income growth – and it's also raising the risk of a recession. It’s safe to say the health of balance sheets and forecasts about the economy will be key in the upcoming earnings. Data compiled by Bloomberg suggests JP Morgan (JPM) is set to show the strongest growth among US investment banks. Net interest income could grow more than 25%, which would offset the likely drop in trading revenues and fees. Markets are likely to focus on whether the bank can beat its full-year net interest income (NII) guidance. Earnings per share (EPS) are forecasted to come in at 3.89 – a drop from 4.98 in the previous quarter, and a 25% rise from the same quarter last year. Loan-loss provisions are forecasted to have dropped 16% in the third quarter. JPM is one of the only large US banks to still be trading above its 2023 opening price, as it led the industry’s efforts to stabilise the market following the banking crisis in March. This has allowed it to grow its loan book and capitalise on higher interest rates. The bias is likely to remain to the upside if earnings live up to their expectations. Given the bank's recent restructuring, costs and expenses remain under scrutiny. It’s likely that an increase in its operational costs will outweigh revenue growth and weigh on profitability. As per data from Reuters, EPS is forecasted to come in at 1.18, down from 1.37 in the previous quarter, and a 23% drop from the same quarter last year. Loan-loss provisions are expected to have risen 9% in the third quarter. The stock is currently trading 7% below its 2023 opening price, but is starting to pick up some momentum ahead of the earnings report. The upward trajectory could continue if we see a positive earnings surprise. Given the recent inflationary environment, operating expenses picked up in 2023, and the third quarter is forecasted to show another rise in costs, as per data from Reuters. That said, the bank has been focused more on expanding and upgrading its technology, which could create a bias for a higher share price in the future. For now, EPS is forecasted to come in at 0.80, down from 0.88 in the previous quarter, and a 1% drop from the same quarter last year. Loan-loss provisions are forecasted to have risen 13% in the third quarter. BAC is trading 17% below its 2023 opening price, having been heavily punished in the banking crisis earlier this year. This makes the stock attractive to potential investors ahead of the earnings release. Reuters forecasts show an expected rise in revenues, led mostly by its wealth management division. This, alongside a drop in operating expenses, is expected to show EBIT higher than in Q2. Goldman’s earnings are known to be quite volatile from one quarter to another. EPS in Q3 is forecasted at 5.34, up from 3.08 in Q2, but down 36% from the same quarter last year. Loan-loss provisions are expected to have dropped 6% in Q3 – but they grew 260% from Q1 to Q2. The spike in bond yields has weighed on its stock, and data from Reuters suggests a drop in revenues from the previous quarter. That said, a drop in operating expenses is expected to offset this, with EPS estimated at 1.28 (up from 1.24 in the previous quarter), but a 15% drop from the same period last year. Loan-loss provisions are expected to have dropped 3.6% from the previous quarter.

Fed Chair Jay Powell, indicated a commitment to keeping interest rates higher for a longer period, suggesting a more hawkish stance. In contrast, Governor Kazuo Ueda of the BoJ emphasised the need for patience in maintaining an ultra-loose monetary policy until stable and sustainable inflation is realised. The BoJ kept short-term interest rates at minus 0.1% while the market now expects the Fed’s current interest rate range of 5.25% - 5.5% to be maintained for longer than previously expected (CME Fed Watch Tool). A glance at USD/JPY’s 4hr candle chart (below) shows that prices have recently regained enough bullish momentum to push up into the upper Keltner Channel. To see where this current uptrend may terminate we can go up a timeframe to the daily candle (below). Looking left on the daily candle chart shows that the market is approaching the spike highs which formed in October last year. A zone of resistance can be drawn from the highest close to the highest high – this is an area in which we could expect USD/JPY’s powerful uptrend to take a pause. In this week's economic calendar, two notable events stand out for the U.S. economy. First, on Wednesday, we have the release of the monthly durable goods orders data. This report has the potential to impact the U.S. dollar's volatility as it provides insights into the health of the manufacturing sector and consumer spending patterns. Additionally, on Thursday, we will see the release of the final Q2 GDP figures for the U.S. economy. These figures are closely watched by investors and economists alike, and any unexpected revisions or significant changes can lead to increased volatility in the U.S. dollar.

Dojo's production began in July, and Tesla plans to invest over $1 billion in it by next year. The supercomputer could create new markets beyond vehicle sales, particularly in applications where real-time visual decision-making is crucial. Morgan Stanley upgraded Tesla to \"overweight\" and raised their 12-18 month target by 60% to $400, projecting a market cap of around $1.39 trillion, compared to the current value of about $789 billion. Monday’s price gap has given the stock a boost of bullish momentum, aligning with the ascending channel that has been in place since mid-August. On the 4hr candle chart (below), we can see that price action following Monday’s gap has seen the shares consolidate within a compact triangular bull flag pattern. This pattern of bullish consolidation suggests the likelihood of a short-term trend continuation, hinting at the possibility of prices moving higher and eventually closing the significant negative gap that emerged on July 20th following the release of Tesla's Q2 results. Let's take a look at the bigger picture by switching to the daily candle chart (below). Here, we can see that the stock has been on an upward trend since the start of the year, with prices consistently staying above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. This longer-term view supports our positive short-term outlook on the 4-hour candle chart. Traders looking to take a long position in Tesla could enter on a breakout from the small bull flag which has formed on the 4hr candle chart. A logical area for stop placement is below the bull flag low, while a reasonable area for initial profit targets could be the top of the July 20th gap. Tesla is a volatile stock and traders should check the economic calendar prior to taking a position.

{"source": "Capital.com", "title": "How to Trade The Triple Top", "title_link": "https://capital.com/how-to-trade-the-triple-top", "published_date": "14:13, 27 September 2023", "author": " Capital.com News", "Description": "By Welcome to Part 5 of our 7-part Power Patterns series. In this series, we'll be equipping you with the skills to trade some of the most indicative price patterns which occur on any timeframe in every market. This week’s pattern, the Triple Top is a reversal signal that applies just as well to lower timeframe day trading as it does to higher timeframe swing trading. We’ll teach you: Here’s the key characteristics that make for a perfect Triple Top reversal pattern: The Triple Top reversal pattern usually forms after an extended period of rising prices, indicating that buyers have been in control for some time. As the name suggests, this pattern consists of three peaks or highs that are roughly equal in height. These peaks are separated by minor retracements or consolidations but should occur at approximately the same price level. The line connecting the lows between the three peaks is called the \"neckline.\" The neckline can act as a level to watch for confirmation of the pattern. However, when trading this pattern on lower timeframes you may not have the luxury of a picture perfect upward sloping neckline. Using negative divergence on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator can be a valuable confirmation tool for a Triple Top reversal pattern because it provides additional evidence of weakening bullish momentum. Negative divergence on the RSI occurs when the RSI indicator forms lower highs while the price forms equal or higher highs. In other words, there is a disconnect between price action and RSI momentum. This divergence suggests that the strength of the bullish momentum is waning, even though the price continues to make new highs. Using the additional confirmation of RSI divergence strengthens the case for a potential trend reversal, as it suggests that not only is the price encountering resistance but also that the underlying momentum is weakening. At this point it's worth noting that whilst the Triple Top has the alliteration, the Triple Bottom is just as effective. Eagle-eyed readers may have already noticed that the EUR/USD chart we’ve used also contains a Triple Bottom reversal pattern at the bottom left of the chart. RSI divergence can also be applied to the Triple Bottom. There are two approaches to trading the Triple Top reversal pattern, standard and aggressive, depending on your trading experience and willingness to anticipate the pattern forming: : Being patient enough to wait for a break and close below the neckline is crucial because it will ensure that you’re not selling into a bullish ascending triangle pattern. Traders can then choose to enter on a break below the low of the candle which closed below the neckline. : A stop loss should be placed at a level that is both above the neckline and above the candle which broke and closed below the neckline. : A simple and effective target for the Triple Top reversal pattern is to set a target which is twice the distance of your stop (2R). : This method requires anticipating the third peak forming. Once two peaks have formed, traders can enter on the first down candle which forms after the third test of resistance. : A key benefit of the aggressive approach is the ability to place your stop loss above the three peak highs whilst still achieving favourable levels of risk-to-reward. : The 2R target method is still effective for this approach. Traders should be wary of how the market responds to the neckline. Traders may also want to take partial profits as the trade progresses. The Triple Top is a counter-trend pattern so it is essential that traders implement proper risk management techniques, such as position sizing, checking the economic calendar, and diversifying your trading portfolio. Don't rely solely on the Triple Top pattern for trading decisions. Supplement your analysis with fundamental factors and market sentiment to gain a comprehensive view of the market.

Markets were anticipating a yearly change of 3.6%, but the actual figure has come in higher at 3.7%. Core CPI, which had been the main cause of concern at the end of last year and had managed to rise less than expected in July, has followed headline inflation higher, rising 0.3% in August, as analysts estimated the figure to remain unchanged at 0.2%. Energy prices have picked up once again, led higher mostly by oil, which will be rebalancing the base effects after the continued drop in the latter part of 2022. This is the reason why headline inflation is rising faster than core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices. But the rise in core inflation renews concerns about a resurgence in domestic price pressures, which will keep the Federal Reserve on a hawkish monetary policy track. Prior to the data release, market-implied pricing was suggesting a 93% chance of no rate hike at the Fed’s meeting next week, on Wednesday, September 20. As it currently stands, these probabilities have shifted to a 95% chance of no hike, despite the data coming in higher than expected. So, it seems like it’s going to take a lot more than just one data point to convince markets that the Fed needs to hike again in September. In fact, most of the focus is on what will happen at the meeting in November, with markets now split on whether another hike will be needed then. The initial reaction in the market has been subdued. The dollar hasn’t managed to find enough support to push higher towards the 105 level as clearly evidenced by market-implied probabilities, traders still believe the Fed will keep rates on hold next week. This means the positive surprise in the CPI data has failed to lift the dollar higher. The stock market continues to try and find its footing but hasn’t evidenced a significant selloff after the release. It's likely that markets will remain sensitive to any developments over the coming days that could impact the rate decision next week.

Despite maintaining its benchmark interest rate at a 22-year high during its recent two-day meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee signalled its support for additional monetary tightening within the year and fewer rate cuts in the following year. The committee unanimously decided to keep the federal funds rate steady, ranging from 5.25% to 5.5%, aligning with the U.S. central bank's cautious approach in the latter stages of its fight against inflation. In a statement, the committee emphasised its continued vigilance regarding inflation risks, highlighting that economic activity had been steadily expanding and job gains, while somewhat slower, remained robust. These developments come in the wake of Tuesday's disappointing European inflation data, which reinforces the European Central Bank's stance of concluding its rate hike cycle that was announced last week. On the back of yesterday’s newsflow, EUR/USD moved lower to retest a significant support level created by the end-May swing lows (see daily candle chart below). This support level represents six-month lows, and whilst the dominant trend in this market is firmly bearish, we may see buyers step in at such a key support level. If we drop down a timeframe and zoom into EUR/USD’s 4hr candle chart (below), we can see that price is already responding to support. Having broken below support during Asian trading hours, price has been driven back above the support level – forming a small bullish fakeout pattern. Support and resistance levels are never guaranteed to hold and should be complemented by price action confirmation and further analysis. This morning’s rate decision from the Bank of England has the potential to cause outsized volatility in European currency pairs. Traders should factor this risk into their position sizing, stop placement and trade plan.

Having spent the first half of the week coiled and consolidating, the FTSE burst into life on Thursday – breaking and closing above multiple levels of resistance and posting its biggest day of gains since March. Thursday’s rally was fuelled by the European Central Bank (ECB) confirming the end of its rate hike cycle. This fed into a surge in commodity prices which propelled the FTSE 100 higher as the index is heavily weighted towards energy and mining stocks. The rally brought the FTSE back to the levels it had reached during the summer swing highs—an area we had previously pointed out as a zone of resistance (refer to the chart below). On Friday, market participants reacted to this resistance by closing out positions in anticipation of the weekend. It's important to highlight that even though the FTSE has started the new week with a somewhat subdued performance, the prevailing short-term momentum remains bullish, thanks to the gains seen on Thursday. Support and resistance levels should be used as a guide and are not guaranteed to hold. We have a busy week ahead on the economic calendar, key events include; Eurozone inflation data on Tuesday morning, UK inflation on Wednesday morning, the Federal Open Market Committee interest rate announcement on Wednesday, and the Bank of England rate decision on Thursday.

The company's shares have experienced a remarkable uptrend, surging by an impressive 227% year-to-date. However, we are starting to see some subtle signs that Nvidia’s share price might be nearing a turning point. Before we break down why Nvidia’s powerful uptrend might be coming to an end, let’s take a look at the year-to-date view on the daily candle chart: We can see that Nvidia’s shares have been running relentlessly higher since the turn of the year with prices comfortably above the 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages. Whilst calling the end of established trends like this tends to be foolish, we are seeing some signs that Nvidia’s share price may be due for a deeper retracement. Let’s zoom in and take a closer look at Nvidia’s recent price action: On this zoomed view we can see that during the last two weeks, Nvidia’s share price has struggled to break and hold above resistance at $480.85. We’ve seen multiple dark cloud cover patterns print at resistance – this pattern is created when the market gaps higher at the open only to end the session back within the previous days range. And this week, we have seen the shares attempt to hold above resistance only for the market to close lower during yesterday’s session. It is also worth noting that whilst prices have continued to carve out a series of higher swing highs and higher swing lows, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been trending lower. This negative divergence on the RSI, combined with the recurring failures at resistance indicate that selling pressure is starting to build and we could start to see some profit taking. Counter-trend trades pose the risk of the established trend continuing, so traders should always use prudent risk management. For stop placement, traders could use the recent highs or a multiple of Nvidia’s average true range (ATR). On the calendar, we have Nvidia’s appearance at the Citi Global Technology Conference today (7th September) and Nvidia’s appearance at the Bank of America Global AI Conference on 11th September. These events have the potential to increase the volatility of Nvidia’s share price. It is also worth noting that Nvidia’s share price will be sensitive to global macro-economic data and events.

A key characteristic of this downtrend has been repeated moves down into the lower Keltner channel followed by pullbacks to the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA). Recent price action has seen cable break to new trend lows last week, pressing down into the lower Keltner channel. True to form, this has been followed by a steady pullback towards the 20-day EMA – an area that coincides with a key area of horizontal resistance. If we zoom in and analyse this week’s price action in more detail (see chart below), we can see that cable formed a bearish pin-bar candle at resistance during yesterday’s session. This price action signals that the market may be starting to succumb to the dominant downtrend. Traders looking to trade this pullback could place stops either above yesterday’s pin-bar high, or above the upper Keltner channel on the 4hr chart. For targets, a retest of last week’s lows looks to be logical initial target while secondary targets could be as low as the May swing lows. In terms of newsflow, this morning’s UK economic data revealed that UK wages in the three months to July grew at their fastest pace on record, with average pay, excluding bonuses, rising by 7.8%, the highest rate since 2001. Total pay, including one-off payments to NHS workers and civil servants, increased by 8.5%, outpacing inflation. This raises concerns for the Bank of England about inflation despite a weaker job market. Tomorrow’s UK GDP data and U.S. inflation data have the potential to cause outsized volalitty for this currency pair.

Nvidia is the powerhouse behind semiconductors that power AI programmes like ChatGPT, and saw an uptick in and revenues in the latest quarter. Will the chip behemoth maintain the momentum and what’s amid the AI-driven exuberance? Here we take a look at the latest news and future predictions from analysts. Nvidia Corporation, founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, is a multinational technology company recognized globally for its pioneering work in graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI). From the very beginning, Nvidia has been a trailblazer in visual computing, producing the first Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), the GeForce, in 1999. This key development in computational technology revolutionised the way we interact with graphics and images, from gaming and entertainment to professional design and visualisation. Over the years, Nvidia product line has grown to include not just GPUs for gaming and professional use, but also system-on-a-chip units (SoCs) for mobile computing and automotive markets. The company's latest venture, data centre GPUs, are designed to accelerate AI, data science, and high-performance computing (HPC). Today, Nvidia stands as a leading force in the technology sector, not just for its hardware but also for its software and services. Their full range of products now extends into AI computing platforms, deep learning software, autonomous driving technology, and much more. In essence, Nvidia innovations continue to redefine the boundaries of what's possible in visual and computational technology. The robust growth of , which has soared by 188% year-to-date (as of 30 May), is largely attributed to the burgeoning interest in generative AI, sparked by the remarkable success of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The stock reached the record high of $419 on 30 May, making it the first semiconductor company to hit the $1tn market cap mark. Nvidia recently the development of a new AI supercomputer platform DGX GH200, strengthening its position at the forefront of the AI revolution. This announcement came shortly after NVIDIA revealed a promising second-quarter revenue outlook of $11bn. Meanwhile, Nvidia revealed revenue of $7.19bn, 19% up from the previous quarter. The Record Data Center revenue amounted to $4.28bn in the quarter. The firm’s CEO Jensen Huang commented: The tech giant returned $99m to shareholders in cash , and will pay the next quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share on 30 June to all shareholders of record on 8 June. The primary driver of this growth is the rising demand for Nvidia’s chips, specifically designed for AI applications. This escalating demand signifies the potential for Nvidia’s revenue to continue its upward trajectory, and hence the developments in the AI sector will be key in determining the stock projections. The stock was rated as a “Moderate Buy” according to , based on 37 analyst ratings the website compiled as of 30 May. The average Nvidia stock forecast for the next 12 months as of 30 May was $379.73, ranging from the high of $500 to the low of $133. Following the first-quarter results, 22 analysts boosted their Nvidia stock price targets, or upgraded their ratings, for the stock. This included Nvidia stock predictions from Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Barclays. None of the analysts have provided a Nvidia stock 5-year forecast due to the high number of uncertainties. Yet it’s likely that the revolution in the AI sector and its projected growth will be the key factor shaping the chip giant’s future. As noted by Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, the AI demand is so high that Nvidia is having to strain to keep up. He added: Yet according to Sophie Lundt-Yates, the exuberance experienced by the market players about the AI boom is not without risks, as it may distort Nvidia’s long-term forecasts. She explained: Remember that analyst views and predictions can be wrong, and it’s impossible to accurately estimate the value of Nvidia stock in 5 years as there are many uncertainties at play. Always conduct your own due diligence before trading, looking at the latest and , and never trade more money than you can afford to lose.

{"source": "Capital.com", "title": "How to Trade the Fakeout", "title_link": "https://capital.com/how-to-trade-the-fakeout", "published_date": "11:59, 30 August 2023", "author": " Capital.com News", "Description": "By We’ll teach you: The term ‘fakeout’ is trading slang for false breakout, the fakeout pattern occurs when a breakout fails at a key horizontal level in the market. We’ll be focusing on the single bar fakeout which means that the failure of the breakout must occur within the same candle or bar. The pattern can be applied to a bullish or bearish scenario: This occurs when the market breaks below a key level of support only for the breakout to fail and for the market to close back above the support level. In trading, a picture really is worth a thousand words so check out the chart below. And if you want to take your learning of this pattern to the next level then please try and hunt down as many examples of this pattern as possible. NOTE: The horizontal support level and the fakeout candle must be on the same timeframe - the chart below is the daily candle chart but you can trade this pattern on any timeframe. This occurs when the market breaks above a key level of resistance only for the breakout to fail and for the market to close back below the resistance level. Here’s an example on the hourly candle chart: Here’s an example of bullish and bearish setups forming when a market starts to trade in a sideways range: The fake-out pattern can be so powerful because it can exploit herd behaviour in a deliciously effective way. When a market starts to breakout, FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) may herd traders into the market. This fear could drive them to enter positions hastily, often without waiting for confirmation. Then, as the breakout starts to fail, the herd may head for the exit and panic sets in as trapped traders cover losses. Identifying and anticipating the fakeout: First and foremost, traders need to identify key support and resistance levels. It’s worth setting a price alert at these key levels so you’re alerted to when the market tests them. When the level is tested, set a time alert for when the candle closes. Through the disciplined use of price and time alerts, you’re unlikely to miss a fakeout again! Entry Points: For bullish fake-out patterns, a trader may enter on a break above the fake-out candle high. For bearish fake-out patterns they would enter on a break of the fake-out candle low (see chart below for example). Stop-Loss Placement: Traditional stop placement for the pattern is above or below the tail of the fakeout candle depending on if you’re going long or short. An alternative stop placement method is using a volatility-adjusted stop such as placing your stop a multiple of the Average True Range (ATR) away from the current price. Whichever method you use, be consistent. Price Targets: A limit order to take profit at the next level of support or resistance can be a robust approach to profit taking for this pattern. Alternative methods include taking a set multiple of risk or trailing stops to lock in profits. Bullish scenario: Bearish scenario: Support and resistance levels should be clear and obvious, a breakout above or below multi-day or multi-week highs or lows are likely to gain the most attention, meaning a higher number of trapped traders should the breakout fail. The tail of the breakout candle represents the prices which the market was pushed to prior to the breakout failing. Longer tails typically indicate a higher number of trapped traders. Traders should be wary when price starts to consolidate just below a key area of resistance or just above a key area of support. This ‘base’ raises the probability of a breakout holding. Risk Management: Implement proper risk management techniques, such as position sizing, setting stop-loss orders, and diversifying your trading portfolio. This helps protect against unexpected market movements and potential losses. Additional Analysis: Don't rely solely on the fakeout pattern for trading decisions. Supplement your analysis with fundamental factors and market sentiment to gain a comprehensive view of the market.

The bearish channel breakdown was a scenario we mapped out in last week’s gold game plan. A key catalyst behind the move lower in gold was a resurgent U.S. dollar with the dollar index (DXY) hitting highs not seen since March. It’s also worth noting that the gold market continues to respect the long-term descending trendline which connects the swing highs formed in May and July (see daily candle chart below). On average, the gold market moves up or down by $44 in a week and by $15 dollars in a day. This is taken from gold’s average true range (ATR) and can be used to calibrate your stop loss and profit target expectations. In terms of upcoming economic news that could impact the price of gold, on Wednesday we have U.S. inflation data for September. This data will impact the market’s interest rate projections which may cause outsized volatility in U.S. dollar currency pairs and gold.

{"source": "Capital.com", "title": "Exploring the Bearish Engulfing Pattern", "title_link": "https://capital.com/exploring-the-bearish-engulfing-pattern", "published_date": "10:58, 13 September 2023", "author": " Capital.com News", "Description": "By We'll teach you:asx The bearish engulfing pattern is formed when the market trades higher than the previous day’s high, only for prices to reverse and close below the previous day's low. Here’s the pattern deconstructed into its key elements: The engulfing candle must establish a higher high than the preceding day's candle, suggesting bullish optimism initially. The engulfing candle should form a lower low compared to the previous day, indicating a shift in market sentiment. Importantly, the engulfing candle must close below the prior day's low, sealing the bearish sentiment. This pattern's underlying psychology is robust. It resonates with day traders and active market participants who use the prior day's high and low as reference points for trading decisions. When a bearish engulfing pattern forms, it reveals not only the market's inability to sustain prices above the prior day's highs but also its capacity to erase those gains completely. This leaves bullish traders who entered on the break above the prior day's highs in a precarious position. At its core, the bearish engulfing pattern, though composed of only two candles, might signal that the bears have taken control of the market, offering invaluable insight to traders looking to manage long-term positions or take short-term trades. There’s a common misconception surrounding the bearish engulfing pattern. It is often regarded as a counter trend pattern which signals the end of uptrends. However, we believe the pattern is at its most effective when it occurs following pullbacks in long-term downtrends. Every downtrend goes through prolonged pullbacks and periods of sideways consolidation. During these periods a resistance level is often formed. Here’s an example of the bearish engulfing pattern working well in a long-term downtrend: Trading the bearish engulfing pattern can be a rewarding endeavour, but it also presents traders with a crucial decision: how to maximise precision in entry and stop-loss placement while achieving favourable risk-reward ratios. In this section, we will explore a hybrid approach that attempts to combine the best of both worlds and allow traders to benefit from the pattern's precision while optimising their risk-reward potential. To initiate a trade using the bearish engulfing pattern, enter the market on a break below the low of the engulfing candle. This entry point capitalises on the bearish momentum confirmed by the pattern. Instead of placing your stop-loss order directly above the high of the engulfing candle, which can sometimes be a considerable distance away and increase risk, opt for a more strategic approach. Consider placing your stop-loss order just above the resistance level that the engulfing candle has rejected. This not only helps protect your trade but can also maximise the risk-reward potential by reducing the distance between your entry and stop-loss levels. Determine your initial profit targets based on the nearest key support zones visible on your chart. However, to further optimise your trade, consider the following: Implement proper risk management techniques, such as position sizing, checking the economic calendar, and diversifying your trading portfolio. This helps protect against unexpected market movements and potential losses. Don't rely solely on the bearish engulfing pattern for trading decisions. Supplement your analysis with fundamental factors and sentiment indicators to gain a comprehensive view of the market.

At the June FOMC meeting the Fed decided to pause rate hikes after 10 consecutive rate hikes, leaving the rate unchanged at 5% - 5.25%, the highest level since 2007. The market-implied pricing shows a probability of 96% that the Federal Reserve hikes 25bps again at their meeting on Wednesday. The remaining 4% is currently assigned to the Fed choosing to keep rates on hold again. It is interesting how these probabilities have changed – or rather how they haven’t changed – in the past 10 days. On July 12 the consumer price index (CPI) for June was released, showing a whole percentage point drop from 4% to 3%, the lowest level since April 2021. This is also the upper band of the Fed’s inflation target, which suggests that price pressures are finally getting under control. Core inflation also dropped, albeit a little more stubbornly, to its lowest level since December 2021. After the release, market expectations about a 25bps hike at the upcoming meeting remained unchanged and eventually rose in the days after. It's becoming increasingly apparent that markets believe the Fed can achieve a “soft landing” scenario, where inflation is reduced without hindering growth in the process. Given the way risk appetite has been booming recently, with stocks leading the way higher, it seems not even another rate hike can ruin the good mood amongst investors. In all fairness, the economy has shown incredible resilience so far, which is helping the Fed's hawkish stance to combat inflation. It seems like everyone is on the same page for this upcoming meeting so 25bps is the base case. This would allow equities to continue edging higher whilst the US Dollar struggles to find support to reverse the recent losses. It seems highly unlikely at this point that we see any other scenario. If the Fed decided not to hike again at this meeting, it would likely cause some sort of mild panic in markets which would read between the lines that the economy is not as stable and resilient as thought, potentially causing equities to turn lower and the US dollar to pick up some safe-haven demand. On the contrary, a 50bps hike, which seems like the least likely possibility right now, could see a mixed reaction from markets. It would take them completely by surprise, but equities would probably see a negative immediate reaction but could then turn higher if it is thought that the higher rate hikes mean the Fed believes the economy is resilient enough to sustain tighter financial conditions. For the US Dollar, a hawkish Fed has been a tailwind in the past year, so a bigger rate hike could offer some bullish momentum, although it would likely not last that long. The key to this meeting will be trying to obtain any further information about the rate curve and what to expect at future meetings. So far, the Fed sees peak rates around 5.6% which suggests a maximum of one, possibly two, more rate hikes. Powell will probably address the drop in consumer prices at his press conference so traders will likely be on the lookout for any signs that the rate hike priced in for this week may possibly be the last one of this cycle. Markets are expecting the European Central Bank (ECB) to deliver another 25bps at their meeting on Thursday, with an implied probability of 98.5%, with the potential for another similar hike before the end of the year. In Europe, inflation remains more elevated than in the US, with the June consumer price reading (CPI) for the Eurozone coming in at 5.5%, its lowest level since February last year. The drop from the highs has been significant, with inflation peaking at 10.6% in November last year, but the recent stubbornness in the disinflationary process has meant the ECB has had to keep to a more hawkish path in recent months. In all fairness, the ECB has been very committed to combating inflation, with Lagarde adopting a strong hawkish stance at her recent press conferences, unlike Governor Bailey from the Bank of England, who is facing an even worse inflationary problem. There is likely to be little surprise regarding the rate hike at this meeting, given 25bps seems pretty much like a done deal but communication is going to be one of the trickiest parts of this upcoming meeting, as it is a very close call on whether another rate hike will be delivered in September. The narrowing of interest rate differentials has boosted the euro against the dollar this year, with the recent drop in the dollar propelling EUR/USD to a 17-month high. So far, the pair has found resistance around the 1.20 mark, which is an important psychological level. It’s normal for the bullish momentum to take a break after such a significant move in the past few weeks. The RSI was at the highest level since December 2020 which was signalling that the market was overextended and therefore looking primed for a pullback, but the path of least resistance remains higher for EUR/USD, as long as the pair remains above 1.10 over the coming weeks. If bullish momentum resumes, 1.1370 will be the next key area of resistance to look out for. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has been one of the most dovish since the start of the pandemic-stimulus era. Inflation in Japan has been much more stubborn, with consumer prices peaking at 4.3% in February this year. The BOJ has been keeping monetary policy ultra-loose for the past few years, stimulating the economy, and keeping borrowing costs low. This has damaged the performance of the Japanese Yen as the currency has been used as a funding currency in carry trades, given its low yield. The central bank has justified its policy approach by arguing that inflationary pressures were due to external factors like rises in oil prices and that they wouldn’t last. But given price pressures have recently rebounded and remained elevated despite falling energy prices, suggesting it is being driven by improving consumer demand, many economists now believe that the bank is going to need to adapt their policy to avoid inflation getting out of hand. Amendments to their yield curve control (YCC) policy are thought to be the most likely policy tweak to happen, but markets have been anticipating this for the past few months, with little action so far. The question is whether anything will change at the upcoming meeting and how markets will react to this. Will they take it as a sign that Japanese inflation is a bigger concern than originally thought or will they see it as a positive sign that the BOJ is finally catching up to the evolving economic situation in Japan? USD/JPY has staged a dramatic drop in the past two weeks, shedding almost 5% in just one week as the US dollar faced heavy losses. The pair has been tracking the yield differential between US bonds and Japanese bonds, and with the Fed looking more likely to pause hiking rates, yields on US bonds have dropped, tightening the differential, and favouring the Yen. But these moves have been driven by the dollar side of the trade, something that could change if the BOJ took policy action. So far USD/JPY has found support along the 100-day SMA (137.130) but the move higher seems like it's already slightly exhausted, suggesting that the bearish move could resume in the coming days, with a break below 137.20 as the next target. On the flip side, if bullish momentum continues, the next hurdle for buyers will be the area between 140.50 and 140.90.

In the realm of pattern analysis, ascending triangles are often grouped with bull flags, which encompass various patterns like pennants, wedges, symmetrical triangles, and bull channels. These patterns typically signify a pause in an uptrend, indicating a period of consolidation in the market. However, during this consolidation phase, a subtle battle unfolds as buyers seek to accumulate while sellers aim to distribute. The challenge lies in determining which side has the upper hand and this is what makes ascending triangles so useful. Ascending triangles stand out from the crowd of bull flags due to one crucial distinction: The sequence of higher swing lows meeting a horizontal resistance level serves as a unique indicator that buying pressure is on the rise even as the market consolidates. This particular characteristic sets ascending triangles apart from other bull flag patterns, rendering them notably more potent. Begin by scanning price charts for the distinctive pattern of higher swing lows connected by an ascending trendline and a horizontal resistance line. Confirmation of the pattern requires at least two reaction highs and two reaction lows. Look for entry opportunities when the price breaks above the horizontal resistance line, signalling a potential bullish breakout. Some traders may prefer to enter early by buying near the ascending trendline with a stop-loss order below it. To manage risk, place a stop-loss order below the ascending trendline or below the most recent swing low. Calculate potential price targets by measuring the height of the triangle's vertical distance and projecting it upward from the breakout point. Additionally, consider previous swing highs or key resistance levels as potential targets. While the ascending triangle pattern holds its own in providing valuable insights, incorporating can significantly enhance its effectiveness. This additional dimension serves as both a quality filter and a confirmation tool before committing to ascending triangle breakouts. : During the development of the ascending triangle, a common occurrence is a gradual decline in trading volume. : Ideally, a breakout should be marked by a noticeable surge in trading volume. This surge acts as a validation of the breakout's strength and serves as a crucial deterrent against false signals. Be aware that ascending triangles can sometimes experience false breakouts, where the price briefly moves above the resistance line before reversing lower. This highlights the importance of waiting for confirmation and monitoring volume during the breakout. Implement proper risk management techniques, such as position sizing, setting stop-loss orders, and diversifying your trading portfolio. This helps protect against unexpected market movements and potential losses. Don't rely solely on the ascending triangle pattern for trading decisions.

Additionally, as tech stocks suffered from high inflation and market tourmoil, Alphabet shed 39% of its last year, compared with the tech-heavy S&P 500 Index ( ) which lost 19% of its value. However, the tables appear to have since turned for the company that owns the world’s largest search engine. As of 30 May, GOOGL stock price was up almost 40% year-to-date ( ). What lies ahead for the tech giant for the rest of 2023? Will its gains continue or is a reversal inevitable? In this article, we take a look at Alphabet’s financial fundamentals, the latest news surrounding the company, and the Google stock forecast for the short and long term. On 10 August 2015, Larry Page, one of Google’s co-founders, published the blog post , in which he announced the restructuring of one of the world’s biggest companies. Page mentioned the need to make the company cleaner and more accountable through a new publicly traded entity. That company became Alphabet. The new name was chosen to reflect the sentiment of ‘alpha-bet’ (Alpha implies investment return over benchmark). On 2 October 2015, both classes of Google shares began trading on Nasdaq as and fully converted into the same number of shares with the same rights, making Google a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet. Alphabet remains the holding company for more than 160 subsidiary companies, the largest being Google. The Covid-19 pandemic, and subsequent global lockdowns saw many people begin working remotely, this led to a steep upward trend in the as companies and individuals became more reliant on technology to communicate over a distance. GOOGL opened 2020 at $67.42 on 2 January 2020 and would close at $86.81 on 31 December, a 28% rise. Growth continued into 2021, as the company reached an all-time high of $150.97 on 19 November. Although the price dipped slightly in the following days, it would remain around the $140 mark until the end of the year. The stock price started 2022 at $145.05 and remained relatively steady for the first quarter. However, as macroeconomic headwinds hit tech companies, the stock began a downtrend that saw it close April at $114.11. On 27 July 2022, the tech giant released its . Though the earnings , they were better than many had feared and prompted a rebound in the stock price, which jumped 7.6% the day the results were reported, from $105.02 on 26 July to $113.06. However, the stock would soon hit a downtrend. On 21 September 2022 it dropped below $100 for the first time since early 2021 and on 2 November it reached its lowest point of the year at $83.34. So far, 2023 has seemed a lot more positive for GOOGL. The stock opened this year $89.59 and continuing with a slow but steady uptrend. On 23 January, the price edged over the $100 mark once again. The price hit another downturn in February, amid rising competition in internet searches from artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT, falling to a low of $88.58 on 24 February. However, the stock would rebound once again, rising above the $100 mark on 16 March, and continuing to trend above that level in the following months. In May, GOOGL stock saw a significant upturn following the , in which the company announced plans to utilise many AI in much of its technology, including writing tools for gmail, and creating docs and spreadsheets. The news was well received by GOOGL investors, many of whom had feared that the tech innovator was falling behind in the quickly evolving area of artificial intelligence, following the fellow tech company Microsoft ( ) $10bn investment in ChatGPT parent company Open AI. As of 30 May, GOOGL was trading at $124.61. In the most recent Google CEO Sundar Pichai said: The first quarter of the year was a relatively solid one for Alphabet, with its consolidated revenue coming in at $69.8bn, growing 3% year-over-year ( ). However, earnings per share ( ) was at $1.17 falling from $1.23 the previous year. Costs and expenses also increased 3.4%, from $29.6bn in Q1 2022 to $30.6bn. This was likely to be expected, as in 2022 the company said it would take a charge of between $1.9bn and $2.3bn, mostly in the first quarter of 2023, related to the layoffs of 12,000 employees it announced in January. It also expected to incur costs of about $500 million related to reduced office space in Q1. Meanwhile, on 21 April 2022, Alphabet announced that it would combine its DeepMind and Google Brain AI research units, ending a long-running internal rivalry between the London and Silicon Valley-based groups as it tries to make up lost ground in generative AI against Microsoft and OpenAI. On 17 April, Alphabet lost about $55bn in market value after a report from suggested that competition was heating up in the mobile search market. In its Q4 2021 earnings report, Alphabet announced its decision of a by way of a one-time special dividend on each share of the company’s Class A, Class B and Class C stock. Stockholders recorded in the company’s books at the close of business on 1 July 2022 received 19 additional shares of the same class of stock that they already held by the close of 15 July 2022.

In this article, we take a look at the index composition, price performance and S&P 500 forecasts for 2023 and beyond from analysts. An in-depth sector analysis of the index could offer more clarity on the driving forces that will shape the S&P 500 predictions in 2023. As the most widely cited indicator of the performance of US large-cap , the S&P 500, alongside the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average Index ( ) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index ( ), represents one of the three primary benchmark indices for US stock markets. The S&P 500 is weighted by , meaning that its constituents with higher market caps are accorded more significant weightings. The information technology sector accounted for the highest weighting on the S&P 500 at 26.1%, according to as of 31 March. It was followed by healthcare and financials, with weightings of 14.2% and 12.9%, respectively. Among the index's 503 components, technology stocks topped the list, with Apple ( ) holding the highest weighting, followed by Microsoft ( ), Amazon ( ), Nvidia ( ), and Alphabet ( ). Between March 2020 and January 2022, ultra-low fueled a meteoric rally that saw the S&P 500 surge about 120%, from a peak pandemic low of 2,191 points to an all-time high of 4,818 points by 3 January 2022. 2022 has been a different story as multi-decade-high inflation forced the US Federal Reserve ( ) to end its \"goldilocks\" . The invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February further added to cost pressures by pushing energy and commodity prices higher. What followed was an aggressive tightening cycle by the Fed that saw interest rates surge from 0%-0.25% in March 2022 to 4.75%-5% a year later, pushing borrowing costs to new highs since 2007. Between 2022 and 2023 the US benchmark index has lost over 20%. Yet in 2023, the expected slowing of the policy tightening is giving fresh hopes to the S&P 500. Year-to-date, the index has gained over 8% as of 17 April, driven by lower-than-expected US March inflation reading and upbeat earnings by US banks. As explained by Capital.com’s market analyst Daniela Hathorn: There is some early optimism about the first-quarter earnings season, with some US banks already beating analyst expectations. This follows a slump in i for the lenders since the . JPMorgan Chase's ( ) first-quarter net income rose by 52% year-on-year, with the bank receiving $37bn in deposits following SVB's tumble, according to the . Citigroup's ( ) Q1 net income also rose to $4.6bn, or $2.19 per share, driven by strong consumer spending and corporate activity, the showed. The bank's profits were further boosted by planned sales, including a consumer banking business in India.

Meanwhile, the showed that 90% of companies that reported so far have beat estimates in earnings per share ( ), which is above five-year and ten-year averages. The positive earnings surprises are led by financial stocks, such as banks. Analysts at Morgan Stanley, however, were more cautious about the upcoming earnings, pointing out that the EPS forecast for the S&P 500 has fallen at a rate of approximately 9% per annum since peaking in June 2022. Mike Wilson, chief US equity strategist and CIO at the bank, explained in a note on 16 April: Inflation and interest rate decisions by the US central bank have been major driving forces behind S&P 500 index price. The March US Consumer Price Index ( ) data showed year-on-year inflation of 5% in March. The reading was the ninth consecutive month of decline in inflation, and lower than expected by analysts, which gave a boost to US equities. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley’s Wilson expressed scepticism about the bullishness following the reading: According to Capital.com’s Daniela, the latest FOMC meeting minutes “failed to reveal any new information, evidencing that some members had weighted stopping rate hikes at the March meeting after the banking rout, but still on track to continue tightening.” Meanwhile, analysts expect the rates to peak somewhere in 2023. The Dutch bank , for example, as of 6 April forecasts saw the rates peak at 5.25% in the third quarter, before slowing down to 4.25% at the end of the year.

Meanwhile, showed that industry analysts were predicting a 17% increase in the index price over the next year. The Energy sector was expected to see the largest price increase (+31.9%), while the Information Technology sector was expected to see the smallest price increase (+6.3%). The economic data provider gave a price target of 4,006.48 by the end of the first quarter, and predicted a slump to 3,637.41 in one year according to their global macro projections and analysts expectations as of 17 April. With so many uncertainties at play, analysts did not provide an S&P 500 forecast for 2025 or S&P 500 forecast for 2030. In the short-term, Capital.com’s Hathorn pointed out that the recent surge in the US stocks seems “overextended, but the technicals are still supporting a path of least higher.” Note that analysts’ forecasts and price targets can be wrong and shouldn’t be used as a substitute for your own research. Make sure to always conduct your own due diligence before trading, and never trade more money than you can afford to lose.

After briefly reaching a low of 1.11 in February, the exchange rate rose to 1.155 on 10 May, its highest level since December 2022. The start of 2023 was a whirlwind of of mixed economic data, banking industry turmoil and tightening. March came and the Bank of England ( ) raised by 25 basis points (bps) at its March meeting, bringing the rate to 4.25%. Meanwhile, on the continent the European Central Bank ( ) hiked rates by 50 bps to 4%, the highest level since the . With both UK and economies under pressure from inflation and rate hikes, what does the outlook look like for the foreign exchange ( ) rate? Patrick Locke, Global FX Strategist at J.P. Morgan said: In this article, we look at the latest GBP/EUR predictions from analysts, and what factors will influence the exchange rate in the future. The GBP/EUR pair represents how many euros – the quote currency – are needed to buy one British pound – the base currency. The pair is one of the most frequently traded on the FX markets. Sterling is the former global and one of the strongest in the world, while the euro is the second most traded currency in the world after the US dollar (USD). Both the GBP and EUR represent major global financial and trading centres. Macroeconomic indicators, including GDP, , , services and manufacturing activity and unemployment, market sentiment and consumer confidence, all drive the currency markets, as they affect a country’s attractiveness to investors and, in turn, demand for its currency. These economic readings are key in shaping a GBP/EUR forecast. Market sentiment is a key driver for the GBP/EUR pair. The uncertainty surrounding negotiations between the UK and the EU over the UK’s exit from the bloc have weighed on the value of sterling since the 2016 referendum. More recently, concerns over the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on inflation in the UK and the eurozone have influenced the direction of the exchange rate. After falling in March 2020 from 1.20 to 1.08 on concerns about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the UK economy, the GBP/EUR pair has remained . The rate quickly moved up to 1.1495 in April 2020, but then trended lower over the summer to return to the 1.08 level in September 2020. The pair then began to trend higher as the introduction of Covid-19 vaccines raised hopes that the UK economy would start to recover from lockdowns. The upward trend continued into 2021, with the pair reaching 1.1761 in late March. The pair dipped to 1.1474 in April 2021 but then moved into a trading range between 1.16 and 1.18 for the rest of the year. The GBP/EUR pair moved above 1.19 in January 2022, after the Bank of England ( ) kicked off a series of interest rate hikes in December 2021 with a 15-basis point increase to 0.25%. The GBP/EUR pair briefly moved back above 1.21 in late February 2022 as traders weighed the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on the eurozone economy, anticipating a stronger impact than on the UK economy. But the pair began to slide in April and dropped to 1.16 on 26 June 2022. The pair struggled through high volatility throughout August and September 2022, dropping to an intraday low of €1.08 on 26 September following a disastrous mini-budget of the Liz Truss government. Since then the British pound recovered some losses, yet moved lower in 2023. Since the start of the year, the pair has been trading between 1.11 and 1.14 for the first three months of 2023. INFOGRAPHICS: PLEASE REDESIGN THE CHART BELOW, without today’s price GBP/EUR exchange rate, 2018 - 2023 The pound has shown resilience in the last month amid better than expected UK economic performance. The kingdom’s between November 2022 and January 2023, 0.1% higher than the previous ONS reading. Meanwhile, the economy expanded by 0.3% month-on-month in January, beating the 0.1% growth expected by analysis. Jane Foley, Rabobank’s senior FX strategist, commented on 22 March: Meanwhile, the UK’s inflation is still a concern for the British currency. The consumer price index ( ) rose by 10.4% in the 12 months to February 2023, up from 10.1% in December. HSBC, however, has revised down their inflation forecast when the UK government announced the energy price freeze at the current levels. Elizabeth Martins, HSBC’s senior economist, commented: The banking fallout triggered by the that saw troubled has hurt investors’ confidence in the Eurozone, hitting the European currency and the block’s banking stocks. The current ECB rhetoric is that the banking sector is strong, aimed at restoring market sentiment. Yet as explained by Rabobank’s Jane Foley: In their latest outlook issued on 20 March, was bullish on the British pound, predicting the GBP rise to $1.22 in the next three months, accelerating to $1.25 in 6-12 months, and trading at $1.40 in the long-term. The US investment bank’s forecast for EUR/USD saw the currency pair trading at $1.10 in three months, $1.15 in 6-12 months, and $1.20 in the long-term. While Citibank didn’t provide a direct pound to euro we can calculate their GBP/EUR forecast for 2023 from the price targets above. The cross rate from the forecasts above concludes that the bank expected the rate to trade at €1.109 in three months, slumping to €1.08 in the next year, yet recovering to €1.166 in the long term. Meanwhile, Rabobank’s Jane Foley expected EUR/GBP to edge to £0.88 in the next three months, which would amount to the GBP/EUR forecast of €1.136. The market strategist said that further policy by BoE would be key in determining the outlook: Analysts at JP Morgan have forceasted that the GBP/USD is forecast to fall to 1.18 in June 2023, to 1.16 in September 2023 and to 1.15 in December 2023. Locke said: As of 12 May, the GBP/EUR forecast from expected the exchange rate to trade at 1.24 by the end of the second quarter of 2023, and at 1.11939 in early 2024, based on global macro models projections and analysts expectations. The GBP/EUR forecast for 2023 from algorithm-based forecaster was bullish on the long-term outlook, predicting that the pair could trade at 1.124 in early 2024, and at 1.158 in five years’ time. The site’s GBP/EUR forecast for 2025 saw the pair trading at 1.133 in January of that year. Analysts have not issued a GBP/EUR forecast for 2030, yet went as far as 2028, predicting the pair to start that year at 1.158. When evaluating any pound to euro forecast, it’s important to keep in mind that forex markets are highly volatile, making it difficult to make accurate long-term estimates. Hence analysts’ and algorithm-based predictions are often wrong. We recommend that you always do your own research. Look at the latest news, a wide range of commentary, and before trading. Keep in mind that past performance is no guarantee of future returns, and never trade more money than you can afford to lose. The GBP/EUR currency pair started 2023 on a strong foot amid reports of strong UK labour market and upbeat corporate earnings data, which may mean more aggressive interest rate hikes by the Bank of England (BoE). However, since then GBP/EUR exchange rate has been caught in a whirlwind of mixed economic data, banking industry turmoil. As of 20 March, Citibank expected GBP/EUR to trade at €1.109 in three months, slumping to €1.08 in the next year, yet recovering to €1.166 in the long term. Meanwhile, Rabobank’s prediction was €1.136 in the next three months. Note that their predictions can be wrong. The busiest time for the GBP/EUR market is typically during European trading hours between 07:00-16:00 GMT. Releases of major macroeconomic data and monetary policy statements tend to drive volatility on currency markets, increasing liquidity and creating opportunities for traders to profit. However, you should keep in mind that high volatility increases risks of losses. How you should trade the GBP/EUR pair is a personal decision you should make based on your risk tolerance, investing strategy and portfolio composition, after researching the market to understand the latest trends, news and analysis. Keep in mind that past performance is no guarantee of future returns, and never trade money you cannot afford to lose.

What do the next 10 years have in store? The innovative firm replaced ExxonMobil ( ) as the world’s largest company in 2011, and became the first trillion-dollar public company seven years later. But where will it go next? Technology moves rapidly, so the question for investors is whether Apple can stay one step ahead of its fierce competition. In this Apple long-term stock forecast, we look at how the company makes its money, outline its plans for the future, and ask how much will be worth in 10 years' time. Apple has been a technological success story. Founded back in the 1970s, it has grown into a multinational giant and a leading name in the sector. Its hugely popular range of mobile phones and computers boast an intensely loyal fanbase around the world, eager to snap up the latest models. Apple is probably best known for its iconic iPhones. The first iPhone appeared 15 years ago, and each new launch triggers a buying frenzy at stores around the world. This success is one of the reasons why Apple remains the world’s largest company, with a market capitalisation of more than $2trn, according to . Apple went public on 12 December 1980 with the price at $22 a share. The company’s stock has split five times since – on a split-adjusted basis, the IPO price was $10. Long-term investors in Apple have every right to celebrate – AAPL stock has risen a remarkable 546% over the past 10 years. Back in January 2013, shares stood at a modest $19.60, but hit their all-time high of $180.73 on 3 January 2022. However, a difficult 2022 saw the multinational technology company lose 30% of its stock value. But it seems that 2023 is starting to treat Apple a little better. Since the start of 2023, AAPL stock price has been up 29% year-to-date (YTD). As the market closed on 19 April, 2023, the price was $167.63. In addition, Apple is still currently worth more than Alphabet ( ) and Amazon ( ) combined. Over the past 15 years, meanwhile, the company has achieved trailing returns of 22.39% – ahead of the 20.31% recorded by the industry, according to data to the same date. There are several factors that drive Apple's stock price and one of them is market sentiment, whihc is an intangible factor. Apple is expected to beat market estimates and the expectation is that Apple will post higher than the estimate, when they realease their earning reults. Other factors that affect Apple stock are the groups iPhone sales, which is one of its key revenue generators. Apple's iPhone sales accounted for of the company's overall revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, the largest share of all Apple products. But increased competition from Android phones could hurt its market share. Another factor driving Apple's stock is Tablet, laptop and computer sales for both corporate and consumer users. This is an essential element of Apple's revenue and stock price. 61 million iPads and 26 million Mac and MacBook units were sold in . Apple services, which inculdes music, movies, TV shows, stickers, books, and app purchases has also contributed to Apple's success. Of course, Apple hasn’t been immune to stock market turbulence, and has been affected by last year’s lack of enthusiasm for . This is one of the main reasons why AAPL shares fell 30% over the course of 2022. Apple last posted its quarterly on 2nd February 2023. The iPhone maker reported $1.88 EPS for the quarter, missing analysts' consensus estimates of $1.93 by $0.05. The business had revenue of $117.15 billion for the quarter, compared to the consensus estimate of $121.67 billion. Its revenue for the quarter was down 5.5% compared to the same quarter last year. Apple CEO Tim Cook commented: In April 2022, the company an acceleration of its US investments, with plans to make new contributions of more than $430bn – and create 20,000 jobs – over the next five years. It also stated that its contributions in the US over the past three years have “significantly outpaced” its original five-year goal of $350bn set in 2018. Cook said Apple was “doubling down” on its commitment to US innovation with an investment reaching communities across all 50 states. Currently, Apple supports more than two million jobs across the United States through direct employment, spending with US suppliers and manufacturers, and developer jobs in the thriving iOS app economy. The company also has one eye on its broader responsibilities. Apple has made no secret about its ambitions in the healthcare market. The company has developed a custom chip to process data from the health and wellness sensors on the Apple Watch and partnered with the Department of Veterans Affairs to develop the Health Records feature on the iPhone. It seems that Apple has now set it sights on helping those with diabetes. Apple has developed a non-invasive way to test blood glucose levels, according to reports. Accurately predicting what will happen to a company and its share price over the coming decade is practically impossible. However, market analysts and algorithm-based websites regularly provide approximations and price projections based on models and historical data. As of 5 January 2023, AAPL was a ‘strong buy’, based on the Apple stock predictions of 27 analysts compiled by . While 22 analysts believed AAPL was a ‘buy’, the remaining five gave it a ‘hold’ rating. No analyst rating suggested the stock should be sold. Their consensus view was that the stock could rise to $176.70 over the coming year. The most optimistic believed it could hit $210, with the lowest prediction coming in at $140. According to , it was projected that Apple's share price could reach $220 by the end of 2023, $250 in 2024. Apple long term stock forecast is anticipated to be $315 in 2025, $370 in 2026, $425 in 2027, $465 in 2028, and $480 in 2029. In 2030, analysts anticipate Apple shares will be worth $510. Taking a closer look at the Apple stock projections of analysts, Daniel Ives of Wedbush recently reiterated his ‘buy’ recommendation with a $175 target price. However, Jerome Ramel has downgraded his to ‘hold’ with a $140 target price. According to the algorithmic forecasting website , Apple is “a bad long-term (one year) investment”, the AAPL stock price was expected to fall 14% to $108.77 over the next 12 months. Over the longer term, the site’s five-year AAPL stock forecast was even worse, with the stock expected to be trading at $38.26 by January 2028. The Apple stock forecast 2030 from , as of 4 January 2023, suggested the stock could hit $165 by the end of this year, and move up to $235 by the end of 2025. Where will Apple stock be in 10 years? CoinPriceForecast anticipated AAPL could be at $417 by the end of 2033 and hit $439 by the end of the following year. So where will Apple stock be in 10 years' time? David Jones, former chief market strategist at Capital.com, pointed out that the Apple stock price has risen by more than 500% over the past decade, which represents an incredible return for anyone who has managed to hold shares for that long. Jones added: However, there are some concerns. According to Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, Apple’s disappointing iPhone sales are problematic. Apple is putting a lot of pressure on its brand to offset the very real pressures of inflation. Streeter opined that the company's performance in the coming months would remain stable, despite the headwinds: Streeter also pointed out that competitors were closing the gap on Apple, with some boasting an “even larger installed product base” and better prices. This, of course, could have a bearing on the Apple stock price in 10 years’ time. She added: The may have fallen last year, along with other technology stocks, but there are reasons for longer-term optimism, according to Danni Hewson, a financial analyst at AJ Bell. However, a lot of the company's future success will depend on how it handles the problems affecting its business, no matter how long they last. “It does have headwinds to contend with, not least the potential for further supply chain disruption from Covid lockdowns in China and a slowing of growth in that lucrative market,” she said. Hewson pointed out that it also has to contend with the ruling by EU officials that any mobile electronic devices sold within the region must come with a USB-C charging port by autumn 2024. Looking forward to the Apple stock price in 10 years’ time, note that analysts’ and algorithm-based predictions can go wrong. They are based on fundamental and technical analysis of the stock’s past performance, but that never guarantees future results. It’s important to do your own research and always remember that your decision to trade depends on your attitude to risk, your expertise in the market, the spread of your portfolio and how comfortable you feel about losing money. You should never trade more than you can afford to lose. The company is a technology giant that makes products hugely popular around the world. Its share price has been strong over the past five years, but you must carry out your own analysis to decide if it’s likely to rise over the coming decade. Ten years is a very long time span for accurate stock price predictions. As of 4 January 2023, the average market rating for Apple stock was ‘strong buy’, according to data compiled by . No-one knows for sure. It’s crucial to do your own research to form an opinion of a company’s performance and likelihood of achieving analysts’ targets. You must also remember that markets are volatile, and that past performance is no indication of future returns. Never invest any money that you cannot afford to lose. Whether AAPL stock is a suitable investment for you will depend on your personal research, trading strategy and investment needs. You need to perform your own due diligence and decide if the stock meets your needs and appetite for risk. Never invest any money that you cannot afford to lose.

Stock indices have been building bullish momentum for the past month as traders seemed to be relieved that the potential for a widespread banking crisis was narrowly avoided. Traders continue to believe the Federal Reserve is mistaken in thinking they can hold the terminal rate above 5% by year-end, with markets pricing in a rate of 4.1% in December, a full percentage below the central bank’s predictions. The current range stands at 4.75% - 5% after the Fed delivered another 25bps hike at their March meeting. Markets had started to lean in favour of that being the last rate hike and therefore the terminal rate, but after last Friday’s jobs data the current pricing is showing a 70% chance of another 25bps hike in May. The fact is that the unemployment rate unexpectedly dipped once again and labour conditions remain tight, something that Powell had hoped would have shown further signs of loosening by now. As expected, this caused a little bit of concern for equity traders and led to US stocks consolidating sideways for the beginning of this week, aided also by the reduced flows due to the Easter holiday. But Wednesday brought most of the excitement this week with the March US CPI data release and the FOMC meeting minutes. The first gave a pleasant surprise as year-on-year inflation rose less than expected, coming in at 5% vs 5.2%, and dropping from 6% in February. The release gave a boost to equities and commodities and caused a bit of a tumble in US yields. That said, core inflation rose slightly from the previous month, which was already anticipated by markets, but nonetheless, it proves that domestic price pressures remain sticky, especially within the services sector. The feeling was further cemented by the fall in producer prices (PPI) released on Thursday, showing that price pressures have eased at the beginning of the production line. The FOMC meeting minutes failed to reveal any new information, evidencing that some members had weighed stopping rate hikes at the March meeting after the banking rout, but still on track to continue tightening. In fact, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic reiterated this morning that one more quarter-percentage-point interest rate hike can allow the Federal Reserve to end its tightening cycle with some confidence inflation will steadily return to the U.S. central bank's 2% target. The recent rally in US indices does seem slightly overextended but the technicals are still supporting a path of least resistance higher. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see some consolidation over the coming days, with the potential even for a minor pullback, which would allow for a more healthy and sustained rally. The S&P 500 has already started to show signs of a pause in the uptrend as the index has found resistance at 4,150 for the third session in a row. From here up until the 4,200 is where we saw a confluence of selling pressure back in February when it last attempted to break higher, and that led to a reversal back down to 3,800. We could see this pattern repeat itself although sellers would first need to break through support at 4,069 to consider the trend reversal to be unfolding. For commodities, gold and silver have shown remarkable strength over the last month, with silver outshining gold over the last few weeks. Fears over a potential recession, boosted by the banking drama at the beginning of March, have been keeping precious metals supported as they take advantage of their safe haven appeal. But the lack of pullbacks, especially in silver, makes the recent rally slightly unsustainable and therefore, despite the potential for long-term appreciation, traders could be looking for a short-term reversal to consider a better entry point. So far there seems to be some resistance after the strong push higher this week, especially for silver which is likely to face increased selling pressure between 26.21 and 26.96, a key area of confluence which has caused price reversals in the past. With regards to oil, US crude (WTI) seems to have worn out the bullish momentum seen at the open last week as OPEC+ announced a series of production cuts. The liquid gold did get a boost on Wednesday after the CPI release as it followed the general risk-on sentiment in the market but with rising levels of inventories renewing fears about a weaker demand outlook in the face of a global recession buyers have been struggling to find a reason to buy at current levels. Moreover, WTI was facing key resistance between 80.65 and 82.54, an area that seemed to have been broken after Wednesday’s renewed bullish momentum. But the commodity iOS back trading within this range in Friday’s session, suggesting that there is still a lack of momentum to see a sustained break higher. This is also where the 200-day simple moving average is converging (82.68) which adds an extra layer of resistance for buyers. Given the recent moves, it looks like we may see further sideways consolidation along these lines next week as traders look for a fresh reason to break away.

While investors cheered the stock split news earlier in the year, concerns about macroeconomic headwinds have pushed and shares to a two-year low in early November 2022. Since then, Alphabet shares have partially recovered, trading with a 19% year-to-date gain, as of 5 April 2023. In this article we will talk about the Google stock split, latest Alphabet earnings and latest analyst views on Alphabet’s stock outlook. A is a corporate action in which a company issues additional stock to its shareholders at a predetermined ratio. A stock split will result in an increase in the number of shares held by existing shareholders but will see its price reduced by the stock split ratio. The total dollar value of all shares will not change due to a stock split. The research firm explained the concept in a blog post: Common stock split ratios are 2-for-1 or 3-for-1, where a shareholder receives an additional one or two shares for every stock held. The unit price of the stock will fall by a division of two or three, accordingly, after the split takes place. Stock splits are also referred to as “one-time special stock dividend” in corporate announcements. A company can choose to split its stock multiple times, subject to shareholder approval. On 15 July 2022, in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each Class A, Class B and Class C share. The company’s board of directors previously approved the stock split on 1 February 2022, and its shareholders approved the plan at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on 1 June, with the Google stock split date set for 15 July. The tech giant has stock divided into three classes: : GOOGL shares listed in public markets and traded on stock exchanges with regular voting rights. : shares held by the company’s founders, with 10 times more voting power than Class A. Not listed in public markets. : GOOG shares listed in public markets and traded on stock exchanges, with no voting rights. Investors cheered the Google stock split news as Alphabet Class A shares surged over 7.5% on the following day. Companies carry out stock splits with the intent of making their stock prices more attractive to retail investors. Big Tech companies, including Apple ( ), Tesla ( ), Nvidia ( ) and Amazon ( ), have announced or carried out stock splits of their own in 2022, having seen their share prices soar in the aftermath. It should be mentioned that the higher share price of company A versus company B does not mean that A is more valuable than B. A company’s market value is usually measured by its , which is calculated by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares by the unit share price. Stock splits do not directly affect a company’s market capitalisation. However, as investors anticipate increased retail interest after stock splits, a company announcing a stock split could see its share price rise on the news. As explained by Morningstar: Markets tend to react positively to stock split news. GOOGL stock jumped over 7% one day after the announcement of its stock split on 2 February 2022. As trading began on 18 July, Alphabet class A stock opened at a split-adjusted price of $112.64. Google’s stock price before the split was $2,255.34 as the market closed on 15 July. Yet on the day of the split and its aftermath, the stock actually moved sideways and failed to pick up since then. Meanwhile, historical analysis of stock splits have shown that share prices of a company typically rise after the announcement of any stock split and fall after its implementation. A Google share split has only once taken place prior to 15 July 2022 – before the firm was under its current parent company, Alphabet. In March 2014, the company enacted a 2-for-1 stock split, although rather than doubling of shares, it issued new Class C shares devoid of voting rights. Consequently, for each class A share held, investors received one Class C share, effectively safeguarding the founders’ voting power. The stock split, initially announced in early 2012, faced opposition from shareholders, culminating in a lawsuit, which was resolved in 2013, clearing the path for the split. Google parent company Alphabet Inc. has reported its , revealing a moderate growth in revenue but a dip in operating income. The company's Q4 consolidated revenues reached $76bn, a 1% year-over-year increase, while full-year 2022 revenues climbed 10% to $283bn. However, Q4 operating income dropped to $18.16bn, down from $21.88bn in 2021, with the operating margin shrinking from 29% to 24%. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai attributed the company's growth to its long-term investments in artificial intelligence (AI), noting that \"AI-driven leaps\" in search and other areas are on the horizon. He also cited strong momentum in Google Cloud, YouTube subscriptions, and Pixel devices, with Alphabet's CFO Ruth Porat highlighting ongoing efforts to improve cost structures and support investments in high-growth areas. Diluted earnings per share ( ) for Q4 came in at $1.05, down from $1.53 in the same period in 2021. The full-year 2022 EPS was $4.56, lower than 2021's $5.61. Google's advertising revenues for Q4 reached $59.04bn, with Google Search & other, YouTube ads, and Google Network generating $42.6bn, $7.96bn, and $8.47bn, respectively. In January 2023, Alphabet announced plans to cut approximately 12,000 roles from its workforce, with expected severance and related charges ranging from $1.9bn to $2.3bn. The company also anticipates incurring exit costs of approximately $0.5bn in Q1 2023 due to global office space optimization. The financial results come amid Alphabet's ongoing endeavours to restructure its cost base and capitalise on the potential of AI across its businesses. As part of these efforts, the company will recategorize DeepMind, previously reported under Other Bets, as part of its corporate costs to reflect increased collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets. As of 5 April, the average stock price prediction for Alphabet stood at $131.39, according to the latest data from . The highest projected price target was $165.00, while the lowest estimate came in at $113.00. Recent analyst ratings for GOOGL stock have been predominantly positive: On April 3, Needham & Company LLC reiterated their 'Buy' rating and set a price target of $115, reflecting a 12.29% upside potential on the report date. Piper Sandler maintained an 'Outperform' rating on March 31, but slightly lowered their target from $120 to $117, still indicating a 14.01% upside as of the report date. Stifel Nicolaus initiated coverage of Alphabet with a 'Buy' rating and a $130 price target on March 20, suggesting a 28.43% upside on the report date. BNP Paribas upgraded the stock from 'Neutral' to 'Outperform' on 17 March setting a target of $123, which represented a 22.61% increase on the report date. JMP Securities reiterated their 'Market Outperform' rating on 16 March, with a price target of $132, implying a 31.58% upside on the report date. According to an analyst note from Zacks Investment Research, Google's dominant search market share, expanding cloud footprint, and strengthening presence in the smart home market, such as its Google Nest brand, are positive factors for the company’s future. Additionally, the acquisition of Fitbit has allowed Google to enter the lucrative healthcare market, and may offer valuable insights to medical professionals. The analysts noted: Alphabet's 92.2% market share in the global search engine market, its growing presence in the mobile search sector, and its 29 cloud regions and 88 availability zones worldwide were cited as other positives. However, there were some concerns too. Alphabet's diversification strategy involves significant investment in various sectors, increasing competition, legal hassles, and regulatory scrutiny. As of 5 April, analysts anticipated sales and marketing expenses for Q1 2023 to grow 14.8% year-on-year, and Research and Development (R&D) expenses to grow 17% year-on-year. If fixed costs increase without a corresponding increase in revenue, margins could trend downward. Other margin pressures included currency fluctuations, international growth, lower-priced YouTube clicks, and the strength of the mobile platform. Additionally, Alphabet's lack of success in building a strong social platform could hinder the company's growth in location-based commerce via mobile devices, Zacks analysts said. Note that analyst predictions about the future of Alphabet shares may be wrong and should not be used as a substitute to your own research. Make sure to conduct your own due diligence, looking at the latest news, and , and a wide range of commentary. Google-parent Alphabet split its stock on a 20-for-1 basis after the market closed on 15 July 2022. Shareholders of Alphabet’s Class A, Class B and Class C stock received an additional 19 shares for each stock they owned after the 15 July 2022 market close. In March 2014, the company enacted a 2-for-1 stock split, although rather than doubling of shares, it issued new Class C shares devoid of voting rights.

The stock split, initially announced in early 2012, faced opposition from shareholders, culminating in a lawsuit, which was resolved in 2013, clearing the path for the split.

So far in 2023, the e-commerce giant has announced plans to make more than 25,000 members of staff redundant in two rounds of savage cuts. In January, CEO Andy Jassy confirmed that the company would let go more than 18,000 employees, the biggest reduction in Amazon’s workforce in its history. And in March, the company a further 9,000 people would be got rid of. Is this a signal that it expects to take a stronger hit as the global recession unfolds, or are the layoffs an attempt to stimulate business performance? Here we take a look at the potential and news that could have an impact on the . The company was founded as an online book shop in 1994 by entrepreneur Jeff Bezos, making it one of the first companies buying and selling goods online. In its early years, Amazon operated out of Bezos’s garage in Bellevue, Washington, USA. The firm officially debuted in October 1995, and in two months was earning $20,000 a week in sales. On 15 May 1997, the company went public at $18 a share, listing on the . However, it would be several years before Amazon would turn a profit. In the fourth quarter of 2001 – amid the bursting of the that saw the collapse of many e-commerce companies – Amazon posted a profit of $5m. The company would continue introducing new products over the following years, launching products and services, including two-day membership delivery Amazon Prime in 2005, electronic reading device Amazon Kindle in 2007, and electronic voice assistant Echo & Alexa in 2016. Amazon also branched out into music and film with Amazon Music and Amazon Instant Video. Amazon stock is currently trading at the same level it enjoyed in the spring of 2020, when markets across the board fell as governments across the world put in lockdowns in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Although the stock enjoyed a bull run in 2021, reaching a record $188.65 intraday high on 13 July that year, 2022 was very different, with the war in Ukraine, soaring inflation and aggressive monetary tightening seeing AMZN drop from $167.55 at the start of the year to $84 at the end. Following the first redundancies announcement, AMZN stock went on something of a bull run, reaching an intraday high of $99.32 on 18 January. At the end of the month, the stock price broke past $100 for the first time since November, reaching an intraday high of $114 on 2 February. Since then, the Amazon stock news has seen the share price go on something of a decline and, on 23 March, it closed the day at $98.71. In the press release confirming , Jassy encouraged investors: Market participants reacted negatively to the announcement, with the AMZN stock price falling 2.37% on the day. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said in a note shared with Capital.com that even though the workforce reduction is the biggest in history, it becomes a “drop in the ocean” when viewed in the context of the 1.5 million total Amazon employees. He added: Mould pointed out that the retail giant is likely to focus on its core e-commerce and Amazon Web Services cloud operations, noting that the announcement will be viewed positively by the shareholders as it signals higher returns. Announcing the second wave of redundancies, Jassy : \"This was a difficult decision, but one that we think is best for the company long term.\" He added: \"As our internal businesses evaluated what customers most care about, they made re-prioritisation decisions that sometimes led to role reductions, sometimes led to moving people from one initiative to another, and sometimes led to new openings where we don’t have the right skills match from our existing team members. In late April 2022, Amazon’s stock fell 14% on the day the company released its financial results for the . Back then, the company reported a $3.8bn net loss due to a $7.6bn markdown of its investment in Rivian ( ), the electric vehicle startup in which the company has a large stake. The stock price has not recovered with the US Federal Reserve ( ) bringing interest rates to 4.25%-4.5% at the December meeting. The aggressive monetary tightening coupled with the war in Ukraine has turned global sour, raising concerns about the US recession. Amazon is a large e-commerce business with revenues primarily coming from its North American business. The performance of the US economy is highly relevant to determine how the company will perform financially in the future. “Powell remained adamant, as we have noted, that he expects to maintain a significantly restrictive policy stance until incoming data support a high degree of confidence that inflation will fall to 2% on a sustained basis”, analysts from S&P Global commented in a . Meanwhile, around 30% of the global economy could be poised to enter a recession , while the largest three economies in the world – the US, China, and the European Union – will be growing at a slower rate compared to 2022. Amazon reported its results for the fourth quarter of 2022 on 2 February 2023. Net sales increased by 9% $149.2 billion, compared to $137.4 billion in fourth quarter of 2021. Operating income dropped to $2.7bn, compared to $3.5bn in the last three months of 2021, while net income dropped to $0.3 billion in the fourth quarter, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to $14.3 billion, or $1.39 per diluted share the previous year. The net income included a pre-tax valuation loss of $2.3 billion from non-operating income from the common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, compared to a pre-tax valuation gain of $11.8 billion from the investment in fourth quarter 2021 Let's take a look at some of the Amazon stock forecasts for 2023 and beyond.

Meanwhile, the highest Amazon stock forecast for 2024 was $192, with the lowest at $106. Analysts have been lowering their price targets for Amazon in the past year. According to data from , UBS Group, Evercore ISI, JPMorgan & Chase, and Piper Sandler have been among the firms to cut their 12-month Amazon share price forecasts from November 2022 to March 2023.

This marks quite a turn from 2022, when the shed almost 70% of its value. A key factor that has contributed to the Tesla stock price’s rise so far this year has been its price cuts. In January, the electric vehicle (EV) maker lowered the prices of two of its most popular vehicles vehicles, the Model Y and Model 3, across US and European markets. Tesla said in a statement: In this article, we explore further details about the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, along with predictions from analysts about the stock’s future. Tesla was founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, two engineers with a vision of revolutionising the auto industry by creating fully-functional, electric-powered vehicles. The company was not, contrary to popular belief, founded by Elon Musk. However, Musk was instrumental in Tesla’s success as he invested a sizeable amount of money in the company and helped to raise funds from venture capitalists and . The first vehicle launched by Tesla was the Roadster, in 2008. It then introduced new models, including the Model S, Model X, Model Y and Model 3. The Tesla Semi followed, together with a pick-up truck called the Cybertruck and a new Roadster model. Tesla is headquartered in Austin, Texas. The company has manufacturing facilities in the US (Texas, Nevada, California, and Buffalo), China and Germany. During the first nine months of 2022, Tesla produced of $57.1bn, $50.2bn of which came from the sale of its vehicles. During this same period, Tesla produced a total of 929,910 vehicles and delivered 908,573 units. Understanding the company’s history and current situation is a good first step in the process of drafting a plausible Tesla long-term forecast. Tesla stock has accumulated gains of 8,535% in the past 10 years compared to 348.9% and 187.6% returns produced by the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 index, respectively, during that same period. This means that the company’s has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 56.8% – an impressive return that hasn’t necessarily come without hiccups along the way. The chart above shows that in six months within the past 10 years, TSLA has experienced monthly drawdowns of more than 20%. This shows how volatile the stock has been and what it took from investors who adopted a buy-and-hold approach to stay the course to see the value of their holdings increase by the percentages described above. Tesla hit all-time highs (post-splits) in November 2021 at $414.50 a share, but changes in the macroeconomic backdrop led to a significant decline in its stock value after that, as investors adopted a risk-off attitude due to the US Federal Reserve’s increasingly hawkish actions. Investors must be aware that past results are not a guarantee of future performance, which means they should not base their Tesla stock predictions on what its price has done in the past. What kind of variables can investors look at to determine where the price of Tesla stock in 5 years may land? The company’s fundamentals are perhaps the first thing to consider when drafting a Tesla stock 5-year forecast. This includes an analysis of the demand for EVs in multiple corners of the world – primarily in the locations where Tesla is already offering its products, but also in markets the company may be planning to reach soon. Additionally, investors should also look at the competition and what they are doing to see if their vehicles may eventually eat up a portion of Tesla’s pie. According to data from , Tesla’s vehicles accounted for 65% of the sales in units of electric cars in the US in the first nine months of 2022. However, Tesla is also looking to become a major player in other parts of the world such as China and Europe. They will have to compete with firms like Nissan, Ford, General Motors, VW, Toyota, Nio and Xpeng to either become the leaders or stay at the top of the EV market in these areas. By analysing these elements, investors may be able to determine how much Tesla could bring in sales, cash flows and earnings in the next 5 years to possibly value the business by using price-to-earnings ratios and other similar techniques. Other variables that could shape the Tesla stock price in 5 years include macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, as higher rates will typically lead to lower equity valuations. In addition, higher rates may also depress the demand for vehicles, as borrowing costs will tend to increase. Lets look at the long term outlook for Tesla stock. As of 2 March, had the consensus recommendation from analysts for Tesla stock stood at ‘hold’, with 21 out of 36 analysts rating the stock a buy, 11 rating it a hold and four a sell. The average price target for TSLA for the next 12 months stood at $218.95 a share, implying an 7.98% upside potential if that target is hit. The highest prediction stood at $430.33 while the lowest sat at $33.33. As for the Tesla long term forecast, has estimated a Tesla 5 year forecast of $564.24 a share. Additionally, , another algorithm-based forecasting service, has a baseline Tesla stock 5-year forecast of $2,326.138. Both of these estimations indicate a sizeable upside potential for TSLA within the next five years, if those targets are hit. However, many things can happen during that period. Therefore, these forecasts should not be considered a recommendation to invest in Tesla stock. Investors should always perform their own due diligence on any company before buying shares. And never invest money you cannot afford to lose. No-one can say for sure. According to the estimates cited above, Tesla stock could be worth between $564 and $2,326.138 a share in the next five years, implying potential over 1,000% gains based on the last closing price of $181.41, though this seems an ambitious target. Remember, these predictions can be wrong. Always do your own research before making any investment or trading decision. And never invest more money than you are comfortable losing. Tesla was one of the first companies to manufacture a top-quality and fully-functional electric-powered vehicle. The company remains the leader of the EV market in the US in units sold and continues to move forward in the development of new models and markets. However, whether Tesla is the right stock for you depends on your trading objectives. It’s important to do your own research. Your decision to trade depends on your attitude to risk, your expertise in the market, the spread of your portfolio and how comfortable you feel about losing money. You should never trade more than you can afford to lose. The consensus recommendation from analysts surveyed by sat at ‘hold’ as of 2 March. Even though 21 out of 36 analysts have rated the stock a buy while 11 rated it a hold, and four a sell. However, how you invest is a personal decision depending on your risk tolerance and investing strategy. You should do your own research to take an informed view of the market and decide whether TSLA is an appropriate fit for your portfolio.

Yet who are the lucky shareholders of BlackRock and how much power do they have over the asset manager’s direction? Here we take a look at the . Blackrock was founded in New York in 1988 by eight financial professionals, including Larry Fink, Susan Wagner, Barbara Novick and Robert S. Kapito, who wanted to make the financial advisory industry more transparent and efficient. The company is best known for bringing innovation to what is considered a very pragmatic field by developing innovative portfolio management software known as Aladdin.

The stock traded at ₹194 as of 5 April at the National Stock Exchange of India ( ), 33% down from the April 2022 intraday high of ₹298.05. Indian energy companies are on analysts’ radars amid an ongoing power crisis and the country’s gradual move to clean energy. Indian power generation has been under pressure to increase coal imports amid rising electricity and persistently high coal prices. Can Tata Power’s stock price reverse its decline and what does Tata Power do? We look at the company’s share performance and what factors are driving the Tata Power share price forecast. Tata Power is the , with an installed generation capacity of 13,068 megawatts (MW). Through its power distribution subsidiaries such as Tata Power Mumbai Distribution and Tata Power Delhi Distribution, the Mumbai-based company serves 12.2 million customers. Apart from its power distribution business, the company operates 1,211 circuit kilometres (ckt.km) of transmission network in Mumbai and its suburbs. It also has a joint venture with Power Grid Corporation of India in the construction of 2,328 circuit kilometres (ckt) of transmission lines from Siliguri in West Bengal via Bihar to Mandola in Uttar Pradesh. Resurgent Power, a joint venture in which Tata holds a 26% stake, has obtained a letter of intent to acquire 100% shareholding in NRSS XXXVI, which is developing a 153 km transmission system. Tata Power is one of 29 publicly-listed subsidiaries of Indian multinational conglomerate Tata Group, which has businesses from steel and vehicles to hospitality. In April 2022, Tata Power share price reached an unprecedented intraday peak of ₹298.05, driven by a severe power shortage in the country and the company's foray into renewable energy, appreciating over 20% in the first week of April 2022. However, the rally has since tempered, with the stock experiencing a decline of more than 33% from the April 2022 zenith, as of 5 April 2023. Escalating interest rates, a considerable debt load, and an overall bearish market sentiment have thrust the stock into the negative territory, notwithstanding the impressive earnings in 2022. Furthermore, the mounting interest rates have elevated the cost of servicing debt for the Tata Group subsidiary. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), during its February 2023 policy meeting, increased the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.5%. This marked the central bank's sixth consecutive hike, raising the rate by 2.5% since May 2022. On 3 February, the Indian energy giant reported a , driven by growth across all its business segments. The company, which operates in Generation, Transmission & Distribution, Renewables, and Trading, posted a 91% year-on-year increase in Consolidated Profit After Tax (PAT) to ₹1,052 crore, marking the 13th consecutive quarter of PAT growth. Consolidated Revenue rose by 30% year-on-year to ₹14,339 crore, while Consolidated (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) climbed 53% year-on-year to ₹2,818 crore. These results solidified Tata Power’s position as India's premier green energy and consumer-centric power utility. Dr. Praveer Sinha, CEO & MD of Tata Power, expressed his satisfaction with the company's performance, stating: Looking forward to another successful quarter, Dr. Sinha expressed confidence in the company's ability to create greater value for all stakeholders. As India takes on the G20 Presidency, Tata Power pledged to remain committed to making the country's power sector future-ready through its groundbreaking work in green energy transition. With many factors at play, are Tata Power shares sell, buy or hold? Analysts have offered mixed views on a Tata Power stock forecast as the company continues to focus on increasing renewable energy capacity and expanding its distribution circle. Gejit BNP Paribas, in a 20 February analyst note, expressed concerns about volatile coal prices and unfavourable exchange rates in the near term, revising their rating on the stock to HOLD with a revised target price of ₹223. The analysts said: On the other hand, ICICI Securities, in a 6 February analyst note, revised its estimates for the full-year 2023 earnings and full-year 2024 earnings, factoring in higher coal prices and earnings from the sale of power from the Mundra plant. The analysts maintained a “Buy” rating with the price target of ₹262. BOB Capital Markets, in a 4 February analyst note, acknowledged that Tata Power fell slightly short of their estimates in the third quarter, but remained positive on the company as it cautiously adds renewable capacity without compromising on margins. The note said: BOB Capital Markets maintained its BUY rating on Tata Power and its target price of ₹271, citing key positive drivers as growth in renewables and return on equity improvement in green subsidiaries. When conducting a Tata Power share price prediction, keep in mind that analysts can be wrong. It is critical to conduct your own research. Your decision to trade should be influenced by your risk tolerance, market knowledge, and portfolio spread. And never trade money you cannot afford to lose. Analysts have mixed views on Tata Power stock prediction. Tata Power has a solid business footing and electricity demand is expected to remain robust, with renewable energy set to play a bigger role in India’s electricity provision Whether Tata Power stock is a suitable investment for you should depend on your own objectives.

The largest single-day drop since records began 30 years earlier. Yields of German 10-year Bunds dropped by around 55 bps. The drop came as two US banks, California-based Silicon Valley Bank and New York-based Signature Bank collapsed under the weight of heavy losses on their bond portfolios and a massive run on deposits. US Treasury notes’ two-year yields also fell by 61 bps on 13 March, the biggest one-day fall since 1982. German bunds are Germany’s form of sovereign debt issuance, equivalent to or UK gilts. The German state issues bunds to finance expenditures on things like roads and schools. They are highly attractive as assets. Bunds see their rates rise in response to several factors, but usually those associated with bearish times in the wider economy. They can rise in response to volatile market risk like high levels of high or a flagging stock market, or as a result of rising . Holding bunds is seen as safe haven investing, due to their low risk and high likelihood of returns. However, bunds carry an interest rate risk as rising German bond yields diminish the value of bonds held by investors. At the moment (11 November), they’re growing faster than inflation. Typically, bunds appreciate in interest as their maturity expands, reflecting the risk apparent in holding assets for longer. In late 2022, saw a rise amid a perceived high market risk. Inflation in Germany has risen rapidly as the country battles the fallout of jammed supply chains following the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The ( ) rose by 8.7% in February, 0.8% higher than in January. Meanwhile, the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices was 9.3%, 1.0% higher than the previous month. Germany, more than several of its compatriots, was heavily dependent on Russian energy prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – 55% of the country’s gas imports in 2021 came from Russia, according to the (WEF). By June 2022, that figure had declined to 26%. Inevitably, this added to a steep rise in costs. Energy product prices in February were up 19.1% year-over-year ( ). According to analysts, rising inflation also impacted German bonds. “The skyrocketing inflation trend in Germany is generating an earthquake for the Bund market,” Capital.com analyst Piero Cingari wrote in a note. This is because inflation has forced the European Central Bank ( ) – which has a 2% CPI target – to hike interest rates with , affecting borrowing for eurozone member states like Germany. The ECB increased its deposit facility by 75 bps consecutively and , and a further 50 bps in , and . Prior to the fall in March, 10-year German bonds appeared to be responding to the hikes, rising from 0.77% at the start of August to 2% on 10 November. However, the collapse of the two US banks seems to be costing bunds their status as a safe-haven asset. Germany is also coping with a steep budget deficit tied to both the Covid-19 stimulus and measures taken since Russia’s campaign against Ukraine began. The country recorded a , its biggest since German reunification in 1990, as it filled public coffers to accommodate aggressive lockdowns. This fell to a still substantial . Germany ran a deficit of , having amassed a €75.6bn deficit in the first half of 2021. As a result, a surging number of supply of bonds have been made available by the German government, which has perhaps helped keep rates lower than they would be otherwise. This is expected to escalate, with Germany planning to double borrowing to €45bn in 2023 to fight the effects of an energy shortfall, sources told Piero Cingari noted that this could affect the bond market outlook: According to , the 10-year German bond is forecast to hit 2.612% by the end of June 2023, an increase of 33.6 bp on current levels.

However, following the announcement, AMC share price fell over 15% on 15 March. Shareholders of the theatre chain voted to issue new shares of stock in the hope that it will inject the company with cash and save them from bankruptcy. The approval of the reverse stock split will now pave the way for the movie theatre chain to keep raising cash, whilst reducing its debt load through stock sales and ultimately increase its shareholder base. Preliminary results for APE conversion proposal passed with 978 million votes. The second proposal, which was the reverse split of the company's common shares at a ratio of 10:1, also passed by a similar majority. In 2022, AMC lost three-quarters of its stock value, as the company’s valuation was hit by a deterioration in macroeconomic conditions while senior management systematically diluted shareholdings by raising capital via the sale of a new class of shares called AMC Preferred Equity Units – also known as APEs. AMC stock news, as of 19 December, the company had $153.2 million worth of APEs to sanitize its balance sheet by using the proceeds to reduce its corporate debt. In late December, the firm the sale of another $110 million equity stake via the sale of more APE shares that will be purchased by a firm called Antara Capital LP at $0.66 per share. In addition, AMC Entertainment's Board of Directors is proposing an AMC reverse stock split and the conversion of APE shares into AMC common shares at a ratio of 1-for-1. As of 16 March 2023, AMC stock traded at $4.09, having shed close to 71% of its value over the past year. What does this AMC share split means for existing shareholders and how it can affect the AMC stock price? In this article, we provide further details about this corporate action and its implications. AMC Entertainment is one of the world’s largest movie theater chains. It was founded in 1920 by the Dubinsky brothers in Kansas City but has expanded its footprint to several countries. Its largest market by revenue is the United States. As of 16 March, AMC and operated 943 theatres worldwide and more than 10,000 available screens. Meanwhile, during the first nine months of the year, its venues attracted 151.38 million attendants and produced revenues of $2.92 billion. The US market is the most important for AMC as it accounted for approximately three-quarters of its revenues during these first nine months. The top two revenue segments for the firm are ticket sales and food and beverage with the second being the most profitable for AMC Entertainment. Adam Aron is AMC’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO). He has been at the helm since January 2016. The company employs over 25,000 people and is headquartered in Leawood, Kansas. AMC Entertainment became a in December 2013 when it sold its shares to the public at $18 apiece. AMC became part of the meme-stock trading frenzy in 2021. That new cash from retail investors pushed share prices as high as $72.62 in May of that year, but it ultimately wasn’t enough to lift the company’s fortunes. Since 2019, the value of AMC stock has dropped by over 70%. During this same period, the ( ) and the tech-heavy ( ) generated gains of 38% and 69% respectively. A is a corporate action that consists of increasing the number of common shares in circulation of a certain publicly traded entity. These newly issued shares are distributed among existing stockholders, meaning that the transaction does not have a dilutive effect Once the operation is completed, the price of each individual stock typically declines as the number of shares in circulation increases while the total value of the company’s equity remains unchanged. Corporations usually engaged in this type of operation to increase the liquidity of their shares in the open market as a lower price could attract retail investors with relatively low investment budgets. However, the introduction of innovative financial products such as contracts for difference ( ) and fractional shares have made it easier for investors who have a relatively small investment budget to buy shares of virtually any company without committing that much money. Another reason that may justify a stock split is that some may not be permitted to buy shares whose price is lower or higher than a certain threshold. Attracting those funds could be considered a good reason for splitting a stock. In the case of the above-mentioned AMC stock split, the Board is proposing a reverse stock split. This operation involves the opposite of a regular split as it will eliminate a certain number of shares to increase the price of the stock. This typically occurs if a firm needs to maintain the price of its common shares above a certain threshold to comply with the minimum requirements of the exchange where they are listed. The AMC stock split that the Board is proposing is a 10:1 reverse split, meaning that stockholders will end up owning one common share for every ten they previously held. According to data from and other similar financial data providers, an AMC stock split has not occurred since the company went public in 2013. This means that, if approved, the Board’s proposed 10-for-1 reverse stock split will be the first of its kind in the history of the company. As of 14 March 2023, investors have approved a 1-for-10 reverse stock split and plans to increase the total number of shares. The approval will enable AMC to convert a series of recently issued preferred shares, APE, into common stock. On 14 March, CEO Adam Aron said: Aron also said that the APE conversion vote will eliminate the gap between the value of AMC shares and the preferred dividend, which has hampered the company’s efforts to sell stock. As well as its declining share price, AMC has a further hurdle to overcome and that will be concerning its court hearing on 27 April at Delaware Chancery Court. The hearing relates to a class-action lawsuit by disgruntled shareholders that were originally against the issuance of the APE preferred stock. Eric Wold, analysts at B. Riley securities believes it will be difficult for the Delaware judge to oversee upcoming the class-action lawsuit and rule against the validity of the vote, given the fact that the majority of shareholders voted for it to proceed. Wold continues to view a positive path for AMC to raise capital, repair its balance sheet and also chase M&A opportunities but Wold maintains a ‘neutral’ recommendation and $4.50 price target until final approval has been given. According to data from , the consensus recommendation from analysts for AMC Entertainment stock was “reduce”, based on 4 analysts ratings, a consensus analysts price target of $3.12, which is a downside of over 26%. CNN finance said the 5 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc have a median target of 2.00, with a high estimate of 4.50 and a low estimate of 0.50. The median estimate represents a -52.49% decrease from the last price of 4.21. On 29 December, analysts from Wedbush Securities : The majority of AMC Entertainment shares are in the hands of retail investors as indicated by data from . Only 29.75% of the company’s stock float is in the hands of institutional investors as of 4 January. The consensus recommendation for AMC Entertainment stock (AMC) as of 4 January was \"hold\" based on the opinion of 4 analysts as indicated by data compiled by . However, analysts can and do get their predictions and stock price targets wrong. Always do your own research before trading or investing. And never trade more than you can afford to lose. The highest 12-month prediction from analysts according to data from stood at $8.5 per share. This implies an upside potential of more than 100% in the near term. This should not be considered a recommendation to buy AMC stock. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Always do your own research before trading or investing, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

What does it mean for financial markets? In this article, we take a look at the latest Silicon Valley Bank news, and try to explain what the institution did, why it collapsed, and what are the companies affected. Silicon Valley Bank was set up in 1983 by former Bank of America ( ) managers Bill Biggerstaff and Robert Medearis and was based in San Jose, California. The company was designed, as its name suggested, to serve the needs of tech companies at a time when the market for computers was still, if not in its infancy, then in a fairly early part of its overall development. The organisation grew and grew, opening offices across the US. During the 1990s, it moved its headquarters to the Californian city of Santa Clara, and was able to profit from the , as it became noted for its willingness to lend money to start-up companies that were not yet turning a profit. Although the bubble burst, sending the Silicon Valley Bank stock price dropping by around half, by 2002, under the leadership of CEO Ken Wilcox, it entered the private banking sphere and two years later it opened offices in the UK, India, Israel and China. By 2015, the bank said that it funded around 65% of all tech start-ups in the US and, despite the arrest and subsequent jailing of former vice president Mounir Gad on insider trading charges, the company looked like it was maintaining its position as the main place for new businesses in the tech sector to do their banking. Things started to go wrong in 2022. While the previous few years had been pretty good for the tech industry as people relied more on online companies during Covid-19 lockdowns, the companies who had been banking with SVB had seen their deposits invested in . Normally this would be seen as a pretty safe and reliable investment, but rose in 2022 to combat the worldwide cost of living crisis. This meant that the overall value of the bonds went down. In turn, this caused some businesses to worry about the overall security of their deposits with SVB, which led to them withdrawing their money. As a result of this, SVB had to try and sell its bonds so it would have enough money to satisfy the needs of the companies and people who had invested in it, which was announced on 8 March 2022. This news, in turn, caused more organisations to try to withdraw their funds. Just two days after the bank, which had been worth $200bn, announced it would be trying to sell its bonds, SVB collapsed. Banking regulators in California closed the bank and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as the receiver. In a , the FDIC said: Following the news, the SVBI share price crashed by 60.41% on 10 March, before the trading halt was announced on the as investors await further developments. The collapse of SVB has had an impact on a variety of companies including the wider banking sector and SBV clients. The stocks affected included streaming firm Roku ( ), which saw its stock price drop 3% over the weekend amid claims that SVB held more than a quarter of the company’s assets, arts e-commerce site Etsy ( ), whose price fell by more than 6% across 13 March after its merchants were told there may be a delay in accessing their deposits. The AI semiconductor business Ambarella ( ), saw its share price fall by around 6% from 10 to 13 March as it had a reported $17m worth of deposits in SVB. The collapse of SVB has had an impact on a variety of companies which banked with it. For instance, Lindsay Michaelides, the CEO of Strongsuit, a company designed to support working parents, tweeted that her business’s financial future was at risk following what happened to SVB. Hi, I’m Lindsey. A bit about me: - Ohio mother of 4 - I employ a team of 15 as a start-up founder & CEO of Strongsuit - drive a used Honda Odessey - husband works in manufacturing - The financial future of my company, team and family are at risk w/ the collapse of SVB (1/23) Garry Tan of Y Combinator that the collapse could represent an “extinction level event” for newer and smaller tech companies. The banking sector was also hit following the news about SVB. A number of regional bank stocks were down over the wake of the collapse, with Western Alliance Bancorp’s stock price dropping more than 85% from an intraday high of $55.96 on 10 March to an intraday low of $7.56 on 13 March. At the time of writing, the stock is trading 48% down on the day. Meanwhile, First Republic Bank (FRC), dropped from an intraday high of $95.44 on 10 March to an intraday low of $17.55 on 13 March, an over 80% slump. Bigger banks were also hit, yet on a smaller scale, with Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America ( ) seeing 4% and 2% falls in their share prices respectively on 13 March. The matter was not restricted to American markets, either, as the FTSE 100 (UK100) was down, with banking giants Standard Chartered ( ), which dropped over 6% on 13 March, and Barclays ( ), which fell over 5%. Meanwhile, investors appeared to be looking to move their money into so-called , with the price of gold rising 2.2% following SVB’s collapse. Rupert Thompson, the Chief Economist at Kingswood, said that, while the collapse of SVB was the largest bank collapse since the , things were somewhat different. He explained: “Silicon Valley Bank was very much focused on tech start-ups and ran into problems as the rise in interest rates had led to deposit withdrawals and was forcing it to sell its government bond holdings at a loss.” It is possible that interest rates, which have risen significantly in the US, could be calmed down if there are fears that other, larger, banks could suffer the same fate as SVB for similar reasons. Likewise, traders could see the overall stock prices of both banks and tech companies slow in growth or even fall, at least in the short-term. There may also be implications for the US dollar, with the US Dollar Index ( ) dropping between 10 and 13 March.

Silicon Valley Bank collapsed as it experienced a run after announcing that it was in the process of selling bonds it held. Silicon Valley Bank collapsed because it had to sell the bonds it held in order to support customers who wanted to withdraw their deposits after the news that, following a series of interest rate hikes, the bonds were not worth as much as they had been. Silicon Valley Bank’s parent company, SVB Financial Group, is publicly traded under the ticker handle SIVB. Silicon Valley Bank was owned by SVB Financial Group, although at the time of writing its various arms were potentially being sold off, with HSBC buying its UK arm for £1 on 13 March 2023. SVB’s American operation is now in the hands of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation who are acting as the receiver.

Swiss regulators also confirmed that the owners of $17bn worth of \"additional tier one\" bonds, which are a risker class of debt, will lose everything. This means that Swiss families who have invested millions in Credit Suisse will be removed without a say. Credit Suisse shareholders will receice the equivalent of just 0.76 Swiss francs in UBS shares for stock that was worth 1.86 Swiss francs on 17 March. “We welcome the announcements by the Swiss authorities today to support financial stability,” said US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in a joint statement.

The closely-watched index has since rebounded 17.6% to trade at 33,793.59 as of 10 February 2023. So, what will happen next? Will the US30 Index continue its current trend or will the losses of 2022 be repeated this year? In this Dow Jones forecast, we look at the recent performance, see how it compares with other US indices, and reveal what analysts predict for the coming months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), also known as the Dow, is a that tracks 30 of the most prominent, actively traded companies in the US. The index is one of the oldest and most popular in the world, dating back to the late 1800s. It was created and named after Charles Dow, an American journalist who also co-founded The Wall Street Journal, in order to provide investors with information about stock activity. The Dow originally consisted of 12 companies, which were some of the biggest stocks of the 1890s, and mainly manufacturers of raw material. These included American Cotton Oil, American Sugar, American Tobacco. In 1928, it expanded to 30 companies and today contains some of the most prominent companies, such as tech giant Apple ( ) and beverage corporation Coca-Cola ( ). The index spent much of 2022 below 34,000 points as multiple interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve ( ) raised concerns about a possible in the US. Although it started the year well at 36,321.59, it hit a downtrend that saw it fall to 32,272.64 on 24 February. Though the US30 rebounded in the spring, trading at a high of 35,372.26 on 28 March, by June it had lost all its gains as it fell below the 30,000 mark for the first time that year. It would trend upwards once again toward late summer, reaching 34,281.36 on 16 August, but this was followed by a downward slide that saw the index reach its lowest point of the year in September. However, the end of the year brought a more positive turn as the Dow closed at 33,147.25, having hiked 15% from its 2022 low, but fallen 8% during the year. As of 10 February 2023, the index was up a modest 2%, having so far avoided much of the volatility it witnessed the previous year. Of course, the Dow wasn’t alone when it came to being affected by economic issues. In fact, it hel up better than other US markets. For example, the S&P 500 ( ), Wall Street’s dropped by almost 20%, in 2022. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ), meanwhile, plummeted by 33% last year. However, major US stock indices show signs of optimism so far this year, with the S&P 500 up almost 7% year-to-date ( ), and the Nasdaq 100 up close to 13%. In an analysis from 5 January, Goldman Sachs’ chief US economist David Mericle believed it was possible for the country to avoid a recession in 2023. “Our probability of a recession over the next 12 months stands at 35%. “Part of our disagreement with consensus arises from our more optimistic view on whether a recession is necessary to tame inflation. We think that a continued period of below-potential growth can gradually rebalance supply and demand in the labor market and dampen wage and price pressures with a much more limited increase in the unemployment rate than historical relationships would suggest.” Daniel Hathorn, senior market analyst at Capital.com, believed achieve a soft landing would be the key theme behind the performance of US stock indices in 2023. However, she believed this was in contrasted to the markets expectations, which seemed to be for a hard landing scenario. “They’re expecting data to worsen from here on out, and for the Fed to have no other option but to start cutting rates in 2023.” What is the Dow Jones forecast for 2023? As of 10 February, the predicted the index could trade at 33,634 points by March 2023 — the maximum value of the index was expected to be 35,652, and the potential minimum was outlined at 31,616. The Dow Jones prediction for February 2024 was 33,232 points, according to the EFA. While the maximum value could be 35,226 points, the minimum was expected to be 31,238 points. Meanwhile, it saw the index potentially closing at 34,900 in February 2025. According to , the US30 Index was expected to move down to trade at 32,813.24 points by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Looking forward, the forecasting service suggested the index could drop to 29,688.65 in 12 months. believed that the Dow could be a “not so good long-term (1-year) investment”, expecting the index to plunge to 28,738.84 in a year. The website’s forecast, however, had not been updated in several weeks due to “missing data or revoked stock”. Its Dow Jones forecast 2025 suggested the US30 could rebound and trade at 29,351.91 by the end of February. None of the forecasting tools provided a Dow Jones forecast for 2030. A lot will depend on the economic environment. The current expectation seems to be that inflation could remain high over the coming months, necessitating further interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. No one knows for sure. Economists haven’t ruled out a bounce for equities and the US30 index contains some household names that are often in demand from investors. However, analysts' predictions can go wrong. You can always conduct your own research before making any trading decision. Companies on the Dow Jones index are some of the largest, most prominent US stocks. However, the index has been in a downtrend lately and lost 15.88% year-to-date by the close on 30 June 2022 amid recession fears and other macroeconomic headwinds.

From 120,000 EVs sold in 2011, the number jumped to 6.6 million in 2021, representing 10% of the total car sales, according to data from International Energy Agency (IEA). In 2022, 4.3 million new EVs were sold during the first half-year – a 62% increase compared to 2021, according to What are the and how many cars do they sell every year?

We will be ranking each manufacturer by , so only publicly traded firms will be included. The market cap data was sourced from as of 22 February 2023. The companies that make up our list are pure-play EV firms, meaning that they do not produce fossil fuel-powered cars, such as, for example, Toyota ( ) or Hyundai (HYMTF). Tesla ( ) is the undisputed leader among the biggest electric car companies by market capitalisation. The EV giant produced over 439,000 and delivered over 405,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2022. In 2022, its deliveries were 1.31 million while production increased to 1.37 million, according to the firm’s latest .

The Air has a range of 520 miles and offers the largest “frunk” in the market – or so the company says. A frunk is the frontal trunk of an EV. In , the firm produced 7,180 vehicles and delivered 4,369 vehicles. NIO ( ) is next on our list of top electric car companies.

NIO’s primary manufacturing facility is in the Hefei Economic and Technological Development Area (HETA) in China. The firm’s CEO is William Li. By the end of 2021, Nio employed 15,204 full-time workers, the majority of which were based in China. Rivian ( ) was founded in 2015 and is headquartered in Irvine, California. The firm’s CEO Robert J. Scaringe is also the company’s founder. The firm made headlines in November 2021 when it debuted on the , valued at over $100bn.

Leapmotor (9863.HK) – $4.01bn #9. Fisker (FSR) – $2.01bn #10. Nikola Corporation (NKLA) – $1.18bn The EV market is still a relatively small segment of the massive auto industry and companies within it are competing to position their products and technologies. As of the time of writing, Tesla remained the winner. The EV firm has scaled up operations rapidly, and its products have proven reliable in terms of performance, autonomy and technological advancement. It’s yet to be seen which one of the firms will be Tesla's biggest competitor. However, now that many of these companies have started delivering their first working vehicles, it’s only a matter of time before the best-performing EV firms start to shine.

What is a realistic Nasdaq 100 forecast as the Fed potentially adjusts its monetary policy approach? In this article, we look at the latest Nasdaq 100 news, drivers for the index’s value and forecasts for how it might perform for the rest of the year and beyond. The Nasdaq 100, also known as the NDX and , is a composite index of 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on their market capitalisation. As of 9 December, the index’s biggest 10 components were: 1 Apple AAPL $2.25trn 2 Microsoft MSFT $1.83trn 3 Alphabet Class A GOOGL $1.22trn 4 Alphabet Class C GOOG $1.21trn 5 Amazon AMZN $915.60bn 6 Tesla TSLA $556.90bn 7 Meta Platforms META $304.31bn 8 PepsiCo PEP $253.66bn 9 ASML Holding ASML $248.78bn 10 Broadcom AVGO $222bn The US100 is synonymous with technology stocks, which account for 55.4% of its component companies. It also contains stocks in the consumer discretionary, healthcare, consumer staples, industrials and telecommunications sectors. You can trade the Nasdaq 100 using mutual or exchange-traded funds ( ) as well as , , annuities and contracts for difference ( ). The value of exchange-traded products ( ) tracking the index exceeded $300bn at the end of 2021. The changes as the share prices of its component stocks fluctuate in response to global economic growth, digitalisation, technological innovation, financial performance and investor sentiment. As the NDX is weighted, a sharp movement in the share price of one of the larger components can result in a large move in the index’s value. The growth in the value of the Nasdaq spiked in 2020 as technology and consumer stocks benefited from the acceleration in the transition to ecommerce during Covid-19 lockdowns. In October 2020, a survey by consulting firm McKinsey found that the crisis accelerated digitalisation by several years. Over the past five years, the Nasdaq 100 has gained 79.97%, compared with a 48.12% gain in the S&P 500 Index ( ). The NDX peaked at 16,764.86 points in November 2021 and has since been in a downward trend. It started 2022 at 16,501.77, and dropped to the 14,000 mark by the end of January. Its value fell further to 13,500 by late February as bearish sentiment gained traction with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The index was down at 13,046 by mid-March. A late March rally to 15,239 could not be sustained as the Fed tapered off its asset-buying programme that had provided support to the markets during the pandemic and began raising interest rates. The Fed raised its target federal funds rate by 25 basis points ( ) on 17 March to 0.25-0.50%, and by another 50 bps on 5 May to 0.75-1%. The NDX plunged to 11,257.57 on 16 June, its lowest level since October 2020, as the Fed raised the rate by 75 bps to 1.5%-1.75%. Two more 75-bp hikes followed on 28 July and 22 September, bringing the target range to 3%-3.25%. The Nasdaq 100 trend turned higher over the summer as economic data had investors anticipating that the Fed would begin to slow the pace of hikes. The index reached 13,667.18 on 15 August. However, high inflation data released in August tempered hopes that the Fed would slow down the pace of hikes, and the market turned lower again. The index reached a 52-week low of 10,440.64 in October, after the third consecutive 75 point hike on 22 September. The US dollar has weakened since October. The annual inflation rate to 7.7%, accelerating its retreat from the June high of 9.1%, after coming in at 8.5% in July, 8.3% in August and 8.2% in September. This has fuelled market expectations that the Fed could soften its approach to interest rates, following a fourth 75 point hike on 3 November. The index has rebounded above the 11,000 level, rising from 10,797.55 ahead of the inflation announcement to 11.637.50 at the close on 8 December. What does that mean for the Nasdaq outlook for the near term and into 2023? Let’s look at some of the latest Nasdaq 100 predictions. Stock market analysts are cautious on the outlook given the indications from the Federal Reserve that interest rates will continue to rise. “Ultimately, the degree of inflation moderation ahead, in turn Fed policy, and how much damage will be inflicted on the economy (to bring inflation under control) will remain the primary influences on earnings and multiples in our view,” according to analysis by US investment bank . “We do believe that we are in the late stages of this bear market, due to our belief that inflation is set to moderate over the next year and that the recession will be mild. However, the Fed remains in tightening mode, tightening acts with a lag on the economy, and it will likely take time for the Fed and investors to have high conviction on the inflationary and economic outlook- resulting in more time needed before equities are able to show sustainable upside in our view. “The bank’s analysts “maintain our overall stance to refrain from chasing the rally periods and to build exposure in the weak periods,” and note that “Technology earnings estimates are getting revised downward at a quicker pace than the S&P 500, which is a headwind for sector performance.” The Nasdaq 100 forecast for 2023 from algorithm-based forecasting service at the time of writing (9 December) indicated that the index had bottomed out and could rise from 12,015.64 points at the start of the year to 13,649.05 by the end of the year. The service’s Nasdaq 100 forecast for 2025 estimated that the index could climb to 17,012.37, up from 15,341.90 at the end of 2024. ’s five-year projection showed the index at 20,011.15, indicating a bullish Nasdaq 100 forecast for 2030 at new all-time highs. However, the long-term Nasdaq 100 forecast from was bearish, predicting that the index could drop to 9,301 points at the end of 2023 from 10,981 at the end of 2022 and 11766 in March 2023. The index could then move up to 10,998 by the end of 2024, the data showed. A US100 forecast from estimated that the index could fall from 11,605.65 at the end of 2022 to 10,513.73 in one year, based on global macro model projections and analysts’ expectations. When evaluating any Nasdaq 100 forecast to inform your trading, it’s important to keep in mind that unexpected geopolitical events and government announcements can drive market volatility, making it difficult for analysts and algorithm-based forecasters to come up with accurate long-term predictions. If you’re interested in investing in the Nasdaq 100, look at the latest market trends, news, technical and fundamental US tech 100 analysis, and expert opinion before making any investment decision. Keep in mind that past performance is no guarantee of future returns. And never invest money you cannot afford to lose. Over the long term, the Nasdaq 100 Index has gained value and outperformed the S&P 500, but investors should be aware that past performance is no guarantee of future returns. Whether the index is a good investment for you depends on your personal financial goals, portfolio composition and risk tolerance, among other factors. Always make sure to do your own research. And never invest money you cannot afford to lose. The direction of the NDX could depend on the performance of its constituent company stocks, based on their financial performance, macroeconomic factors and monetary policy in the US and major markets, among other factors. The busiest time for the is around the release of key US economic announcements such as trade data, inflation and interest rates, as well as major world events that can affect investor sentiment and drive price volatility. Remember that high volatility can increase the risk of losses. You should make trading decisions after performing your own research. Whether you invest in the Nasdaq 100 Index or any other asset is a personal decision you should take depending on your risk tolerance and investing strategy.

The index plunged to 1,013.89 on 16 March. The index started to climb back as the Fed stepped in with loosening and the government launched economic packages to rescue the economy.

In 2023, the RTY index managed to recover some losses, rising over 10% year-to-date in line with the wider stock markets, as the Fed slowed interest rate hikes to 25 basis points ( ) in February. News on macroeconomic headwinds have been the main factor driving equity markets. Small-cap stocks tend to rally when the economy is growing. On the other hand, economic pessimism and fears of recession hurt investor sentiment on small-caps. When a increases its key , it typically affects other rates such as mortgage and loan rates. High interest rates would increase borrowing costs for companies, affecting their earnings. Higher borrowing costs could also encourage companies to slow spending for expansion. The US Fed hiked rates seven times in 2022 to combate multi-decade high inflation, bringing the federal funds rate to 4.25% to 4.50% by the end of the year. Although the central bank has slowed the hiking speed lately, raising the rate by 25bps in the February 2023 meeting, the damage has been done. Over 40% of Russell 2000 companies were already unprofitable in 2022, according to a Morgan Stanley report. The key risk on the downside is that higher borrowing costs and weaker demand may continue to hurt small businesses included in the RTY index. There are a LOT of unprofitable companies in the Russell 2000 that are dependent on for survival. Be careful what you own. When will the Fed pivot its key rate remains the billion-dollar question.

As key standouts, on Tuesday we’ll see US CPI at 1.30 PM GMT, followed by UK CPI and PPI at 7 AM GMT on Wednesday, and US CPI and PPI on Thursday at 1.30 PM. The feeling I get from looking at equity markets is that traders are still confused as to where to place their expectations on what 2023 will entail for economic growth. The US is used as a generalised benchmark for risk appetite and the key equity indices have been dropping over the past few days despite an attempted upward reversal on Tuesday. Essentially, this move lower follows on from the higher-than-expected jobs data seen last Friday, which spooked those hoping for a more dovish Fed in the coming months. As I mentioned in a note I posted on Wednesday: I still stand by this and believe that traders feel pretty lost and need further clarification for any further momentum to be achieved. As can be seen in the chart below, retail traders are feeling positive about the stock market, which can be taken to understand that they expect the inflation data to fall in line with the softer economic growth scenario, which has been the key driver of bullish equity markets for the past 4 months. Take the resurgence of meme stocks as an indicator of investors trying to find bargains. Because of this, there is a greater risk of a positive surprise in the data, where we see a higher-than-expected reading, and equities may take a bit of a dive. On the charts, both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are holding above their 2022 descending trend lines and their 200-day SMAs but they have failed to make a breakout above last week’s highs and are now building on the bearish momentum with lower highs and lows. The S&P 500 is nearing its 20-day SMA (4050 - green line) which might offer some support as we saw back at the beginning of January but a further drop below 4000 cannot be discarded as the RSI dips below 50. Beyond here we find the 50-day SMA (3965 - black line) followed by the descending trend line at 3929. The Nasdaq still has a way to go before reaching its 20-day SMA (12058) but it hasn't been as good as a support in the past few months so it may provide little relief for buyers. The RSI is also holding a little bit steadier so we may see a further pullback towards the 200-day SMA (11898 - yellow line) before stronger support comes in. In Europe, the DAX 40 is also feeling the effects of the selloff but is still holding a better formation than US equities. The move higher has consolidated slightly over the past few days, finding resistance just above 15600 but it continues to trade comfortably above its key support range (15000 - 14813) where I expect to see another halt in the pullback and potentially some sideways consolidation. The FTSE 100 has been a little less resilient than its German counterpart but is also holding relatively well to the gains seen over the past few months. The 20-day SMA has moved up towards 7817 which is offering some support to buyers but I wouldn’t be surprised if we see a dip below 7800 in the case that bearish pressure intensifies, with further support around 7710. Focus on the US CPI to provide further guidance on the economy There is likely to be some support at the key range (15000 - 14813) Related topics Rate this article Rate this article: Most traded Join the 610,000+ traders worldwide that chose to trade with Capital.com Contact us: CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs.

The overall feeling heading into this reporting season is that of weakness in growth, and therefore expectations have been set pretty low. One industry that has struggled the most in 2022 is the tech sector, with the Nasdaq composite dropping over 17% in the year after a stellar performance in 2021. Interest rate rises, soaring inflation, and a stronger US dollar have contributed to US stocks' weakness throughout 2022. But companies have been cutting costs to preserve their margins and so with lower costs and demand proving resilient, there is a strong chance that we see better-than-expected results from a few of the big names. w/c 16/01 w/c 23/01 w/c 30/01 Netflix beat estimates on earnings and revenue in Q3 after adding 2.4 million subscribers in the quarter, a significant rise on the 1 million anticipated. As the world’s leading online streaming platform the number of subscribers is a key metric of its performance and something investors keep a close eye on. Netflix’s earnings still declined 2.8% year-over-year to $3.10 but that was expected given the change in the covid-19 landscape which saw most restrictions to mobility lifted, and this was apparent in the performance of the stock, which jumped over 16%. During the earnings call, the chief financial officer, Spencer Neumann, said that despite building momentum the company was still . Some of the key headwinds for Netflix have been a sluggish economy, increased competition, and password sharing. On this last point, one of the key takeaways from the earnings call was the intention to crack down on password-sharing in 2023. As mentioned earlier, the bar has been set pretty low for this earnings season so it's likely that we see a good amount of positive surprises that will engage positive momentum in the market. The improved fundamental outlook will have likely helped Netflix in Q4, alongside a weaker US dollar, which was one of the headwinds in Q3. The online streamer is also expected to see a small boost from its new advertising business as it gradually grows its membership base, allowing for more revenue and improved margins. The content offer is also expected to have captured new subscribers amidst a highly competitive landscape. The consensus forecast for its Q4 earnings is around $0.57 per share, a 58% drop from the $1.33 reported a year ago, and an 82% drop from the previous quarter. Meanwhile, earnings are expected to have grown 1.5% to $7.8B from a year ago. As usual, one of the key metrics investors will be monitoring closely is , with Q4 estimates at 4.5 million new subscribers. One of the key efforts to increase this number is the crackdown on password sharing which will force people who have been borrowing accounts to create their own. But given this is mostly expected to take effect in 2023, the Q4 subscriber growth will have benefitted from the launch of the basic plan in November, which is an that allows viewers to enjoy their content at a lower monthly rate with around 5 minutes of ads per hour of content. Netflix shares have been steadily rising in the first weeks of 2023 as the general market sentiment improves. The stock managed to break away from its sideways consolidation back in October when the Q3 earnings showed better-than-expect EPS and revenue. The current price is edging towards the December highs at $330 where buyers are encountering some resistance, but a better-than expect-result on Thursday is likely to provide the momentum for another bounce higher and edge towards $400.

Shares of the online retail giant saw a boost in the first week of the new year as the layoff plans were announced, a sign of relief from investors. The reality is that after a decade of cheap money and a booming tech industry in the aftermath of the covid-19 pandemic, we’ve come to a time where cost-cutting is going to be the norm for a few years as companies attempt to save their profit margins. After a strong boost on the back of remote working and studying during the pandemic, the demand for cloud services has dropped over the last 9 months, as has the need to rely on online retailers. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is expected to have slowed its growth in 2022 after a stellar performance in 2021 as many companies slow their migration to the cloud, but Q4 is still expected to show a 20% increase from the previous quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to be 14% higher than in the previous 3 months as inflation pushes up the price of goods. But with the costs of these goods rising proportionately, the gross profit margin for the quarter is expected to drop from 44.7% to 41.6%, evidencing the drop in online retail demand. I expect investors will be particularly focused on the company’s forecasts for Q1 2023 as consumer spending continues to slow. The recent rally in AMZN has found some resistance just below the $100 mark (99.32) which is likely to remain a key area targeted by sellers heading into the earnings release next week. Being there, the areas between 103.77 and 104.95 was key in stopping buyers from recovering the losses seen in October/November last year, so likely another area to focus on. The RSI has been breaking to new highs throughout January but the price has failed to catch up, sitting below the highs seen on November 15th meaning the move higher has been exhausted. For the path of least resistance to be on the upside we would need to see the RSI break above the high on January 13th at the same time the stock price moves past 99.32.

Can its fortunes turn around? The US financial services company, which facilitates commission-free trades via a mobile app, has seen falling user activity in a challenging economic environment. It cited the “broad crypto market crash” and the deterioration of the macro environment as contributory reasons for a recent reduction in its headcount. However, analysts believe has the potential to rise by almost 40% over the coming year, especially if there is an increase in cryptocurrency trading numbers. In our HOOD stock forecast we take a look at the company’s recent results, examine the performance of its stock, and consider the longer term Robinhood stock predictions of analysts. Robinhood is a US-based financial services firm that facilitates commission-free trades of stocks, exchange traded funds and cryptocurrencies via a mobile app. It was founded in April 2013 by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, with their being to “democratise finance for all”. The company generates its revenue through sources such as market makers and trading venues, margin interest, income generated from cash and general cash management. It also makes money from selling Robinhood Gold subscriptions, which give investors access to a suite of tools, data and features. Any Robinhood share price forecast needs to consider how it has been performing in recent years – and this doesn’t make great reading for investors. Robinhood went public on the Nasdaq on 29 July 2021 at $38. After dropping as much as 12% at one point, the stock finished its first day down 8% at around $34.82. The surged to a record intraday high of $85 on 4 August, before tumbling to close the next trading day at $50.97. Its all-time high stock closing price of $70.39 was achieved on 4 August 2021. Its performance since then has been volatile. At market close on 30 November 2022, the Robinhood stock price was down to $9.59 – 86% lower than its all-time high and 48% lower than the start of this year. There have been a number of contributory factors behind the struggling stock price. For example, while came in at $365m in the third quarter of 2021, they were down to $361m for the corresponding period this year. Similarly, while Robinhood achieved total net revenues of $978m for the nine months ended 30 September 2022, this was 33% down on the $1.45bn achieved over the same period in 2021. Robinhood has also felt the effects of the worsening global economic environment, which has helped trigger a wave of cost-cutting in recent months. In a published in August, Vlad Tenev, Robinhood’s co-founder and CEO, announced the company was reducing its headcount by approximately 23%. While all areas could be affected, the changes would be “particularly concentrated” in the operations, marketing and program management functions. The CEO also acknowledged its “mandate to drive greater cost discipline and accountability” had made it clear that changes are needed to the company’s organisational structure. What is the latest news that could affect the Robinhood stock forecast? BlockFi, the bankrupt cryptocurrency lender, is suing FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried in an attempt to seize his shares in Robinhood, according to filed in New Jersey, US. The action alleges Bankman-Fried pledged the shares as collateral before his exchange collapsed last month. Bankman-Fried’s Emergent Fidelity Technologies vehicle bought a 7.6% stake in Robinhood earlier this year. Bankman-Fried has been in the firing line since the collapse of FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange that was founded in 2019 and once had around one million users. In an at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit, he told the paper’s Andrew Ross Sorkin that huge management failures and sloppy accounting were to blame. In early November, 2022, the company announced . While revenues were down in comparison to the same period last year, there was some positive news. Total net revenue was $361m – a 14% sequential increase over the second quarter. It also reported a 3% sequential rise in transaction-based revenues to $208m, with options up 10% at $124m and equities rising 7% to $31m. However, cryptocurrencies decreased 12% to $51m. Overall, the company had a net loss of $175m, compared to a net loss of $295m in the second quarter, which represented a sequential improvement of $120m. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ( , non- ) came in at $47m, which was a sequential improvement of $127m. According to Tenev, the goal of reaching positive adjusted EBITDA was achieved a quarter earlier than planned: Jason Warnick, the company’s CFO, said the figures had been achieved due to increasing revenues and reducing expenses: So, what are the Robinhood stock predictions of analysts? As of 1 December, the stock was a ‘hold’ based on the views of 13 analysts compiled by , although opinions are clearly divided. Five see it as a ‘buy’, while four each have ‘hold’ and ‘sell’ recommendations. Their consensus HOOD stock forecast was that it could hit $13.36, which would represent a potential upside of 39.28% over the $9.59 closing price on 20 November, 2022. The highest Robinhood stock forecast 2023 prediction came in at $28 and the lowest warned it could slip to just $7. HOOD stock was also a ‘hold’, according to the Robinhood stock forecast views of nine analysts compiled by , although this isn’t a unanimous opinion. Three analysts have it down as a ‘buy’, four as a ‘hold’ and two as a ‘sell’. In recent weeks, analyst Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank has reiterated his ‘hold’ recommendation, along with a $9 price target. Benjamin Budish of Barclays, meanwhile, sees the stock as a ‘sell’, while Dan Dolev of Mizuho Securities has a ‘buy’ recommendation and a $14 price target. Looking further afield, the Robinhood stock forecast 2025 from , the algorithmic forecaster, has the stock down at $3.18 by December 2025. Please keep in mind that analysts’ predictions can be wrong. Forecasts shouldn’t be used as a substitute for your own research. Always conduct your own due diligence before trading. And never invest or trade money you cannot afford to lose.

You’ll also need to carry out your own research into the company and its industry to gauge whether it’s attractive. Always conduct your own due diligence before trading, looking at the latest news, a wide range of commentary, technical and fundamental analysis. Remember, past performance does not guarantee future returns. And never trade money you cannot afford to lose. No-one knows for sure. As of 1 December, the consensus view of 13 analysts compiled by MarketBeat is that it could hit $13.36. This represents a potential upside of 39.28% over the $9.59 closing price on 20 November, 2022. The highest prediction was $28 and the lowest came in at just $7. However, these predictions could be inaccurate. Always do your own research before making any investment decisions. Remember to never invest or trade with more money than you can afford to lose. Whether Robinhood is the right stock for you depends on your trading objectives. It’s important to do your own research. Your decision to trade depends on your attitude to risk, your expertise in the market, the spread of your portfolio and how comfortable you feel about losing money. You should never trade more than you can afford to lose.

The consensus among analysts is that the tech giant will report a 2.4% rise in revenue at $52.96bln, marking the slowest pace in roughly 6 years, while profit is expected to fall as much as 9% to $2.30. Sentiment around the tech space heading into this earning season has been downbeat and likely exacerbated by the wave of layoffs amid slowing sales growth. This also includes Microsoft who recently announced that they will cut 10,000 jobs, working out to be just under 5% of its workforce. In turn, the company will take a $1.2bln charge on its earnings. What’s more, Microsoft’s cloud computing business segment will be closely watched after last quarter saw Azure’s growth slowing to 35% from 50% a year prior. The expectation is for a continued slowing in digital spending given higher interest rates and cuts to corporate spending. That being said, among the main focal points will be the outlook regarding disruptive AI technology such as OpenAI, which could be the next big catalyst for the company. The tech giant is reportedly planning to invest $10bln in OpenAI, which will see Microsoft get a 75% share of profits until it makes a full return on its investment, after which the company would receive a 49% stake. Currently, google derives around 55-60% of its quarterly revenue ($69-70bln) from search alone, which naturally has increased the scrutiny as to whether OpenAI is a material threat to Google’s core business. However, with the cost to run ChatGPT per query much more expensive than Google, the threat is not imminent. On the technical front, risks remain titled to the downside for Microsoft shares given that the 200MDA has failed to crack the 200DMA (256.64). At the same time and perhaps more importantly, Microsoft continues to hold the 200WMA. A level that has not been notably breached/closed below since 2011. The trend remains lower and thus this area will be key as a close below could somewhat accelerate weakness.

The decision was made to face the changing economic environment the company is facing as higher interest rates and inflation take their toll. There had been a hiring spree since Covid-19 as the company experienced a period of rapid growth but in the memo released on Friday Sundar Pichai, Alphabet’s CEO since 2019, said the decision to hire up until last year was made for a different economic reality and that it would reengineer its workforce to focus on their highest priorities. The reaction in the stock price evidenced that investors saw this as a step in the right direction. Was the decision unexpected? Not at all. Alphabet is the latest on a list of tech companies (including Meta and Microsoft) to announce massive layoffs in the last few months as the industry faces a challenging economic outlook. One could say from the market reaction that investors were waiting for this to happen and were actually relieved when it did. The bulk of its revenue is derived from its google advertising services, which is expected to come in at $61.56bln for the fourth quarter. This means it is forecasted to be $7bln more than in Q3 but we may see how companies cut their advertising budgets amidst slowing consumer demand and recession concerns, meaning we may see a slight miss on this figure which would likely see some disappointment in the share price. Nonetheless, even if advertising revenue comes in line or beats expectations, investors will want to know more about what the company expects in the next few quarters. As with Microsoft, one of the focal points of the earnings call will be the update on the outlook regarding the AI investment. In fact, in the memo released on Friday when the job cuts were announced, Pichai mentioned their early investment in AI as one of the high opportunities going forward. But there is increased competition, most notably from Microsoft’s intention to increase its stake in OpenAI. Alphabet’s share price (GOOGL) is heading into its third week of gains after pushing away from its 2023 low (84.86 ) marked in the first few trading days. The bearish move in December was a continuation of the momentum seen throughout most of 2022 but it failed to break the yearly lows seen at the beginning of November (83.34) which consolidate the momentum for a reversal. Up ahead we can find resistance around 102.24 and we may see some consolidation around this area, as we did in March 2021, before moving higher. This is also where the bullish momentum got halted back in November. The price-to-earnings ratio is currently at 20 which is below its average, even after the Covid-19 price drop, meaning the stock is perceived to be cheap relative to its value as compared to its past performance.

The has fallen by 14% in the past year, compared with a 1% rise in the FTSE 100 Index (UK100), a 38% gain for UK rival Astrazeneca ( ) and a 34% rise in the share price for US pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly ( ). The company has undergone significant change in the past year, spinning off its consumer healthcare unit as Haleon (HLN), which began trading on the London Stock Exchange ( ) in July 2022. GSK rebranded from GlaxoSmithKline in May 2022. GSK has cut its dividend to account for the spinoff of Haleon, which will pay its own dividend. It offers investors an attractive yield of 4.7%. So, is GlaxoSmithKline a buy, hold or sell right now? In this GSK stock analysis, we look at the company’s recent announcements, share price performance and the long-term GSK stock forecast. GSK traces its beginnings to Plough Court Pharmacy in London in 1715. In 1856, the pharmacy was renamed Allen & Hanburys and was later acquired by Glaxo Laboratories. Meanwhile, in 1830, the Smith & Gilbert drug wholesaler opened in Philadelphia, US. Gilbert left the business, and by 1870 Mahlon Kline had joined as partner, forming Smith, Kline & Co., which acquired French, Richards & Co. to form Smith, Kline & French Co. in 1891. In 1989, SmithKline Beckman merged with Beecham Group to form SmithKline Beecham. In 1995, the Wellcome Trust sold the Wellcome Foundation to Glaxo, forming Glaxo Wellcome, the world’s largest pharmaceutical company. Glaxo Wellcome merged with SmithKline Beecham to form GlaxoSmithKline in January 2000. GSK’s legacy companies developed medicines and vaccines including “15 first-in-class or combination vaccines and first-of-their-kind medications in respiratory, antibiotics, antivirals and oncology”, according to its . Those form the basis of today’s company, which has grown from a group of individual business founders to a multinational firm with over 70,000 employees. Having spun off its consumer healthcare division, GSK has two remaining divisions, pharmaceuticals and vaccines. The company has more than 60 vaccines and medicines in development, which could drive revenue and profit growth in the future. In December, GSK announced a strategic collaboration with Wave Life Sciences to advance oligonucleotide therapeutics that can modify RNA to treat chronic diseases. Additionally, GSK’s Covid-19 booster vaccine, developed with Sanofi, was approved for use in Britain, following its approval by the European Commission in November. In February 2022, GSK’s majority-owned ViiV Healthcare subsidiary, a specialist HIV company, settled the case against Gilead Sciences ( ) concerning its patents relating to dolutegravir, which is used with other medicines to treat HIV. US-based Pfizer ( ) and Japanese pharmaceutical company Shionogi & Co (4507) are also shareholders in ViiV Healthcare. As part of the settlement, GSK, Shionogi and Gilead negotiated a patent licence agreement under which Gilead has a worldwide licence to use “certain ViiV Healthcare patents relating to dolutegravir”. Gilead made the $1.25bn payment in the first quarter of 2022, and will also pay a 3% royalty on the future US sales of its Biktarvy treatment. GSK’s shares came under pressure in 2022 as litigation in US courts claimed that the heartburn drug ranitidine, sold by GSK under the brand Zantac, caused cancer. On 6 December, a US district court dismissed the claims as providing insufficient evidence. However, there are still tens of thousands of state-court lawsuits pending. The has yet to fully recover from the collapse in share prices at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020. The stock traded up to £18.46 in January 2020 – its highest level since November 2001. It then fell to £14.03 in March 2020, and while it bounced to £16.88 in April 2020, it subsequently declined to £11.91 in February 2021. The development of Covid-19 vaccines brought the share price higher, trending up to £16.23 at the end of 2021. GSK fell to £15.04 in March 2022 as financial markets dropped in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The price rose to £18.69 in April 2022, but again turned lower, falling to £16.47 in early August. The share price then dropped to £14 on 11 August in response to news of the Zantac litigation. GSK stock continued to trade lower, reaching £12.96 on 22 September, before turning higher to trade around £14 again. The stock has been unable to breach the £15 mark, ending 2022 at £14.38 a share. Despite the external pressure on the share price, GSK reported strong growth on 2 November. Total sales rose by 9% to £7.8bn, including a 24% increase in revenues from speciality medicines, a 5% rise in revenue from vaccines and a 1% increase in general medicine sales. The company raised its full-year 2022 guidance, calling for sales growth of 8% to 10% and growth in adjusted operating profit of 15% to 17%. The guidance excludes any contribution from Covid-19 solutions. The Haleon spinoff debuted on the LSE at £3.30 on 18 July 2022, after GSK had rejected three unsolicited offers from consumer goods company Unilever (ULVR) for the business – the most recent a £50bn offer. GSK previously stated it expected the new firm to be a “world leader” in consumer healthcare, offering the prospect of attractive organic sales growth, operating margin expansion, and consistent high cash generation. Over the medium term, GSK expects increased revenue from oral care, vitamins, minerals and supplements (VMS), and pain relief; increasing innovation in the US and China; and extended growth in emerging markets to continue driving sales higher. Products in Haleon’s portfolio include leading brands such as Sensodyne, Voltaren, Panadol and Centrum. The business was a joint venture with Pfizer, with GSK holding a majority 68% stake, while Pfizer owned 32%. Following the demerger, Haleon’s total issued ordinary share capital means that GSK shareholders jointly own 54.5% of the business. Pfizer will continue to hold 32%, GSK will hold 6%, and 7.5% will be held by Scottish limited partnerships that provide funding to GSK pensions. Pfizer is expected to reduce its stake in Haleon following the company’s initial public offering ( ) and the lock-up period. What does the GlaxoSmithKline stock forecast look like after the spinoff and amid the ongoing litigation? As of 11 January 2023, the average GlaxoSmithKline stock forecast from nine analysts that have issued a price target was £15.19, ranging between a low of £12.45 and a high of £19.10, according to . There were four buy ratings and five hold recommendations, with none recommending selling the stock. On 3 January, JP Morgan Chase issued a GlaxoSmithKline stock forecast at £13.50 a share. On 5 January, Jefferies Financial Group set a GSK stock price target of £15.75, while the following day, Credit Suisse set its GSK share price prediction at £15.10. On 9 January, UBS Group predicted that the could fall to £12.45. And on 10 January, Barclays issued a GlaxoSmithKline share price forecast of £14.50. Economic data provider GlaxoSmithKline stock forecast for 2023 indicated that the price could fall to £13.89 by the end of this quarter and £12.78 in a year, based on its global macro model projections and analysts’ expectations. Algorithm-based forecast service estimated that GSK price could stabilise over the next couple of years and then edge lower over the longer term. The site’s GlaxoSmithKline stock forecast for 2025 showed the price ending the year at £14 per share, little changed from £14.02 at the end of this year, then moving down to £13.89 by January 2028. When looking at any GSK stock forecast, you should remember that analysts and algorithm-based forecasters can and do get their predictions wrong. We recommend that you always do your own research before making any investment decisions and remember that past performance is no guarantee of future returns. You should never invest money that you cannot afford to lose. Whether GSK is a good stock to buy for your portfolio will depend on your personal circumstances. The direction of the GSK share price will depend on the outcome of ongoing litigation in the US, as well as the company’s financial performance and overall market sentiment. Whether GSK is a buy, hold or sell for your portfolio depends on your investing goals and timeframe, among other factors. You should do your own research into the company’s performance and evaluate the level of risk you are prepared to accept before investing.

Tech stocks were the primary target as data showed that $9 out of every $10 shorted in tech resulted in a profitable trade in 2022. But will cool down in 2023? Short selling refers to a that aims to profit from a fall in the price of an . In short selling, traders sell that they do not own. Traders borrow the targeted securities from a brokerage, securities lender or . The borrowed securities are sold in anticipation of a price drop. The short seller aims to buy back the securities at a lower price from the open market in order to return the securities to the lender. The short seller will pocket the price difference as profit. Short selling does not always go according to plan and traders risk heavy losses if the price of the shorted securities rises. According to the , short selling benefits the market by providing market and price efficiencies. Investors also use short selling for . 2022 was the year of the short seller. According to financial data analytics company , US equity short sellers booked their highest profits in the last five years in 2022 following a slump in equity market valuations. US equity shorts closed 2022 over 30% higher with total mark-to-market profits of more than $300bn. In comparison, the US benchmark S&P 500 ( ) index and tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 ( ) lost about 19% and 33%, respectively, during the period. Short sellers showed a preference towards technology stocks with all five FAANG stocks – Meta Platforms ( ), Apple ( ), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix ( ) and Alphabet ( ) – among the most profitable short trades in 2022, S3 data showed. Tech stocks which are considered as bore the brunt of the 2022 market as investors reassessed the high company valuations amid rising , high and global concerns. Which tech stocks had the highest short interest? That answer to this question is Tesla, which saw an average short interest of over $18.90bn in 2022. The electric vehicle maker’s 67% slump in 2022 made short sellers mark-to-market profits of about $15.85bn, making it the most profitable short trade in 2022, according to S3 Partners. Tesla’s high price made the stock a frequent target for short sellers. S3 Partners said in a that Tesla’s high volatility was due to its low number of institutional long shareholders. The firm said: Short interest in the stock also increased as Tesla founder Elon Musk sold about $20bn in TSLA stock to fund his acquisition of Twitter. Other notable tech stock shorts in 2022 were fintechs Block ( ), Paypal ( ) and Affirm ( ), on which short sellers made over 100% each in annual profits. Short interest in stocks like Microsoft ( ), Nvidia ( ), Advanced Micro Devices ( ), Shopify ( ), Intel ( ) and Salesforce ( ) also saw short sellers make positive returns from their in 2022. “Shorting the Information Technology sector was like fishing in a barrel with $9 out of every $10 shorted being a profitable trade and 70% of all securities in the sector having down years,” said S3 Partners. The likelihood of tech stock cannot be ruled out. An overcrowded short position in a security is vulnerable to a spike in asset price which can lead to short sellers scrambling for the exit to cut their losses. An eventful year for Twitter that saw the social media platform go private caught short sellers off-guard several times. According to S3 data, Twitter short sellers posted a loss of over 37% ($501.5m) in 2022. The latest short interest data showed the total number of shares sold short fell among top tech stocks like Apple, Meta Alphabet and Tesla. data from 15 December 2022 showed total shares sold short in Apple, Meta, Alphabet and Tesla fell between 0.4% and 5.9% from a fortnight ago. Meanwhile, Amazon and Netflix were among FAANG stocks that saw higher short interest stocks in mid-December 2022 as total shares sold short increased about 10% each from a fortnight ago. S3 Partners on 11 January 2023 that Invesco QQQ Trust ETF ( ) - the biggest exchange traded fund ( ) tracking the Nasdaq-100 index - saw the largest increase in short covering among US ETFs in the last 30 days. Despite a fall in short interest for tech stocks, the tech-focused Invesco QQQ Trust ETF was the second most shorted ETF in the US, as of 6 January 2023, with only the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( ) above it. S3 Partners noted: JP Morgan gave the technology and communications sector a ‘neutral’ rating in its 2023 global equity outlook report as the investment firm expected headwinds such as rising interest rates and elevated US dollar dominance to be “less pronounced” in 2023. The US bank said: Elsewhere, analysts at Jefferies were pessimistic about the tech sector outlook. Jefferies rated all three information technology (IT) sub-sectors – software, hardware and semiconductors – as ‘moderately bearish’. “Although sentiment is starting to improve, the macro setting may only allow for a ‘bear market’ rally at best. Despite the haemorrhaging in earnings, the IT sector doesn’t look cheap,” said Jefferies in a November 2022 note. Meanwhile, Morningstar said in its 2023 U.S. Equity Outlook report : Note that analysts’ forecasts can be wrong.

Tech stocks which are considered to be growth stocks bore the brunt of the 2022 market sell-off as investors reassessed the high company valuations amid rising interest rates, high inflation and global recession concerns.

The estimates are for an EPS of $1.13 with a revenue of $24.16bln. A reminder that earlier in the month, Tesla had announced their Q4 deliveries, which were up 31.5% y/y and 18.5% q/q at 405k, however, missed expectations of 420k. Consequently, this marked the second consecutive quarter that Tesla deliveries underwhelmed estimates highlighting that demand for cars has been slowing given the backdrop of supply chain issues and economic uncertainty. In another sign that demand for cars has softened, the EV company has announced a number of price cuts globally on its vehicles by as much as 20% in a bid to boost market share. Now while traders didn’t react to positively to the recent announcements made by the company, I suspect heading into its financial results sentiment is perhaps a little too bearish. To me, this would suggest that a lot of the negative news has already been reflected in the price and thus bar to surprise on the upside is low. As can be seen in the chart, Tesla shares have bounced from deeply oversold levels. In fact, the RSI had fallen to a record low of 16 in December and thus the recovery appears to be more corrective at this stage. What is somewhat encouraging for dip buyers is the break above resistance at 123.00-124.50, which will need to hold in order to suggest that there is a window for a more persistent recovery in Tesla. Should we see a hold of prior resistance, now support, there is room for a move towards 150.

The company, which makes aircraft engines and power solutions, has seen its share price plummet almost 56% over the past three years. But there are hopes of a brighter 2023 in the wake of a cost reduction programme and the appointment of a new chief executive. Since October 2022 the recovered some losses, bouncing back over 50%. In this we look at what’s happened to the company over the past five years, where it’s focusing attention, and what analysts predict. Rolls-Royce Holdings, which trades on the London Stock Exchange ( ) under the RR ticker, operates in three core business segments: civil aerospace, power systems, and defence. The civil aerospace division builds aircraft engines, power systems provides power solutions to multiple end markets, and defence is involved in the military. As of January 2023, it had customers in more than 150 countries, including more than 400 airlines and leasing customers, 160 armed forces and navies, and more than 5,000 in power and nuclear power. It’s important not to get the company confused with Rolls-Royce motor cars, which is now a totally separate entity owned by BMW. While both businesses can , when Henry Royce established an electrical and mechanical business, they have been on different paths since the early 1970s. What is now known as Rolls-Royce Holdings had been nationalised following bankruptcy but was privatised by the British government in 1987. So, how has the RR share price performed? Well, over the past five years it’s fallen 65%, from 295.40p to 103.76 at market close on 9 January 2023. It’s down 18.72% over the past year. In a research note, Joachim Kotze, an equity analyst at Morningstar, said Rolls-Royce was already in a weak position due to issues with its Trent 1000 engine – and then the coronavirus pandemic hit. He wrote: Kotze pointed out that the group responded with a cost-restructuring program, a £2bn rights issue, and the disposal of assets expected to bring in an additional £2bn. However, the stock has done better more recently with a 19.6% increase having been recorded over the past six months, and rising over 50% since October 2022. Since the beginning of this year, the RR share price has increased 5.8p from 98p. Optimism has been helped by factors such as improving sentiment among some analysts. For example, Jefferies recently raised the stock from a ‘hold’ to a ‘buy’ and lifted its price target from 90p to 125p a share. Any Rolls-Royce share price prediction needs to consider the most recent earnings, with the company having issued in early August 2022. Although it recorded an underlying profit of £5.3bn – up on the £5.2bn for the corresponding period in 2021 – it actually made a loss of £111m. This was partly due to increased financing costs. In a statement, it highlighted a “challenging” external environment, with the Ukraine war, inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints all impacting the business. “We are working across the group to increase the productivity and efficiency of our operations and improve commercial discipline to drive a better and more balanced financial performance,” it stated. In a subsequent issued in early November 2022, the company said there had been a “continued recovery” and that group full year 2022 guidance remained unchanged. The then chief executive, Warren East, said: Tufan Erginbilgic in July 2022, succeeding Warren East who announced last February his intention to step down from the role. Erginbilgic, who has an engineering background and spent more than 20 years with oil giant BP ( ), said he was honoured to be joining at a time of significant commercial opportunity. He said: When the announcement was first made in July 2022, Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, acknowledged the company had endured a tough period, noting: Another development that could help the RR share price is the t being due to take off this year after Virgin Atlantic received government funding to fly using solely sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). One of its flagship Boeing 787s, powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines, will take off from London Heathrow for the journey to New York’s John F Kennedy Airport. The flight is expected to be fuelled by SAF made primarily from waste oils and fats, such as used cooking oil. Mark Harper, Transport Secretary, Department for Transport, said London to New York will be at the forefront of decarbonising flying. “Not only will this flight pave the way for future generations, but it will demonstrate just how much we can achieve when we work together on a shared goal,” he said. So, what are the Rolls-Royce stock forecasts of industry observers? The stock was a ‘hold’, based on the RR share price forecast views of 10 Wall Street analysts, compiled by as of 10 January. However, opinions were divided with four rating it a ‘buy’, four a ‘hold’, and the remaining two a ‘sell’. Their consensus Rolls-Royce share price forecast for 2023 is was for the stock to rise modestly by 1% over the coming year to 104.84p from its 103.76p closing price on 9 January 2023. The highest Rolls-Royce share price forecast came in at 146.74p, while the lowest suggested a fall to 74.87p. According to the algorithmic forecasts of at the time of writing, RR stock was a “bad long-term investment” that was predicted to fall 14% to 89.41p. The site’s Rolls-Royce share price forecast for 2025 saw the stock tumbling to 73p by January 2025 and to 61p by the end of that year. This RR share price forecast doesn’t constitute investment advice. It’s important to remember that analysts’ and algorithm-based Rolls-Royce share price predictions can be wrong. You must always carry out your own due diligence before trading, looking at the latest news, a wide range of commentary, technical and fundamental analysis. Remember that past performance is no guarantee of future returns so you should never invest money you can’t afford to lose. Whether Rolls-Royce Holdings is a good stock for you to buy depends on your view of the company and your personal investment objectives. Remember, it’s very important to reach your own conclusion of the company’s prospects and likelihood of achieving analysts’ targets. There are no guarantees either way. The consensus view of 10 analysts compiled by TipRanks as of 10 January was for RR stock to rise 1% over the coming year to 104.84p. However, analysts’ predictions can be wrong so you’ll need to carry out your own research. This is a decision for you to make based on your analysis. It’s important to draw your own conclusions and not rely solely on Rolls-Royce share price prediction of analysts. Your long-term investment goals and attitude to risk must play a part in the decision-making process.

The quoted Shinya Kotera, president of Kinto, a Toyota leasing subsidiary delivering the all-electric bZ4X into Japan, highlighting the problem. The publication’s report claimed Kinto wouldn’t be able to meet Toyota’s annual sales target of 5,000 units of the bZ4X in either the first or second year. The gloomy news follows last year’s safety recall of 260 bZ4X vehicles in the US that was triggered by concerns hub bolts attaching the wheels were loosening. But what does this mean for shareholders? Is the company still worth considering or should they remain cautious for the time being? In this we look at the company’s latest results, assess the outlook and highlight the Toyota Motor stock predictions of stock market analysts. Our Toyota Motor stock forecast starts with an overview. Toyota was founded in 1937 and has since established itself as one of the largest vehicle makers in the world across a number of brands. These include popular names such as Lexus, Daihatsu, and truck maker Hino, as well as the wide range of Toyota vehicles. In addition, the company owns a large stake in Denso, a parts supplier, as well as around 20%of Subaru, and investments in a range of other businesses. Toyota shares were first listed on the First Section of the Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka stock exchanges in May 1949. They were listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in September 1999. Toyota is currently the second largest automaker by market capitalisation with its $192.05bn valuation only trailing the $375.29bn of Tesla ( ), as of 13 January 2023. It’s certainly been a tough 12 months for investors in as a number of issues have taken their toll on the business. At the start of last year, the TM stock price stood at $201. But as the market closed on 12 January 2023, it was down to $142. These levels are significantly below the stock’s all-time high closing price of $206.11 on 13 January 2022. Looking at the longer-term picture, the TM stock price is currently around where it was five years ago in January 2018, which was $137.20. According to , the company’s 10 year trailing returns came in at 6.28% at the time of writing, which was below the 9.70% for the industry. In November 2022, the company’s revealed sales revenues of 17trn 709.3bn Japanese yen – 14.4% higher than the corresponding period in the previous year. However, operating income was down 34.7% to 1trn 141.4bn yen and the net income figure came in 22.1% lower at 1trn 171 bn yen. The results statement highlighted ongoing problems such as the rapid changes of foreign exchange rates, raising , and soaring materials prices. Alongside production constraints continuing due to low supply of semiconductors, there was also a lockdown in Shanghai and a flood in South Africa. “We worked hard with our dealers, suppliers, and production sites in order to deliver as many cars as possible to our customers,” it stated. “Operating income decreased due to soaring materials prices and one-time costs despite the positive effect from the depreciation of the yen.” The full-year forecast, meanwhile, remained unchanged and is anticipated to see operating income of 2trn 400bn yen. “We have revised our vehicle production forecast downward by 500,000 units to nine million 200 thousand units, taking into consideration risks such as the procurement of semiconductors,” it added. Any Toyota Motor share price forecast should consider the potential impact of other news and a warned of some issues to tackle. It revealed that global sales and production in November 2022 both exceeded the previous year’s level as a result of “solid demand”, particularly in North America. However, it also added a caveat about future results. “The situation remains difficult to predict due to semiconductor shortages and Covid-19,” it stated. “However, we will continue to carefully monitor the parts supply situation and minimize sudden decreases in production as much as possible while making every effort to deliver as many vehicles to our customers at the earliest date.” Elsewhere, it’s fair to say there have been some issues with bZ4X, Toyota’s first mass-produced all electric car. Last year, Toyota a safety recall after hub bolts attaching the wheels were found to loosen at the point where they can detach from the vehicle. According to an update published in early October 2022, the recall involved certain 2023 model year bZ4X in the US. Approximately 260 vehicles were involved. “For all subject vehicles in the US, the hub bolts will be replaced with newly designed hub bolts with washers and the wheels will be replaced with improved ones,” it stated. “The remedy will be provided by Toyota dealers at no cost to the customer.” Separately, The Toyota RAV4 was the best-selling Sport utility vehicle in the US between January and November 2022, according to . The analysis revealed around 333,352 vehicles were sold in this period. Toyota was also the leading brand for passenger cars during this period, with the Toyota Camry recording almost 269,300 sales. So, what are the Toyota Motor stock predictions of stock market analysts covering this fiercely competitive sector? The stock was a ‘hold’ based on the opinions of five analysts compiled by as of 13 January. Four had this rating in place, while one saw it as a ‘buy’. Their consensus view was that the TM stock price could rise to $179.41 in the next twelve months. However, the company was downgraded at the back end of 2022 with Citigroup having reduced its rating from ‘buy’ to ‘neutral’. According to the Toyota Motor stock forecast for 2023 from algorithmic forecaster as of 13 January, the company was “an acceptable long-term investment”.It believed the stock could rise to $149 over the coming year. Meanwhile, the site’s Toyota Motor stock forecast for 2025 had the price reaching $194 by January 2025. However, it remains to be seen what the longer-term impact of the comments attributed to Shinya Kotera of Kinto, the leasing subsidiary and the impact on any future Toyota Motor stock forecast. According to David Whiston, sector strategist at Morningstar, the weak yen weakened Toyota’s purchasing power for raw materials, especially outside Japan. In his TM stock forecast, written in early November 2022, he highlighted the problems that the company has been facing over the past year. He said: This Toyota Motor stock forecast doesn’t constitute investment advice and it’s important to remember that analysts’ predictions can be wrong. You must always carry out your own due diligence before trading, looking at the latest news, a wide range of commentary, and . Past performance is no guarantee of future returns so you should never trade money you can’t afford to lose.

However, the company was downgraded at the back end of 2022 with Citigroup having reduced its rating from ‘buy’ to ‘neutral’. Note that analysts’ predictions can be wrong. This will be up to you.

Pharmaceutical companies have been known to partner with AI companies, but an acquisition is rare. The £562 mn deal is the first ever in the sector, with £363 mn being in cash as BioNTech uses some of the fortune it earned from the Covid-19 vaccine. This move by the German pharma company showcases the changing landscape in the pharmaceutical industry, where AI has become the heart of efficient drug development. It has been common in recent years for Pharmaceutical companies to team up with AI to help develop their bio-technology to aid and speed up the developments of drugs. For example Pfizer ( ) announced in 2016 it intends to ramp up its AI investments and collaborated with MIT and XtaliPi, an AI powered R&D company. Johnson & Johnson ( ) and Novartis ( ) both partnered with IBM’s Watson Health. Roche ( ) partnered with Owkin, another AI start-up. Efforts in biotech developments such as these have been responsible for many scientific breakthroughs, including the Covid-19 vaccine. Sebastian Mallaby, Venture Capital expert, told capital.com in an interview that he thinks the developments in bio-tech may even rival tech companies. He believes this “partly because IT has matured, so much has been done with software, maybe it'll be slowing down a little bit, but also because there have been these breakthrough fundamental technologies, the first one was just the ability to sequence the genome. Then secondly, the ability to sequence the genome super cheaply.” He adds “And then you've got the ability to manipulate MRNA, as we've seen with the Moderna and the Pfizer vaccines. And that could be applied to other technologies” This vaccine was particularly significant in the speed at which it was developed. Mallaby says “artificial intelligence has cracked the code for protein shapes, and that is revolutionary. Used to take a Ph.D. scientist four or five years to figure out the shape of a protein so that you could design a drug that would bind on top of that shape.” While Covid-19 vaccine was developed in less than half of that time frame. The collaborations between AI firms and pharma companies have always remained at the point of a partnership. The outright take-over of InstaDeep by BioNTech ( ) has never been seen before in the industry, and this is likely to be the first of many more as the pharma sector leans into AI developments. As the sector comes out from the pandemic with large amounts of pent up cash, the timing is perfect for the sector to see an increase in such takeovers. reports that AI related deals have in fact been growing at a fact rate in recent times. Their research finds that such deals have grown 47.8% during the first half of 2022, as compared to the same period of 2021. In 2021, BioNTech ( ), along with its partner Pfizer ( ) , found massive success within the development of Covid-19 vaccine. BioNTech alone has earned more than £25 bn from the sales of the vaccine so far, achieving a 77% profit margin. Pharma companies usually have periods of high R&D investments, when profits are low, followed by a period of high profitability and growth once their research is successful. After the boom of the Covid vaccine, BioNTech appears to be again shifting its focus on R&D using the cash it generated in the past two years. BioNTech’s aim with this partnership is to develop an early warning system to predict future variants of the Sars Cov-2 virus. Prof. Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech said in a statement “The acquisition of InstaDeep allows us to incorporate the rapidly evolving AI capabilities of the digital world into our technologies, research, drug discovery, manufacturing, and deployment processes. Our aim is to make BioNTech a technology company where AI is seamlessly integrated into all aspects of our work.” Markets in this article Rate this article Rate this article: Most traded Join the 610,000+ traders worldwide that chose to trade with Capital.com Contact us: CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs.

Microsoft's ( ) $68.7bn (£56bn) takeover of gaming giant Activision Blizzard (ATVI), is not only being hotly debated by global regulators but the ATVI stock price remains resolutely below the MSFT offer. Back in January 2022, Microsoft announced plans to purchase Activision Blizzard for $69bn, or $95 a share. ATVI is currently trading at around $77 per share, as investors price in the risk that the takeover may never happen. Activision shareholders approved the deal in April 2022, with more than 98% of votes in favour. With that said, unlike other tech stocks, the ATVI share price was up 15% last year. Microsoft's stock price plummeted 28% in 2022. But ATVI's share price remaining below the offer is not the only issue that plagues this deal. In December, Microsoft was hit with a further blow in a US court, when a private consumer lawsuit was filed claiming the technology giant’s purchase of the maker will unlawfully hinder competition in the video game market. The complaint was filed in a California federal court with an administrative law judge, in the hope to stop Microsoft, which owns the Xbox console, from finalising one of the largest acquisitions in gaming history. The complaint said: “This is a private antitrust action seeking an order of the Court prohibiting the proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. by Microsoft Corporation as a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act (15 U.S.C. § 18). The threatened loss or damage to the Plaintiffs and to the public at-large by the merging of two giants in the video game industry is extensive and broad.” “In addition to the elimination of a significant rival, the proposed acquisition may give Microsoft far-outsized market power in the video game industry and may enable Microsoft to foreclose rivals to critical inputs and important markets.” The plaintiffs named in the lawsuit are described as “individual citizens of the cities and states listed.” “Each Plaintiff is a consumer of video games, all with the express interest and intent in ensuring that the industry remains competitive,” the lawsuit states. “The potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft threatens loss and harm to the Plaintiffs, and to the public at large, of the salutary benefits of substantial competition within the video game industry.” But that's not the only concern. Global regulators are on a mission to also block the deal - it seems. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is seeking to block technology giant Microsoft from acquiring leading video game developer Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its blockbuster gaming franchises such as . “The FTC alleges that the deal, Microsoft’s largest ever and the largest ever in the video gaming industry, would enable Microsoft to suppress competitors to its Xbox gaming consoles and its rapidly growing subscription content and cloud-gaming business,” a FTC said. The FTC highlights that has a history of acquiring and using valuable content in order to “suppress competition from rival consoles.” This includes its acquisition of ZeniMax, the parent company of Bethesda Softworks (a well-known game developer). “Microsoft decided to make several of Bethesda's titles including Starfield and Redfall Microsoft exclusives despite assurances it had given to European antitrust authorities that it had no incentive to withhold games from rival consoles,” the FTC statement added. “Microsoft has already shown that it can and will withhold content from its gaming rivals,” said Holly Vedova, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition. “We seek to stop Microsoft from gaining control over a leading independent game studio and using it to harm competition in multiple dynamic and fast-growing gaming markets.” Sony ( ) has, unsurprisingly, come out on the 'against' side, given its PlayStation console is in direct competition with Microsoft's X-Box. But Meta ( ), owner of Facebook and Instagram said it has no problem with the deal. Despite this rising tide of uncertainty, Microsoft ( ) Gaming CEO, Phil Spencer is upbeat about the takeover and in a Wall Street Journal Tech Live conference last year, Spencer said regulators investigating the deal have been \"fair and honest\" and he is confident the takeover will go through. But not everyone is convinced that the deal will go as smoothly as hopes. Joshua Raymond, an investment expert wrote in a note: \"This deal was always at significant risk failure from Day One due to issues surrounding anti-competition and the fact the US FTC has now moved to block the acquisition cements this view.” “There has also been much evidence that the market was also expecting failure. Before the news emerged, Activision's share prices were still trading at a 20% discount on the $95 price offered by Microsoft. That tells you the market lacked belief the deal would get done.” With that said, it's not just the FTC that Microsoft has to challenge, but European and UK regulators are scutinising this deal and there is risk it may fall apart. On Friday, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) made the decision to extend the deadline of its inquiry into the deal until 26 April. “In taking this decision, the Inquiry Group had regard to the scope and complexity of the investigation and the need to consider a large volume of evidence as well as main party and third party submissions,” Martin Coleman, Inquiry Group Chair said in a CMA statement. EU antitrust regulators have also questioned the deal and quizzed game developers if they think that MSFT will block ATVI games once it has purchased the company. But MSFT has had some good news. Last month Chilean regulators approved the merger. It was announced last week that Chile’s fiscalia Nacional economica - The National economic Prosecutor’s office had cleared the deal following its phase one investigation. MSFT takeover of ATVI is scheduled to complete this year, but a cloud hangs over the deal - which has caused a huge amount of controversy. From ATVI's low stock price, to global regulators and lawsuits damming the acquisition, MSFT still has a fight on its hands. With some of the biggest markets, such as the US, UK and Europe, all questioning whether the deal will squelch competition, it seems that ’s ambitions to acquire ATVI hangs in the balance.

Markets appear not to be discouraged by the news, share prices have been on an incline since. Shell confirmed last week it will be paying $2.4 bn in windfall taxes in the UK and European Union. This news has not discouraged the markets however, the oil giant’s share price has increased 5% since the announcement. The debate about introducing windfall taxes has been a part of political discourse since the year 2020. The argument being that the astronomical profits which were achieved by the energy giants such as BP ( ) and Shell ( ) were seen as being obtained at huge cost to consumers and should be taxed higher which, in turn, could benefit the government with higher income to help fund energy aid to end users. In recent months, markets were expecting the higher levies to be inevitable. The UK government did indeed increase taxes on energy firms from 25% to 35% starting January 2023, and this will stay in place until 2028. This is expected to earn the UK $65bn in additional income in the next five years. The bigger concern now for energy stock investors is whether the source of the higher profits, oil prices, will be able to sustain for much longer. Oil price pressure appears to have eased in recent months. has lowered to $80 per barrel this week, levels last seen at the start of 2022. Despite this, energy stock prices remain resilient. BP ( ) shares have been up 5% in the past week. Exxon Mobil ( ), Chevron ( ) and TotalEnergies ( ) have seen a similar rise. Mould says one possibility is that “stock markets may be thinking current oil price weakness will not last, once China shakes off the worst of Covid, America starts to replenish its SPR, the global economy starts to pick up pace once more (as it surely will at some stage) and that increased demand meets supply which could still be constrained by sanctions on certain producers and lowly levels of investment by the oil majors. On the other hand he says “it may be that the oil market has it right and the stock market has it wrong, in that a deep recession could take a further, heavier toll on the price of crude, just as it did in 1980, 1991, 2001, 2008 and 2020.” Markets in this article Rate this article Rate this article: Most traded Join the 610,000+ traders worldwide that chose to trade with Capital.com Contact us: CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs.

Founded in 1885 by a German immigrant Marcus Goldman, Goldman Sachs is one of the world’s leading investment banks with operations in 35 countries and an ample portfolio of products and services for individual and corporate clients. The company’s operations can be divided into six segments: : the company provides advisory services to businesses willing to raise capital from investors. : Goldman acts as an intermediary, or a , in the financial markets to facilitate transactions for , , and other . : the bank facilitates trading of products, credit products, mortgages, and commodities. : the bank provides for stocks, exchange-traded funds ( ), and over-the-counter ( ) instruments in equity markets. : this unit offers asset-management products such as , target-dated funds and ETFs. : the bank provides advisory services to high net-worth clients including estate and retirement planning, lending, and private banking. : this unit provides products and services to individual customers such as debit and credit cards, savings and checking accounts, and other similar offerings.

As of 10 January, GS 10-year return amounted to a hefty 214%, outperforming S&P 500 (US500) and Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) in the same period. The GS stock price surged past its pre-pandemic peak in 2021 amid the equity bull market and record-low interest rates in the US. The prevailing optimism helped the bank to generate record revenues and earnings from its market-making and investment banking operations. However, across the globe started monetary tightening in 2022 leading to a sharp drop in the valuation of most financial assets. As a result, investors expected a deterioration of Goldman Sachs’s financial performance, resulting in a 22.4% drop in the GS stock value during the first quarter of 2022. In late 2022 the stock’s performance improved with the easing of inflationary pressures, with GS rising 15.8% in the final quarter of the year.

This would amount to 6.5% of the bank’s global workforce.

Morgan Stanley’s Betsy Graseck commented for : The chances of a US recession have increased to 96%, as per October estimates by the . Goldman Sachs’ third-quarter revenues declined 12% on the previous year to $11.98bn amid slower deal-making on the Investment Banking side. An overall drop in the valuation of financial assets resulted in lower fees for the Asset Management and Wealth Management units. Meanwhile, during the first nine months of 2022, Goldman Sachs generated revenues of $36.77bn and net earnings of $9.94bn, compared to $42.03bn and $17.34bn it produced respectively during the same period a year ago.

Major banks from JP Morgan ( ), to Wells Fargo ( ) and Citigroup ( ) lead this week and then we have Morgan Stanley ( ) and Goldman Sachs ( ) reporting on 17 January. 2022 was a tough year for banks and equities, so what can we expect from and next week? stock price was down 13% in 2022, a stark contrast to the previous year, when it surged 43%. share price plummeted 10%, versus 2021, when it was up 45%. Rising inflation, interest rate hikes and a troubling macro-economic environment has caused a decline in stocks globally. According to Factset, analysts expect S&P 500 ( ) companies to report their first year- over-year earnings decline since 2020. So, as major banks start to release their quarterly earnings and investors look to how they will perform in 2023, the role of central banks and the decisions made, will play heavily into how banking stocks like and perform this year. “Central banks and policymakers are trying to manage inflation on one hand but do so without tipping heavily indebted economies into recession on the other (all while keeping an eye on their currencies and financial market stability for good measure),”AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. “Given that central banks made a mess of it with their call that inflation would be ‘transitory,’ it would be logical to apply a large dollop of salt to their claim that they can engineer a ‘soft landing’ as they rein in inflation.” enjoyed a boom in 2021 and at the start of 2022, as mergers and acquisitions (M&A) peaked after the Covid pandemic. However, takeovers have fallen and interest rates have risen, leading to company valuations declining. As one of the world’s biggest investment banks, has already started 2023 with its biggest rounds of redundancies this week, and will cut over 3,000 jobs in a bid to save costs. CEO, David Solomon informed staff in December that the job cuts were critical if it were to “weather the headwinds,” caused by rising rates. It’s also been reported that is considering cutting as many as 4,000 jobs, as well as making cuts of 40% to its bonus pool. Solomon maybe hoping the job cuts will offer a positive sign to its bank's shareholders, ahead of its earnings release next week. 's earnings report will be for its fourth-quarter and according to Zacks investment Research - based on 8 analysts forecasts, the consensus earnings per share (EPS) forecast for the quarter is $6.13. The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was $10.81. Daniela Hathorn, senior analyst at Capital.com said: “In Q4 banks are expected to report higher net interest income given the higher interest rate environment but challenging market conditions have likely reduced dealmaking, something that the banking giants have already warned about.” “This means that market expectations are probably pretty low going into the start of this earnings season, meaning there will be a good chance for greater upside if the numbers don't seem as bad as expected or even manage to come in-line or beat expectations.” However, is trying to get its 2021 glow back. The company is one of the major players in the investment banking (IB) business and is implementing measures to diversify its operations. “ is making efforts inorganically to boost asset management and wealth management businesses while expanding its digital consumer banking platform –Marcus by Goldman Sachs,” analysts at Zacks Research wrote in a note. “In August 2022 acquired robo-advisor NextCapital. In April 2022, Goldman closed the acquisition of Dutch asset manager NN Investment Partners from NN Group N.V., while in March, the company closed the buyout of GreenSky. In 2020 and 2019, the company acquired Folio Financial and United Capital, respectively.” Experts believe these inorganic growth efforts will help diversify the fee-revenue base and offer top-line stability. Nevertheless, IB business fell in the first nine months of 2022, caused by a decline in industry-wide M&A transactions. But some analysts are still optimistic. “Goldman’s solid position in worldwide announced and completed M&A's will likely give it an edge over its peers. Robust client engagement, backed by digital disruption and transformation trends, and its decent investment banking backlog are other tailwinds,” Zacks analysts said. “Also, looks undervalued with respect to price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios. The stock has a P/E (F1) ratio of 10.89, which is lower than the industry average of 14.50.

However, over the last four weeks, the share price has been down 2%, lagging the finance sector's loss of 1.02% and the S&P 500’s loss of 1%, for the same period. Investors will be hoping for a strong start to the year, as approaches its earnings release. “In that report, analysts expect Morgan Stanley to post earnings of $1.32 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 36.54%,” Zacks analyst said. “Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $12.17bn, down 16.18% from the year-ago period.” But analysts have also highlighted investors should note that has a forward P/E ratio of 12.13 right now.

The has reached its highest level in two years, reversing the losses of the Covid-19 pandemic. What has been driving the share price higher? Is there potential for further gains or has the stock topped out? Let’s look at the stock’s performance and some of the latest Standard Chartered share price predictions from analysts. Standard Chartered, also known as StanChart, was established in 1969 from a merger between the Standard Bank of British South Africa and the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China. The banks had benefited from the expansion of trade between Asia, Europe and Africa. While Standard Chartered is headquartered in the UK, it does not conduct any retail banking business in the UK. The company’s largest market is China. StanChart’s primary stock market listing is on the London Stock Exchange ( ) and it is included in the FTSE 100 Index (UK100) of the 100 largest companies on the LSE by . It also has secondary listings on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India and the over-the-counter ( ) Pink Market. Standard Chartered’s largest shareholder is Temasek Holdings, an investment company owned by the Government of Singapore. The Standard Chartered share price fell in 2020 as economic activity in Asia slowed during Covid-19 restrictions, with the share price bottoming out at £3.37 in September of that year. The stock rebounded to £4.66 by the end of 2020 and rose to £5.20 by April 2021, but the price came under pressure later in the year and fell to £4.48 by the end of December. In 2022, the STAN price initially rose to £5.81 but fell to £4.50 on 7 March as stocks fell in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and renewed lockdowns in China. The stock recovered to £6.33 in June but subsequently traded down and bottomed out at £5.20 in October. The share price has since trended higher as market sentiment has improved with the prospect of the US Federal Reserve ( ) slowing the pace of rate hikes and China reopening its economy. The share price gains have accelerated since 30 December as China has rapidly relaxed its Covid-19 restrictions, climbing from £6.22 on 30 December to £7.05 on 5 January. On 4 January, the share price rose from £6.40 to £6.60 after said that it had become the first foreign bank to participate in treasury bond futures trading in China. Jerry Zhang, executive vice chairman and chief executive officer (CEO), Standard Chartered China, stated: On 5 January, the stock climbed from £6.60 to £7.05 in response to reports that First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), the biggest lender in the United Arab Emirates and one of the largest banks in the Middle East, said that it had considered a bid for the company but was no longer exploring a takeover. Standard Chartered has long been a takeover target, with UK banking giant Barclays having considered a bid in 2018. The share price has also been supported in recent sessions by a report that the Chinese government is preparing a new round of measures to relieve stress in the country’s real estate sector. The company’s revenues have fallen in recent years following a rapid expansion into emerging markets. Bill Winters, a former J.P. Morgan executive, has been CEO since June 2015, tasked with turning around the company’s performance. Rising interest rates are improving the company’s outlook and the reopening of China and Hong Kong are improving its prospects. For the third quarter, reported a return on tangible equity of 10.1%, up by 3.8 basis points from the third quarter of 2021. Income rose by 15% to $4.3bn on a normalised basis and 22% on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of exchange rate volatility on its results. Net interest income was up 24% at constant currency on a normalised basis. Earnings per share increased by $0.10, or 43%, to $0.331. The company expects its full-year income to rise by around 13% in line with its year-to-date growth. That is driven in part by its double-digit income growth in China despite the macro challenges in the region. “In the markets in our footprint, we see plenty of reasons to be optimistic about 2023. And we see a continued recovery post the pandemic. We see economic growth rates remaining healthy and inflation is not on the same scale or the same issue as we see in the West,” Winters said on the . What is the outlook for the STAN share price given the company’s recent performance? Below, we look at the potential Standard Chartered stock forecast as offered by market analysts. At the time of writing, the average 12-month price target from six Wall Street analysts that have issued a Standard Chartered share price forecast was £8.15, according to data provider , ranging from a low of £7.50 to a high of £9. Four of the analysts have issued buy recommendations, compared with two hold ratings and no sell recommendations. Following Standard Chartered’s earnings report on 26 October, analysts at Shore Capital reiterated their buy rating and Jason Napier at UBS set a price target of £8.55 a share. On 27 October, Berenberg Bank reiterated its buy rating with the low end Standard Chartered share price forecast of £7.50 and Robert Noble at Deutsche Bank reiterated a buy rating and set the high end of the forecast range at £9 per share. However, the Standard Chartered share price forecast for 2023 from economic data provider indicated that the stock could move up to £6.74 by the end of this quarter and then fall to £6.20 in one year, based on global macro model projections and analysts’ expectations. Looking further ahead, the Standard Chartered share price forecast for 2025 from algorithm-based forecaster at the time of writing projected that the price could fall to £5.96, trending lower from £6.44 at the end of this year. When consulting any Standard Chartered stock forecast, it’s important to remember that market and macroeconomic volatility can make it difficult for analysts and algorithm-based forecasters to come up with accurate long-term predictions. As such, they can and do get their predictions wrong. You should always do your own research. Look at the latest market trends, news, technical and fundamental analysis, and expert opinion before making any investment decision. Keep in mind that past performance is no guarantee of future returns. And never invest money you cannot afford to lose. Whether Standard Chartered is a good stock for you to buy depends on your portfolio composition and investing time horizon. The direction of the STAN share price in the future will likely depend on the company’s performance as well as macroeconomic sentiment and government monetary policies on interest rates, among other factors. Keep in mind that past performance is no guarantee of future returns. Deciding whether to invest in STAN or any other asset is a personal call only you can make depending on your financial circumstances, risk tolerance and trading approach. You should do your own research to make an informed decision.

Coinbase (COIN) was hit with the penalty by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) on 4 January, after the regulator found that Coinbase had treated its onboarding requirements for customers as a “simple check-the-box” and had not carried out proper background checks. NYDFS superintendent Adrienne Harris said: “Coinbase failed to build and maintain a functional compliance program that could keep pace with its growth. That failure exposed the Coinbase platform to potential criminal activity.” Coinbase acknowledged the fine and, in a blog post, said that the investigation was based on the company’s compliance programme in around 2018 and 2019, as well as the compliance backlogs that built up as the exchange expanded in 2021, : “We took NYDFS’s concerns seriously and have taken substantial measures to address these historical shortcomings.” The news caused the price of COIN to fall overnight, from $37.70 at the close of trading on 4 January to $34.71 when markets opened the following day. The price of the stock has continued to fall and, as of 6 January 2023, it was worth about $32.80. The fall in price comes as the exchange faces the ongoing fallout from the . What is the outlook for the Coinbase share price over the long term? Is now the time to add COIN to your on the ? In this article, will we look at the prospects for Coinbase’s stock over the next five years. US-based Coinbase is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume after Cayman Islands-registered Binance, based on data from . Coinbase was founded in 2012 by its chief executive officer (CEO) Brian Armstrong, a former engineer at Airbnb ( ), and Fred Ehrsam, a former trader at Goldman Sachs ( ). Ehrsam left the company in 2017 to pursue other opportunities in the cryptocurrency space, but remains on the Coinbase board of directors. Coinbase stock provides a way for retail and to take a on the cryptocurrency markets in their stock portfolios without having to buy and sell coins and tokens on exchanges or hold them in separate wallets. Coinbase went public on the via a direct listing in April 2021 during a strong cryptocurrency market rally. The bitcoin price ( ) reached a new high at the time above $63,000 in anticipation of the listing. COIN stock launched with a reference price of $250 per share and closed its first trading session at $328.28 per share. The stock has since been highly correlated with the direction of the bitcoin price, falling to around $224 per share during the May 2021 sell-off and rebounding to $342.98 in November 2021 when bitcoin reached its all-time high above $68,000. Both bitcoin and the COIN stock price have been in an extended downward trend in the past year. The COIN share price started 2022 at $251.05 per share and declined to $153.19 on 14 March, as the US dollar strengthened and cryptocurrencies sold off in a flight to safe-haven assets in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The stock ticked up above $204 toward the end of March, but then resumed its decline and dropped to $53.72 per share on 11 May, as the terra (LUNA) cryptocurrency ecosystem collapsed and the dollar climbed to a 20-year high against a basket of currencies. COIN rebounded to $98 per share in August, as the financial markets anticipated a slowdown in the pace of US hikes, which have continued to drive the dollar higher. But the markets subsequently pulled back and the dollar strengthened as data continued to show consumer prices at their highest levels in decades. That indicated the US Federal Reserve ( ) would hike interest rates further, supporting the strong dollar and weighing on asset classes including stocks and cryptocurrencies. The COIN stock price declined to $62.78 on 6 September, moved up to $82.55 on 12 September, and then turned lower, falling below $62 later in the month. COIN traded between $63 and $75 in October, before dropping to a fresh low of $45.98 on 9 November in response to turmoil at the FTX exchange, which subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection on 11 November 2022. In a blog post on 8 November, Coinbase Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Alesia Haas : Haas added: “There can’t be a ‘run on the bank’ at Coinbase. As you can review in our publicly filed, audited financial statements, we hold customer assets 1:1… we believe that what’s happening now is yet another example of why strong, clear regulatory standards are so important. Fragmented, opaque regulatory frameworks in the US are driving crypto to offshore unregulated exchanges, where looser regulations can put customers at risk.” At the end of the third quarter of 2022, Coinbase held $5.6bn in total available USD resources, including $5bn in cash and cash equivalents. “What happened at FTX is not possible to happen at Coinbase, and we are a regulated institution,” Armstong told on 10 November. Coinbase’s third-quarter results on 3 November showed that the company’s revenue dropped by 53.4% from the third quarter of 2021 to $576m, and it recorded a net loss of $545m, compared with a net income of $406m in the third quarter of 2021. But subscription and services revenue increased by 45.5% year-on-year to $211m from $145m. The company’s monthly transacting users (MTUs) rose by 16.4% year-on-year, to 8.5 million from 7.3 million a year earlier, although that was down from 11.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Coinbase reduced its operating expenses by 22% during the quarter, including through the implementation of job cuts, and said it will continue to closely manage its expenses given the current macroeconomic conditions. Coinbase is expanding its partnerships to increase the adoption of cryptocurrencies among institutional investors and for online payments. In August 2022, announced an agreement with BlackRock ( ), the world’s largest asset management company, to provide institutional clients of BlackRock’s Aladdin investment management platform with direct access to cryptocurrencies through Coinbase Prime, starting with bitcoin. In October 2022, the company a partnership with Google ( ) to allow Google Cloud customers to pay for the services with cryptocurrencies supported by Coinbase Commerce. Under the agreement, Coinbase is transferring its data applications from the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform to Google Cloud. The company is moving to a product structure with four groups: consumers, institutions, developers, and platforms. The new platform group “is there to build the shared components across the different product groups that all of our products use, for instance, connecting into the different blockchains out there, generating transactions, storing crypto, things like that,” Armstrong on the earnings conference call. “I think there’s actually opportunities to thrive in this environment,” Armstrong said. What is the outlook for the COIN share price over the long term? What do analysts think of the Coinbase stock projections for the next five years? What could a Coinbase stock forecast in five years’ time look like? Armstrong expects there will be a clearer regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies around the world in five years, which will “unlock a lot more institutional capital”. Armstrong noted that blockchain scalability, the ability to maintain performance as traffic increases, will continue to improve, with new layer-2 solutions that will enable new use cases. More countries could adopt cryptocurrency as legal tender, as El Salvador has with bitcoin, and many are likely to pursue central bank digital currencies ( ). What does that mean for the COIN share price? The median price forecast from 23 analysts who have issued a 12-month Coinbase stock forecast as on 6 January was $82.30, according to data compiled by , with estimates ranging from a low of $30 to a high of $275. There were 10 ‘buy’ ratings, 10 ‘hold’ and four ‘sell’ recommendations. On 5 January, market analysts Cowen downgraded their assessment of COIN from ‘outperform’ to ‘market perform’. The Coinbase long-term stock forecast from algorithm-based platform raised questions about the company’s long-term viability, predicting that the share price could drop to $0.000001 by January 2024. Prediction service was more optimistic about the outlook for the COIN five-year forecast, projecting it could close 2027 at between $7.07 and $8.29 per share. Other platforms refrained from issuing Coinbase stock five-year forecasts due to high crypto market volatility. If you are looking for a COIN forecast to inform your trading approach, it’s important to remember that, given the volatility of the cryptocurrency markets, it is difficult for analysts and algorithm-based forecasters to come up with accurate long-term predictions. We recommend that you always do your own research. Look at the latest market trends, news, technical and fundamental analysis, and expert opinions before making any investment decision. Keep in mind that past performance is no guarantee of future returns, and never invest money you cannot afford to lose. It is difficult to say for sure where COIN stock will be price-wise in five years’ time due to the volatility of cryptocurrency markets. Prediction service was downbeat about the future COIN price as of 6 January 2023, projecting it could head into 2028 at $7.07 and $8.29 per share. Algorithm-based website saw the stock sharply declining in value by the end of 2023. Bear in mind that analysts’ Coinbase stock forecasts can be wrong and have been inaccurate in the past. Always conduct your own research before investing or trading. As with the longer-term stock price projection for COIN, it is difficult to forecast the stock’s price due to broader crypto market volatility. Remember to always do your own research before trading or investing. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Whether you think it is a good time to buy Coinbase stock depends on your personal circumstances, such as risk tolerance and investing goals. Remember that past performance does not guarantee future returns, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Sure, the is in many senses much like the and the . That's not hugely a surprise, they're all supposed to be passive index trackers on the S&P 500, they're all large enough to actually hold the stocks themselves, why wouldn't they be pretty much the same? But they're not all the same, and this is something that we need to grasp about all sorts of securities. Even tiny differences can mean that we can and should use a specific security for one case – say, speculation or trading – and another seemingly similar one for investment purposes – buy and hold strategies say. Equally, there are some instruments which should only ever be used as a part of one of those basic approaches and never for the other because they're simply not designed for it. So much so that there are some entirely sensible products that are in fact built to lose us money if we hold them. They're built for entirely other purposes. Just to be able to create examples we're going to call speculation, or trading, what we do expecting a price movement in the next few hours to days. That would cover much FX business, some stock market and no near corporate debt trading. Conversely we’ll call investing the sort of thing we do to build our pensions. Buying something boring and sensible and sticking it away for decades with dividend reinvestment. Do note those aren't real and firm definitions of those strategies – they're just what we're going to use for the next few paragraphs. So, take the example of something like . Effectively the company is a great big pile of yellow cake uranium, the traded form. The only reason it exists at all is to provide people with the ability to trade the uranium price. For fairly obvious reasons – like some forms of uranium can be used to make really big bangs – there're very few people with licences that allow physical trading of uranium. That then means there can't be futures – how could you deliver? - and so there's no liquid market. This makes the people who play with uranium mining stocks sad as it prevents any hedging strategies. So, create a company whose shares can be traded that should mimic the uranium price. Pretty much an ETF in fact but not of that legal form – it's closed ended, not open. There's no point in buying YCA and tucking it away. It's not trying to build a business and grow, it's just a pile of uranium. The entire point of the existence is so that people can trade on the uranium price, hedge. We could also look at the whole world of , or options, futures. They're there to be traded, not invested in. A significant part of the value at any one time is the time value of them – how long before they expire? The volatility of the underlying times the time to expiry will be a more or less substantial part of their value at any one time. Locking them away into the pension fund would be ludicrous as we'd just be insisting upon losing that time value. We can also look at an entirely different class of securities, corporate bonds. Outside a very few really large issuances these are really pretty illiquid. The average corporate bond trades twice in its lifetime, at issue and redemption. That means they're pretty illiquid and that, in turn means there are wide spreads (not to say often high minimum dealing sizes: $200k nominal isn't unusual). Wide spreads means we're leaving too much on the table each turn to want to be dealing them. There are exceptions, if there's a Chapter 11, Chapter 7, going on and we want to speculate upon recovery but those are special situations. This horses for courses idea extends into ETFs as well, Some are deliberately designed to be traded not held, others, well, it varies on the tiny little details. For example, there is a whole series of 3x ETFs. Dirextion is only one provider and it has a whole range of products: ; and yes, of course, there's a Bull 3x (TMF); and so on. In fact there's a whole universe of these geared ETFs. But it's that very fact of the gearing which makes them absurd vehicles for investing. For what gives them the 3x is the use of options and futures and so on inside the funds. Which leaves them subject to that decline in the time value of those instruments pointed out above. So, the geared ETFs are guaranteed to lose money over time. They're instruments deliberately designed for speculative and hedging purposes and in the short term only. Some versions of some of them will lose 1% a day in a flat market because of this design feature. It's like the old joke about tinned herrings* – no, these are for trading, not investing. Some things should be used to trade in, others are for investing. Using the right instrument for the right purpose is obviously going to aid any particular strategy we're trying to employ. Which brings us back to the S&P 500 ETFs. The three I mentioned, SPY, VOO and IVV are all large enough to be holding the actual stocks in proportion so we're not going to lose time value from the structure. They're just fine to be stashed away for the ages or to be used to trade, speculate or hedge. Except they're not all equal for those two different strategies. These will sound like very small differences but compounded over decades they do make a difference. SPY charges an annual fee of 9.45 basis points while IVV and VOO charge only 3. So, the two lower fee versions are better for that long term purpose. After all, given that all three are tracking the index better to have that index minus 3 bps rather than 9.45 year after year for many of those years. Might only mean the difference between Nescafe and Gold Blend in retirement but why let other people have the money instead of us? On the other hand, SPY has much more trade in it – the technical word for that being liquidity. Liquidity means lower bid/ask spreads. Meaning that each time we move in and out as a trade then we're giving less of our money to the system. So, for trading – speculation, hedging – SPY is the better vehicle. Again, the difference is small, but small differences add up over time and numbers of trades. As is obvious, there's a sweet spot in that timing where the lower bps annual fee meets the wider spread and exactly where that is is left as an exercise for the reader. This is an explanation of the background, not an explication of the optimum. Some instruments are designed for short term positions, trading and speculation, others for the long. Some others are just better for each strategy just because, that's the way it works out. Using the right instrument for the strategy we're employing is just plain good sense. Horses for courses, tools for the task and all that. It's only the bloke who only has a hammer that thinks everything is a nail.

Bed Bath & Beyond is a retail store operator that sells home furnishings, beauty and wellness, and baby products. The company is based in New Jersey, US. It was founded in 1971 by Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein. Bed Bath & Beyond stock is listed on the under the ticker symbol BBBY. As of , Bed Bath & Beyond operated 953 retail stores across the US, Puerto Rico and Canada. The company has a joint venture that operates 11 stores in Mexico under the name Bed Bath & Beyond.

The company added that it is considering several strategic alternatives including restructuring, debt refinancing, and additional debt to revive its business. Bed Bath & Beyond will also consider delaying its business activities and selling in order to turn around its business. BBBY said net sales for the quarter ended 26 November 2022 were expected to fall by over 30% compared to the same period last year due to lower store footfall and reduced inventory. The company added that it expected a net loss of about $385.8m for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The firm’s CEO Sue Gove commented: “Reduced credit limits resulted in lower levels of in-stock presentation within the assortments that our customers expect. Consequently, we have already leveraged the liquidity gained from the holiday season to immediately pursue higher in-stock levels with support from our key vendors.” The company said it had commenced an exchange offer to refinance its unsecured senior notes which expired on 4 January. However, the deal was terminated after the conditions of the exchange offer were not met. As of 27 August 2022, the company’s long-term debt stood at $1.729bn and cash in hand at $166.7m. BBBY is expected to announce its third-quarter earnings on 10 January 2023. BBBY stock price fell 29% to $1.63 on the day of the announcement, reaching its lowest level since February 1993, as the company said it was considering “obtaining relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code”. It’s important to note that a – Chapter 11 and Chapter 7. Under bankruptcy, a company provides a plan to reorganise its business. It aims to get out of debt and be profitable again. Day-to-day operations will continue to run but major corporate decisions will have to be approved by the bankruptcy court. The company’s stock and will continue to trade on the market. The bankruptcy plan laid forth by the company will have to be approved by creditors, bondholders, stockholders and court. Although the court has the power to overrule the vote and approve the bankruptcy plan if it finds the plan suitable for the parties involved. On the other hand, bankruptcies are filed by companies that are too deep into debt and have no way out. These companies cannot continue their business operations therefore their assets are sold for cash by the court in order to pay off creditors. As of 5 January 2023, Davis Selected Advisers, Capital Research & Management and The Vanguard Group were the top three institutional shareholders of BBBY with a combined stake of 32.1%, data compiled by showed.

In such an event, the company’s stock will be delisted from the exchanges. The stock may continue trading on over-the-counter ( ) markets. In the event of a liquidation, secured creditors are paid first. Unsecured creditors are paid next. Secured creditors are often banks while unsecured creditors are usually banks, suppliers and bondholders. Shareholders have the last claim during bankruptcy and may not receive anything if secured and unsecured creditors are not fully paid. “The bankruptcy court may determine that stockholders don't get anything because the debtor is insolvent. If the company's liabilities are greater than its assets, your stock may be worthless,” said the SEC. Shareholders should be aware that even if a company is successful in reorganising its business, the ownership structure of the reorganised company will be different. “In most instances, the company's plan of reorganisation will cancel the existing equity shares. This happens in bankruptcy cases because secured and unsecured creditors are paid from the company's assets before common stockholders. And in situations where shareholders do participate in the plan, their shares are usually subject to substantial dilution,” said the SEC. The SEC added that there can be two different types of for a company that comes out of bankruptcy. The old common stock represents shares on the market at the time when the company went into bankruptcy. It will trade with a five-letter ticker that ends with ‘Q’. The new common stock ticker will not end with ‘Q’. Investors need to be aware of which stock they are purchasing.

Wells Fargo and Telsey Advisory Group cut their BBBY stock price target to $2 from $3 on 5 January 2023 following BBBY bankruptcy concerns, data showed.

It says that these standalone ventures will be “better positioned to deliver long-term growth and create value for customers, investors, and employees.” The plan is to create two separate companies for Aviation and Healthcare businesses and a third corporation that will own and operate the conglomerate’s renewable energy, power, and digital business units. The upcoming GE split means that the stockholders of record by the time the spin-offs are completed will be entitled to receive shares in all these new businesses. As of 6 January 2022, 's stock has lost close to 10% of its value over the past year. The company’s strategy and upcoming divisions are likely targeted at turning the company’s fortunes around. In this article, we will share further details about the upcoming General Electric splits so our readers can be informed about what could happen if they own shares of the conglomerate, or plan to buy some. are financial transactions that consist of multiplying the outstanding shares of a company by a certain number. Every of the business is entitled to receive a certain number of shares for every stock they own at the moment the split is performed. For example, if a company decides to perform a 4-for-1 stock split, it means that a stockholder of record will receive 3 additional shares for every stock they own. As a result, instead of owning one share, they will own four shares in the company. A stock split does not affect the financial performance of a firm nor does it improve its valuation in any way. Companies typically use these operations to increase the liquidity of their equity instruments, potentially making them more attractive to retail investors by lowering their price, or to comply with the listing requirements of a given exchange. It is important to note that the upcoming GE split will result in the creation of three separate companies, which is different from a stock split. It is unclear whether future General Electric stock splits – divisions of the new companies’ stock – will occur. The upcoming division of the company will effectively mean that the current stock – GE – will no longer trade on the stock market, and will gradually be replaced by three new, different firms which will likely trade under new stock .

During the first semester of the 2022 fiscal year, produced total revenues of $35.7bn. GE Aerospace accounted for the bulk of that total, with revenues of $11.7bn, followed by GE Healthcare ($8.9 billion), GE Power ($7.7bn) and Renewable Energy at ($6bn). The CEO of General Electric is H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. By the end of 2021, GE was, reportedly, employing 168,000 people in its affiliated companies. This includes 40,000 employees in the Aerospace unit, 48,000 people employed by the Healthcare unit, another 38,000 working for the Renewable Energy business and 32,000 employed in the Power unit. The company is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. General Electric stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( ) under the ticker symbol ‘GE’. The company’s shares are also listed in many other exchanges around the world, including Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Switzerland, Italy and France. In the past 5 years, General Electric stock produced a 46.92% loss for investors compared to the 43.61% and 79.07% gains produced by the ( ) and the tech-heavy ( ), respectively, during that same period. According to data from a General Electric stock split has occurred seven times in the past. The following is a list of past stock splits performed by the company: – 2-for-1 split – 2-for-1 split – 2-for-1 split – 2-for-1 split – 2-for-1 split – 3-for-1 split – 1-for-8 split (this has been the only General Electric reverse stock split) The timetable for the upcoming General Electric split starts with the spin-off of the company’s healthcare unit into a publicly traded entity that has already been named GE HealthCare. Shares in this new entity will be listed in the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol GEHC according to Form 10 registration statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( ). The spin-off was completed during the first week of 2023 after General Electric’s Board of Directors approves the transaction and other regulatory requirements are fulfilled. General Electric distributed 80.1% of GEHC stock among the owners of GE stock in correspondence with the number of shares they own. Moreover, the former parent company of the healthcare business has retained the remaining 19.9% stake in the business. GEHC shares rose as much as 8.4% in their Nasdaq debut on 4 January, and its chief executive said the company was looking to do small acquisitions to boost its cardiology and oncology operations in the long term, according to a report. The next business to be spun-off will be GE Vernova. This company will reunite the firm’s renewable energy, power, digital, and energy financial services businesses into one entity. The resulting GE stock split is expected to occur in early 2024. After this last spin-off, General Electric will be renamed ‘GE Aerospace’, an aviation-focused business that will own and operate an installed base of 39,400 commercial and 26,200 military aircraft. “By creating three separate companies, each will benefit from greater focus, tailored capital allocation, and strategic flexibility to drive long-term growth and value,” management team commented in an investor update published on 18 July 2022. Further details about how many shares of the newly-created companies each GE shareholder will get as a result of this General Electric stock split will be shared by the Board of Directors and leadership team of the original company after the official GE split date for each entity is announced. GE stock has recorded a 10% decline since the company announced the upcoming split into three different entities. A stock split or a spin-off does not have an immediate impact on the financial performance of a business. In this regard, the leadership team of GE has stated on multiple occasions that they believe in the benefits resulting from letting these three units operate as standalone companies as they will be more flexible and adaptive than now. External factors including a complex macroeconomic environment marked by strong inflationary pressures and rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions in Europe amid Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, and challenging supply chain conditions have weighed the most in the performance of GE’s equity lately. Moving forward, the evolution of these variables may have a higher influence on the valuation of these businesses rather than company-specific factors or the upcoming GE splitting. According to data from , the consensus recommendation for General Electric stock is ‘moderate buy’, based on the opinion of 11 analysts. The majority of these financial services firms – 10, to be exact – have rated the stock a ‘buy’. Two analysts maintainted a \"hold\" rating on the stock as of Meanwhile, the average price target for GE stock, as of 6 January 2023, stood at $93.42 a share, resulting in a 31.2% upside potential. The highest price target sat at $136 and the lowest at $73. Back in November 2021, when the GE split was announced, analyst Joseph O’Dea from Wells Fargo told : Meanwhile, analysts from commented the following in January last year: Finally, analyst Joshua Aguilar from stated the following in July 2022: “Larry Culp is engineering a successful turnaround of GE that the market still has yet fully to appreciate. We think shares have unfairly priced in deal limbo following GE's announcement that it will spin off its healthcare business in early 2023, and its energy business in early 2024.” While news of a stock split may provide valuable insight into a company’s performance, they should not be used as a substitute for your own research. Always do your own due diligence before making an investment decision, based on a broad selection of analyst commentary, market data, and respected news sources. And never invest or trade money that you cannot afford to lose. GE will will split its business into three standalone companies. This will not result in a stock split. Instead, shareholders of GE will receive a certain number of shares in the newly created companies once the spin-off is completed. General Electric will be separated into three standalone businesses: GE HealthCare, GE Aviation, and GE Vernova. The spin-off of GE HealthCare is expected to be completed in the first week of 2023 while the GE Vernova spin-off is expected to occur in early 2024. General Electric currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share resulting in a dividend yield of 0.47% as of 19 October 2022.

The exchange was given the by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) on 4 January after the regulator found that Coinbase treated its onboarding requirements for customers as a “simple check-the-box” and had not carried out sufficient background checks. NYDFS superintendent Adrienne Harris said: “Coinbase failed to build and maintain a functional compliance program that could keep pace with its growth. That failure exposed the Coinbase platform to potential criminal activity.” Coinbase acknowledged the fine and, in a blog post, said that the investigation was based on the company’s compliance programme in 2018-2019, as well as the compliance backlogs that built up as the exchange grew in 2021. It : “We took NYDFS’s concerns seriously and have taken substantial measures to address these historical shortcomings.” The exchange will also have to spend a further $50m on improving its compliance, and will have to work with a third-party monitor. As a result of the news, the price of COIN shares fell from $37.70 at close of trading on 4 January to $34.71 when markets opened the following day. The fine and the resulting price drop come soon after the sent shockwaves through the markets. FTX, formerly the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, recently filed for bankruptcy, highlighting the liquidity struggles the industry faces. In a , Coinbase stated: “Currently we have $15m worth of deposits on FTX to facilitate business operations and client trades. We have no exposure to Alameda Research, and we have no loans to FTX.” However, it is alleged that Coinbase plans to participate in the to seek a claim on those deposits. Coinbase’s third-quarter were also underwhelming, as the industry is braced for intensifying “macro headwinds”. Q3 transaction revenue fell to $366m, down 44% compared to Q2, driven by lower trading volume. The loss of earnings stood at $2.43 per share, adjusted, vs. the projected loss of $2.40 per share expected by analysts at . Despite the plummeting revenue, however, user numbers exceeded analysts’ expectations. As of 6 January, the stock has plunged by more than 85% since the same date a year ago, mirroring a disastrous 12 months for cryptocurrency.. Can the stock claw back its value, and what is the latest Coinbase stock forecast? Here we take a look at what factors shape the crypto exchange’s share price forecasts in the current market environment. Coinbase went public on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange in April 2021 and initially traded above the early indicated price range at around $100, closing at $342 in the first session. The dropped to $224.35 a share in late May, coinciding with a cryptocurrency market , and then continued to follow the price trend, climbing to its peak of $368.90 in November when bitcoin ( ) climbed to its all-time high. The stock started 2022 at the $251 level, and continued to trend lower, closing at $103.74 on 6 May. The price then plummeted to $53.72 on 11 May, the day after the company weaker-than-expected first-quarter earnings. The move also coincided with the cryptocurrency ecosystem, which prompted a broader cryptocurrency The share price moved up to $78.10 on 31 May, but again pulled back, dropping to $47.02 by the end of June. The price rebounded to $75.27 on 20 July, before retreating to $52.93 on 26 July and then rallying to $98.02 on 8 August 2022, more than doubling the share price from the June low. The stock then dropped back to close at $87.68 on 9 August 2022, shedding more than 10% in the session. Coinbase’s second-quarter net revenue totalled $803m, down from $1.17bn in the previous quarter and $2.03bn in the second quarter of 2021. Net loss for the quarter totalled $1.09bn, up from a loss of $430m in the first quarter and compared with a net profit of $1.61bn in the second quarter of 2021. Coinbase noted that the total cryptocurrency market capitalisation declined by $1.3trn in the second quarter, around 60%, “primarily driven by macroeconomic conditions and shocks to the crypto credit environment.” On 3 November, Coinbase published its third-quarter for 2022. The Shareholder Letter stated: More recently, shares in Coinbase Global were down nearly 10% to $46.11, touching a new all-time low on 9 November following FTX’s collapse. As markets reeled, Coinbase, among other exchanges, has reaffirmed its commitment to keeping a safe hold on customer assets. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong that his company doesn’t lend customer funds and added: “Coinbase doesn’t have any material exposure to FTX or FTT (and no exposure to Alameda)”. Since then, though, the price has fallen as more people are avoiding cryptocurrency. What does that indicate for the Coinbase projected stock price in the coming years? The company noted in its shareholder letter that the cryptocurrency markets are cyclical. The average price target from 23 analysts who have issued a 12-month Coinbase stock forecast was $82.30, according to data compiled by as of 6 January 2023, with estimates ranging widely from a low of $30 to a high of $275. There were 10 ‘buy’ ratings, 10 ‘hold’ and four ‘sell’ recommendations.

As part of a strategic debt restructuring, the company said in a it is not ruling out “obtaining relief under the US Bankruptcy Code” BBBY among the so-called meme stock favourites, along with GameStop ( ) BlackBerry ( ), AMC Entertainment ( ) and a number of others. These were popularised by retail traders on online forums. The retailer’s persistently high debt levels and struggling balance sheet may put off some of these speculative traders. BBBY’s financials have been concerning for a while now. The company has built up $1.7bn in long term debt which it has been struggling to repay. This amount is double what it held in 2021. Its current debt to equity ratio is at around 6, while a healthy level is considered to be less than 2. The company's cash on hand peaked during the last quarter of 2020 at $1.3bn after which the levels have steeply declined to $13m by the end of 2022. It decided to partly finance its debt with a $376m short term loan from Sixth Street Partners in August 2022. BBBY has also attempted to lower its debt levels by issuing bonds before terminating the plan after not enough holders were interested in satisfying the issue’s conditions. Along with its stock, the company’s currently issued bonds maturing next year also dropped in price from 22 cents per USD to 12 cents. Its longer term bonds maturing in 2034 also fell from 10 cents to 6 cents. During the third quarter of 2022, BBBY’s net sales lowered by 32%. It cited “lower customer traffic and reduced levels of inventory availability” as the main reason behind this. President and CEO Sue Gove said “Despite more productive merchandise plans and improved execution, our financial performance was negatively impacted by inventory constraints as we partnered with our suppliers to navigate both micro- and macro- economic challenges.” While this may seem to be a reasonable challenge facing the company considering the current economic conditions, BBBY is unique in its inability to provide sufficient stock in recent months. Most retailers did not face an inventory shortage despite the rise in inflation. Despite these concerns with the company, there is a chance of retail investors holding up demand for the stock, like the trend that was seen after GameStop’s announcement of bankruptcy. However this time the fall in investor interest has affected all meme stocks, which may mean BBBY will not face the same post-bankruptcy announcement chaos as did. Research by Vanda Research lead by Iachini, Lucas Mantel and Giacomo Pierantoni there has been a sharp fall retail investment in the meme stock genre between 2021 and 2022. “Despite a jump in inflows during Q1 2022 and then later in the summer when retail traders attempted to make up for early losses by doubling down on these high-beta names, meme stocks saw retail purchases decidedly fall this year. The same holds when looking at these names' activity in the options market. We believe that large portfolio losses accumulated at the aggregate level are behind this drop in speculative behaviour. “Sure, we could still see occasional bursts of euphoria driven by tactical rebounds across some of the names in the meme world, but there must be a clear inversion of trend (i.e., aggregate turnover and equities up) to push this segment of investors to start trading heavily again.\" Markets in this article Rate this article Rate this article: Most traded Join the 610,000+ traders worldwide that chose to trade with Capital.com Contact us: CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs.

The world’s largest company by , which produces an innovative range of mobile phones and computers, has built up a ferociously loyal international customer base. But the California-based firm has seen its share price slump 30% over the past year due to a lack of enthusiasm for growth stocks, supply constraints and softer demand in China. In this Apple share price forecast we look at the company’s fundamentals, explore why the stock price has hit problems this year, and reveal the AAPL stock forecast of analysts. There’s no denying that Apple has become one of the business success stories of the past half a century and built up a phenomenally loyal customer base. The innovative business, which was founded back in the mid-1970s, is best known for its iPhones, with each new launch triggering a buying frenzy around the world. Its remarkable success has helped make Apple the world’s largest company, with a market capitalisation of $2.08tn – just ahead of Saudi Aramco and Microsoft ( ). Apple stock has been a . As of the third quarter of 2022, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway ( ) had . The first step in evaluating the Apple stock forecast is examining how the company’s stock has performed – and it’s fair to say investors in Apple have had an enjoyable five years, with the share price up 186%. The AAPL stock price has delivered a trailing return of 22.39% over the past 15 years, according to , as of 4 January 2023. This is ahead of the 20.31% achieved by the wider industry. Over the past year, the share price has been volatile. After hitting an all-time high of $180.73 on 3 January, 2022, the trend has been downwards. However, the performance over the past year has been more troubled, with the AAPL stock price having slumped 30% to $126.60 as the market closed on 4 January 2023. Apple also delighted the market in October 2022 by revealing a record of $90.1bn, with quarterly earnings per diluted share of $6.11, up 9% year over year. It also declared a cash of $0.23 a share of its common stock. According to Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, the results reflected the company’s commitment to its customers, the pursuit of innovation, and to leaving the world better than it was found. He said: “We are deeply committed to protecting the environment, to securing user privacy, to strengthening accessibility, and to creating products and services that can unlock humanity’s full creative potential.” Luca Maestri, Apple’s chief financial officer, insisted the results continued to demonstrate Apple’s ability to “execute effectively” in spite of a “challenging and volatile” macroeconomic backdrop. “We continued to invest in our long-term growth plans, generated over $24bn in operating cash flow, and returned over $29bn to our shareholders during the quarter,” he said. “The strength of our ecosystem, unmatched customer loyalty, and record sales spurred our active installed base of devices to a new all-time high. This quarter capped another record-breaking year for Apple, with revenue growing over $28bn and operating cash flow up $18bn versus last year.” iPhones were the top sellers during the , recording net sales of $42.6bn, compared to $38.8bn in the corresponding period of 2021. Mac computers weighed in with $11.5bn of net sales – up $2.3bn year-on-year, while iPad sales declined by just over $1bn to $7.2bn. Wearables, home and accessories contributed $9.6bn, compared to $8.8bn in the fourth quarter of 2021, while services increased $911m to $19.2bn. As far as regions were concerned, net sales increased in the Americas, Europe, Greater China and the rest of the Asia Pacific region during the quarter. However, they declined in Japan. It’s been a very tough year for Apple shareholders who will be looking for reassurance when the tech giant delivers its first quarter results, according to Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. “Apple stands in marked contrast to Meta, Amazon, Netflix, Google’s parent Alphabet and Microsoft, as it did not issue a profit warning or miss analysts’ expectations during calendar 2022,” he said. However, he believes a stronger dollar, a softer economy, competition, sagging consumer confidence, and supply chain disruption in China hurting iPhone 14 shipments as potential reasons behind the share price slump. Mould added: “Apple did grow its sales and earnings yet again in the last reported quarter, the three months to the end of September, (as) iPad sales stumbled once more, but wearables and accessories again performed strongly, and September’s launch of the iPhone 14 helped that revenue stream.” Mould pointed out that Apple’s market cap was an impressive $3trn at its peak – more than the gross domestic product ( ) of the UK – but has since lost $1trn from that figure, noting: “At the moment, all the stock has done is round-tripped back to late 2020, when central banks and governments were throwing cash at the economy in their fight to fend off the events of the pandemic and lockdowns.” Of course, the tech giant isn’t alone. “Apple has now joined Amazon in losing $1trn in market cap from its all-time high,” he said. “Meanwhile, Alphabet has shed $840bn, Microsoft $785bn, Meta Platforms $745bn and Netflix $174bn.” So, what are the Apple stock predictions of analysts? As of 5 January 2023, AAPL was a ‘strong buy’, based on the Apple stock predictions of 27 analysts compiled by as of 5 January. While 22 analysts believed AAPL was a ‘buy’, the remaining five gave it a ‘hold’ rating. No analyst rating suggested the stock should be sold. Their consensus Apple stock forecast 2023 was that the stock could rise to $176.70 over the coming year. The most optimistic believed it could hit $210, with the lowest prediction coming in at $140. However, the algorithmic forecasting of , as of 5 January, declared Apple was “a bad long-term (one year) investment”, with the AAPL stock price expected to fall to $108.77 over the next 12 months. The site’s Apple stock forecast 2025 put the price down to $73 by January 2025. Note that any analysts or algorithm-based AAPL stock forecast can be wrong and shouldn’t be used as a substitute for your own research. Always conduct your own due diligence before investing or trading. And never invest or trade money you cannot afford to lose. The company is a technology giant that makes products that are hugely popular around the world. The Apple share price has been strong over the past five years, but you must carry out your own analysis to decide if it’s likely to rise further in the future. And never invest or trade money you cannot afford to lose. This depends on a number of variables. It’s crucial to do your own research to form an opinion of Apple performance and likelihood of achieving analysts’ targets. You must also remember that markets are volatile and past performance is no indication of future returns. Whether AAPL stock is a suitable investment for you will depend on your personal research, trading strategy and investment needs. You need to perform your own due diligence and decide if the stock meets your needs and appetite for risk. And never invest or trade money you cannot afford to lose.

The business, which filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in September, has been struggling to recover from the enforced closures during the Covid-19 pandemic. In an update on 3 January 2023, the company revealed it would formally launch a sales process for all assets this month, alongside its ongoing capital restructuring. However, what does this mean for , and what are the prospects for the CINE stock price, which has fallen 88% from 32.68p to 3.83p over the past year? In this analysis, we take a look at who are the shareholders of Cineworld, examine the recent announcements made by management and ask analysts for their predictions. Cineworld, which was , established itself as one of the world’s leading cinema groups. Initially a private business, it re-registered as a public company in May 2006 and was listed on the London Stock Exchange ( ) a year later under the ticker CINE. In February 2018, Cineworld completed the $3.6bn acquisition of Regal Entertainment Group to complement its European cinema operations. As of January 2023, the company operated 751 sites and 9,189 screens in 10 countries, including the UK, US, Ireland, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania and Israel. Operations included 6,853 screens at 511 sites in the US under the Regal name. There were also 1,099 screens on 102 Cineworld sites, 1,014 screens on 102 Cinema City sites, 130 screens on 10 Planet sites and 93 screens on 26 Picturehouse locations. The company was owned by a mix of institutions, insiders and private investors. The top 25 Cineworld shareholders owned 55.17% of the business, according to as of 4 January. So, who owns the most shares of Cineworld? Well, there have been complications surrounding the list of Cineworld major shareholders, with in the company’s 2021 annual report. In a statement, the company clarified that its largest shareholder was the family of Moshe and Israel Greidinger, having reported it as being Global City Holdings, a Dutch holding company. It said: The definition of insider shareholders usually includes board members. Given the clarification issued by Cineworld – and the fact the trusts associated with the Greidingers account for around 20% of the company – it’s fair to put these family members as significant insiders. He has been chief since February 2014, having previously held the same role at Cinema City International. He has also held executive positions with the Cinema City Group since the mid 1980s. He is the deputy CEO of Cineworld. Although he joined the Board as chief operating officer in February 2014, his role changed to his current position six months later. Between 1994 and 2014, he worked for Cinema City International, where he was appointed CFO in 1995.

Here we take a look at what factors are shaping the Chevron stock forecast. Chevron Corporation is an American multinational energy company. The company’s predecessor, Pacific Coast Oil Co., was incorporated in San Francisco in 1879 and consolidated into Standard Oil Co by 1900. Although Chevron’s headquarter is in San Ramon, California, the New York Stock Exchange ( )-listed company operates oil and gas production facilities in the Americas, Australia, Asia, Africa and Europe.

For the most part of the last decade, investors chased new-age technology stocks and overlooked the energy sector, which was in the middle of an expensive transition to renewables. In 2022, energy stocks outperformed broader markets despite high and rising as elevated and helped these companies post record revenues and profits. Here we name some of the to watch and the energy sector outlook. Energy stocks refer to companies associated with the exploration, production and distribution of energy sources like crude oil, natural gas, coal and renewable fuels. The energy sector is crucial to the global economy. Without energy, cars will not run, factories will not function, devices will not turn on and the world would come to a standstill. Today the energy sector is at a crossroads. Industry insiders are working on new solutions to lower the dependence on fossil fuels. Global warming and climate change concerns and the limited of fossil fuels are driving innovation in the sector. Despite the leaps made over the years in the adoption of renewable power generation, our world still remains heavily dependent on oil, coal and natural gas. According to , non-renewable sources made up about 72% of global electricity production in 2021. The International Energy Agency (IEA) classified the primary sources of energy as oil, gas, coal, renewables and nuclear. There were two energy companies in the list of the top 10 largest companies in the world by , as of 3 January. Middle East energy juggernaut Saudi Aramco was the world’s second largest company valued at $1.887trn. US-based Exxon Mobil ( ) came in ninth at a market valuation of $454.24bn. If you are looking for the best energy stocks to buy in 2023, you will need to be aware of ongoing trends and developments in the sector. 2022 was a year that saw energy prices surge to multi-year highs following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Crude oil prices rose to trade over the $100 per barrel mark as the West imposed economic sanctions on Russia, one of the world’s top three crude producers. The natural gas market saw supply disruptions with European countries affected the most due to their over-dependence on Russia for gas imports. The high fuel prices and tight supply resulted in a “shock to the system” that had “far-reaching implications for households, businesses and entire economies”, . While consumers were the clear losers from the crisis, energy producers saw windfall profits in 2022. The agency added: Unsurprisingly, energy producers dominated the list of the most profitable companies in the world, taking up five spots in the top 10 compiled by on 3 January 2023. Saudi Aramco was the highest earner in the world above tech giants Apple ( ), Microsoft ( ) and Google ( ). Other energy companies on the list were New York-listed Equinor and Exxon Mobil (XOM), Anglo-Dutch energy major Shell ( ) and Brazil’s Petrobras ( ). Over the years, governments have come together to push for a green energy transition. Over 196 nations adopted a legally binding international treaty on climate change called the . The treaty aimed to “reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century”. Another significant deal for the energy sector was the signed in 2019 to lower greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. There is pressure from governments, activists and shareholders on energy firms to transform their business away from fossil fuels that are considered “dirty”. As pointed out by : Energy companies are investing billions to increase their share of renewable energy. The elevated energy prices and windfall profits seen in 2022 are expected to help fossil fuel companies in this expensive transition. When searching for the best energy stocks to watch in 2023, market participants can sort companies by the following criteria: Market capitalisation or market cap in simple words is the market valuation of a company which can be calculated by the share price multiplied by the number of shares. It is the total dollar market value of the number of outstanding shares of a security. Companies gain high market valuations based on their financial health, future prospects and upbeat . The revenue and earnings of energy companies are heavily dependent on the state of energy prices during the reporting period. As mentioned earlier, energy producers saw record revenue and profits in 2022 following a surge in energy prices. Market participants looking to invest in top energy stocks should note that energy prices are . Energy prices are dependent on global demand-supply dynamics. Leading oil-producing regions, like the US and OPEC+ nations, exert significant influence on energy prices. Energy companies spend enormous amounts of capital on exploration, drilling and production from new sources. These exploration projects are carried out based on geographical studies that may or may not lead to full realisation of expected results. Moreover, the transition of the sector to green energy sources has forced energy companies to invest in renewable energy. These initiatives are expensive and may require the company to take on debt. Market participants should monitor if a company’s debt is at sustainable levels. Financial metrics such as and ratios are useful. is an important standard that market participants should be aware of. ESG investing refers to investing only in those companies that meet a set of environmental, social and governance standards. For energy companies, environmental standards may refer to their commitment to reducing greenhouse emissions and increasing their share of renewables. Socially, it could also mean safeguarding the interest of the native population by drilling sites. Governance standards refer to a company’s management, internal controls and shareholder rights. In our top energy stocks list, we referred to the S&P 500 Energy Index. It consists of energy companies included in the US benchmark S&P 500 ( ). In 2022, all of the 23 components of the posted yearly gains underscoring investor preference for energy stocks amid elevated crude oil and natural gas prices during the year.

Financial services company expected conditions of tight energy supply and rising demand that helped the energy sector post a “strong year” in 2022 to continue in 2023. Maurice Fitzmaurice, sector portfolio manager at Fidelity said this was due to the long lead time to ramp up new supply and refining capacity: Elsewhere, expected the global energy mix to shift towards power, synfuels, and hydrogen rapidly and to make up 32% of the global energy mix by 2035 and 50% by 2050. The company said crude oil demand is projected to “decline rapidly” only after 2030. McKinsey said natural gas will play a “pivotal role throughout the transition by its wide range of applications” with its demand projected to peak by 2035.

People love to trade them and it’s a craze that has fascinated the investment world and benefitted some retail traders. But meme in 2022, AMC Entertainment ( ) stock plummeted 85% in 2022, GameStop Corp ( ) stock price fell 50% and Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY) shares dropped 82% last year. Expert Dr. Richard Smith, CEO of the investing tool , told Capital.com that if you choose to listen to investing advice on Reddit, then examine the risk. “If you want to trade meme stocks you should look at how long you want to hold for it - if you want to trade in this stock.” When it comes to meme stocks, Smith said “knowing when to sell before you buy” is key to risk management. That advice will come in handy right now for many retail traders because Meme stocks are in trouble. Back in August , which meant all shareholders would receive 1 share of AMC Preferred Equity Units (APE) for every share it held at the close of trading on 19 August 2022. 149 million AMC shares and 108 million APEs traded Monday on the NYSE. Exchange “halts” trading due to volatility, defined as a +/- 5% price change within a 5 minute period. If so, trading is stopped for a 5-minute pause. On Monday, AMC was halted 3 times, APE halted 10 times! This was like a stock split, it technically didnt dilute the shares but did dilute the price and was put in place to raise cash. However, failed to raise enough cash, as APE units have fallen from a high of $7.02 on 23 August 2022 to $1.20 on 3 January 2023, losing 80% of their value. Last month, a new $110m (£91m) capital raise to reduce its debt load and planned a new proposed reverse stock split, through the sale of APE units. shares plummeted by 7% on the day of the announcement – 22 December. The reverse stock split has yet to be approved by shareholders, and experts are concerned that shareholders will not approve more dilution in price or shares. But, will shareholders start to lose patience with its CEO? Aaron has himself sold over $40m worth of his shares over the last two years. Well, it would seem has some upside. The cinema chain announced on 19 December that since the inception of its APE, AMC has strengthened its liquidity position and raised $162.4m of gross cash proceeds before fees and commissions, via the sale of 125.9 million AMC Preferred Equity Units (APE). also announced last month it had seen a revenue increase on the opening weekend of the new movie, Avatar: The Way of Water. But still has its work cut out for it in 2023. With video streaming increasing and the fact they are operating in what some would call a dying industry, means it will need to up its game in 2023. is also facing a tough time right now.

Last year, Furlong launched an ambitious turnaround plan that would mean cutting staff to lower operating costs. But some analysts are less than impressed with the stock. Wedbush analyst, Michael Pachter lowered his price target for to $5.30 from $6 and has maintained an ‘underperform’ rating on shares. The home retailer, BBBY had a confusing 2022. A US college student caused a meme stock frenzy last year after he purchased almost 5 million shares in Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) in July for less than $5.50 and saw the struggling furniture group's price surge. The popular meme stock has been plagued by and a senior manager dying by suicide. On 2 November, it was announced that BBBY board's chief customer officer, Rafeh Masood, was the latest to leave the embattled retailer. Massod was also the chief technology officer. In June the BBBY board pushed out chief executive Mark Tritton and chief merchandising officer Joe Hartsig. Investors may be asking - what next for BBBY stock? The company is hoping that under the leadership of its new CEO, Sue Grove, who took over in June from ousted leader Tritton, things will turn around. But the company is still plagued by supply chain issues and inventory woes. Experts are also concerned that bankruptcy is on the cards. With discretionary consumer spending on the decline due to rising inflation and interest rate hikes, retail stocks like BBBY are already having a difficult time as it is.

This is not what has happened at Ferrexpo ( ). The arrest has, but the share collapse hasn't – things in foreign are in foreign, d'ye see? As : “ The billionaire majority owner of London-listed iron ore pellet producer Ferrexpo has been arrested at a ski resort over $100m [£83m] embezzlement allegations in Ukraine.” So the arrest part is indeed true. But why hasn't that share price moved? Numbers of reasons come to mind. We've known about the allegations for a long time. There's a war on and this isn't as important as that. It's not the CEO, which makes a difference. This is not, not at all, to comment on any particular case you understand, but allegations of criminality don't have quite the same meaning in some foreign places. There are places where such allegations – even to the point of the issuance of an arrest warrant – are merely the local business manner of fluffing your hair and wishing you a good morning. The no-smoke-without-fire equation doesn't work the same way. This being the actual point of this piece here. We cannot – well, cannot and still make money – judge business actions elsewhere by our own cultural standards. This also means that any particular set of profits needs to be judged by those local standards, not by ours. Because these foreigners have their own ways, see? I've mentioned before how Petropavlovsk (POG) has been terminally shafted by this. As a London listed company it had to play by London rules. But doing so drove it into bankruptcy. Sanctions meant it couldn't pay its bank loan by delivering gold, also it couldn't pay off the loan so it didn't have to deliver gold. Err? Hello Mr. Receiver, Sir. The rules didn't allow any other outcome although a certain more foreign attitude to rules could have done. Polymetal (POLY) doesn't have that problem but suffers from a slightly different interaction of the rules. But we've still got to value POLY on the basis of those rules, don't we? It's also possible to run this the other way around. Those rules create arbitrages which we may or may not be able to cross. The one that really irritates me is Norilsk (MNOD). The listed ADR isn't trading right now but it might be possible to find some on the grey market. For the Moscow price is vastly higher, multiples. But as a foreigner you can't sell Russian shares in Russia. Also, it's not even possible to get ownership recognised for many – the share registration systems no longer talk to each other. I know corrupt people in Russia and also bankers in Russia – to the extent that I'm not repeating myself – and I can't work out a way around that either. Sigh. That idea of being a criminal mastermind does seem to fail at the intelligence level rather than the moral. The point here though is not to try to suggest trades. It is, rather, to point out that the rules elsewhere are not what we might expect at home. British law used to state that bribery here at home was appalling, jail for you, Sir. Bribery abroad, well, it depended where. If it was a normal part of business there then off you go. It might even be tax-deductible. I checked this once and really, it used to be. There was, for example, a case of a London listed company with a mine way out wherever. The company was found to be paying the university fees (somewhere expensive in the US) of the son of the local police chief. In order to ensure that there were no local problems. This caused a scandal when revealed. Everyone who knew the country, me included, was thinking, well, umm, yes, and? That's just the way it's done here. I've even been known to mutter that it's colonialism to insist that everyone else run their world the way we do. But again, the domestic politics is not really the point here. What matters is that London is an international market. So, many of the shares will be involved in foreign activities. We know, after all, that 75% of the FTSE 100 revenue comes from outside the British economy. So, 75% of the business must be being done under those foreign rules. What this means is that when something happens in foreign it might not have the same effect as something that was alleged, or happened, domestically. To be silly about this: drug dealing in the UK is a crime, yet Britain – twice – went to war so that a British company could continue to deal drugs in foreign. No, really. The point we should draw from this is that news of something in foreign doesn't have the same effect it might do if the same thing were alleged at home. It does depend upon which foreign country, of course. So, when we get some news of something that has happened out there then we need to think about where it has come from. And, well, what does this mean out there, by their standards? If the domestic issue is, by those domestic standards, no big thing, then perhaps we'd best not consider it large by our investing standards? Of course, it's also possible to view that entirely the other way around. If we think of what some places do think of the local business manner of fluffing your hair and welcoming you to the morning then perhaps those are places we simply don't want to be involved. But the same basic point remains. Foreign is foreign, they do things different there. So, how much different are we happy with is an important point to consider.

It’s time that we right these wrongs,” noted President Biden. New York its first legal dispensary for recreational marijuana in December 2022.

On the international stage, became the first Asian nation to decriminalise cannabis in June 2022, giving life to a booming weed tourism industry almost overnight. On the medicinal front, there are several cannabinoid-based pharmaceuticals that have been approved by regulators and are available in a number of countries. Epidiolex, an oral CBD solution, became the first drug to contain an active ingredient derived from cannabis to be approved by the in 2018 for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy. The FDA has also approved synthetic-THC drugs Marinol and Syndros for therapeutic uses in the US for treating anorexia associated with weight loss in AIDS patients.

The stock, which is listed on the Australian Stock Exchange ( ) has fallen by 5.7% in the past year, but has gained 23.3% since 10 November. Will the BRN stock price continue to rebound, or is it set to pull back again? In this article, we look at the company and some of the latest BrainChip stock predictions. BrainChip Holdings was founded in July 2004 in Australia. It is expert in AI, semiconductor design, software development and technology, with teams in California, France, India, and Australia. The company is developing computing edge AI on-chip processing and learning. Edge AI combines AI with edge computing – data processing done on site or nearby to reduce the need for processing capacity in a remote data centre. “BrainChip’s first-to-market neuromorphic processor IP, Akida™, mimics the human brain to analyse only essential sensor inputs at the point of acquisition – processing data with unparalleled efficiency, precision, and economy of energy. Keeping AI/ML local to the chip and independent of the cloud dramatically reduces latency while improving privacy and data security,” according to the company’s . Edge devices with AI are predicted to become a $70bn market by 2025. BrainChip Holdings on the ASX in November 2011. The company was incorporated in the US as BrainChip Inc. in 2013. The two entities and the company was reinstated on the ASX in September 2015. The BrainChip share price reached a closing high of A$1.76 a share on 21 January 2022 and after a dip approached that high again to close at A$1.74 on 4 February. The development of AI-related technology – such as autonomous vehicles, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, robotics and drones – accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic, increasing the attractiveness of BrainChip’s stock for investors. But the BRN stock price fell to A$0.91 by mid-April, as technology stocks sold off under pressure from rising inflation and interest rates, and then bounced up to A$1.17 in May. The stock retreated to A$0.84 on 1 July and saw one more spike above A$1.18 later in the month before turning lower. The share price dropped from A$0.85 on 27 October to A$0.67 on 28 October, after BrainChip warned of the impact of the technology sector slowdown: The company announced that it ended the September quarter with US$24.6m in cash, down from $28.4m at the end of the second quarter but up from $23.9m in the third quarter of 2021. Operating cash flow rose to $3.8m from $2.8m in the previous quarter. BrainChip’s revenue from customers totalled $100,000, down from $1.2m in the second quarter but unchanged year on year. The stock fell to A$0.62 on 4 November. It then began to make gains, reaching A$0.74 at the end of December. BrainChip has partnerships with some of the world’s biggest semiconductor chip producers, with Renesas a chip using BrainChip’s spiking neural network (SNN) technology and BrainChip the Intel Foundry Services (IFS) ecosystem alliance in December. “Partners in this alliance collaborate with IFS to enable designers to access high-quality IPs, supporting their design needs and project schedule, while optimising for performance, power and area,” according to the announcement. Will this opportunity help to drive the BrainChip share price higher? Where is the stock likely to trade in the year ahead? What is a realistic BrainChip stock forecast for investors to consider? The short-term BrainChip stock forecast from data analytics service indicated that the share price could fall further: “Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to fall -24.00% during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between A$0.353 and A$0.570 at the end of this 3-month period. Do note, that if the stock price manages to stay at current levels or higher, our prediction target will start to change positively over the next few days as the conditions for the current predictions will be broken.” Technical analysis from at the time of writing (3 January) suggested that the stock was a buy, with the simple and exponential moving averages out to 50 days showing bullish signals, along with the volume weighted moving average and Hull moving average. The moving average convergence divergence ( ) showed a buy signal, while the relative strength index ( ) was neutral. For the longer term, at the time of writing the BrainChip share price forecast from machine learning/AI analytics site showed that the stock could average A$0.70 by 2025. That would be down from its BrainChip stock forecast for 2023 of A$1.26. The share price could drop further to A$0.39 by 2030, the prediction indicated. However, the BrainChip stock forecast for 2025 from algorithm-based forecasting service projected that the share price could rise to A$1.777 by the end of the year, up from A$1.071 at the end of 2023. Its BRN stock forecast suggested that the price could continue rising to reach $2.438 by December 2027. When consulting any BRN stock forecast it’s important to keep in mind that algorithm-based predictions are calculated based on past performance and historical data and you should exercise caution. As such, forecasters can and do get their predictions wrong. You should do your own research and consider market trends, demand and market scope for emerging technology, the company’s latest news and fundamentals. Always remember that your decision to trade depends on your attitude to risk, your expertise in the market, your investment portfolio diversification, and how comfortable you feel about losing money. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Whether BRN is a good stock for your portfolio depends on your risk tolerance, portfolio composition and investing strategy. Always do your own research. Remember that past performance is no guarantee of future success. The direction of the BRN share price will likely depend on the adoption of its edge AI technology as well as overall market sentiment on technology stocks and other asset prices, among other factors.

At the end of December 2022, the company started production of a new generation of advanced semiconductor chips, having expanded the capacity at its factory in Taiwan. It is also building additional capacity in Taiwan, Japan and in Arizona in the US. The has rebounded from its 52-week low reached in November, but remains down by around 42% over the past year as technology stocks have come under pressure from bearish stock market sentiment. What are the prospects for the stock in 2023? Will the share price make further gains or turn lower? TSMC was established in 1987 by former Texas Instruments executive Morris Chang as the world's first dedicated semiconductor chip foundry. It has grown to become one of the largest companies in Taiwan. TSMC produces chips for the likes of AMD ( ), Nvidia ( ), Broadcom ( ) and Apple ( ), as well as companies that also produce their own chips, like Intel ( ), NXP ( ) and Texas Instruments ( ). TSMC listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in 1993. In 1997, it became the first Taiwanese company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( ). In 2021, the company had an annual production capacity of more than 13m 12-inch equivalent wafers, produced across its plants in Taiwan, China and the US. TSMC is due to complete its new plants in Japan and the US in 2024. The TSM stock price reached an all-time closing high of NT$672 a share on the Taiwan Stock Exchange and $140.66 per share on the New York Stock Exchange on 14 January. That was up by more than 200% since March 2020 at the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. The company benefited from a strong demand cycle and supply chain constraints for semiconductors in automotive, consumer devices, data centres and other applications. However, as economies around the world slowed in 2022, supply chains became oversupplied and inventories have built up. With technology stocks under pressure in 2022 and expectations rising that major economies will face recession in 2023, TSMC’s share price has not been immune to decline. The stock trended lower to reach $75.56 on the NYSE and $435.50 on the TSE in early July, but then moved up to $91.57 and NT$527 in mid-August, buoyed by optimism that the US Federal Reserve ( ) would slow the pace of hikes that have weighed on financial markets. However, subsequent high readings indicated that interest rate hikes could continue, and the TSMC share price on the NYSE fell to $60.28 on 3 November. With stocks moving off the lows, the share price rose to $82.98 on 30 November. On the TSE, the stock bottomed out at NT$371 on 25 October and rose to NT$498.50 on 1 December. The gains moderated in December, and TSMC ended 2022 at $74.49 a share on the US market and NT$448.50 on the TSE. For the third quarter ended 30 September, TSMC announced of NT$613.14bn, a 47.9% year-on-year increase and a 79.7% jump in net income to NT$280.87bn. “Our third quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5nm technologies,” said TSMC’s Wendell Huang, vice president and CFO. In US dollar terms, third-quarter revenue increased by 35.9% year on year to $20.23bn. The company its fourth-quarter revenue to range between $19.9bn and $20.7bn, with an operating profit margin between 49% and 51%. On 6 December, TSMC announced a significant expansion to its investment in Arizona, adding a second fabrication plant. The company now expects to invest $40bn in the site, up from the $12bn it announced in 2020. What is the outlook for the share price for the new year? Below, we look at some of the latest Taiwan Semiconductor stock predictions from analysts. The average 12-month price target for TSMC’s US shares from nine Wall Street analysts that have issued a Taiwan Semiconductor stock forecast was $116.57 a share at the time of writing, according to data compiled by . Estimates ranged between $75 at the low end and a high of $170. Analysis by Singapore-based OCBC on 24 November estimated fair value for the NYSE-listed stock at $118. According to the bank’s TSM stock forecast: “Despite near-term headwinds from an inventory glut and weakening end-demand in the semiconductor industry, we believe the business should be relatively resilient on the back of relatively higher priced 3nm wafer production by the end of FY22 and from its customers gaining share in leading-edge market.” For the Taiwan-listed stock, analysts at Daiwa Capital Markets reiterated their buy rating on 22 December, with a Taiwan Semiconductor share price forecast of NT$655 per share indicating an upside of 40.4%. “We believe TSMC will be counter-cyclical in terms of YoY revenue growth, navigating well through the 2023 chip correction while enjoying a lift in structural profitability above its pre-Covid level on value redistribution to the upstream of the supply chain,” the analysts wrote in a note to clients. Analysts at J.P. Morgan have a similar Taiwan Semiconductor stock forecast for 2023 of NT$650 per share, based on 15 times the company’s 12-month earnings per share, “slightly lower than the 10-year average multiple of 16x due to the ongoing semiconductor industry downturn cycle”, according to a research note on 7 December. Back in October, the Taiwan Semiconductor stock forecast from Morningstar analyst Phelix Lee suggested that TSMC shares were undervalued based on the potential for long-term computing growth, despite an uncertain 24 months ahead. For the longer term, the Taiwan Semiconductor stock forecast for 2025 for TSMC’s US-listed stock from algorithm-based forecaster projected that the share price could rise to $126.719 by the end of the year, up from $90.89 at the end of 2023. Are you looking to invest in or trade TSMC’s shares based on TSM stock forecasts? Remember that financial markets are very volatile, and analysts and algorithm-based forecasters can and do get their predictions wrong. It is crucial that you always do your own research.

Although energy transition move brighten prospects for a boost in EV demand. But, tailwinds, such as the company’s inclusion in the Russell 2000 ( ) and indices, have failed to cushion the fall. In mid- , Mullen announced it had picked Randy Marion Automotive Group as its first US dealer partner for the company’s commercial EV lineup. Will the partnership with one of the largest commercial auto dealer groups in the US help the Mullen Automotive stock price recover from the slump? In this article we take a look at the latest Mullen Automotive stock news and other factors that may shape a Mullen Automotive stock forecast. Headquartered in Southern California, Mullen Automotive (MULN) manufactures and distributes EVs. The company was founded in 2014 as , the result of a merger between CODA Automotive and Mullen Motor Cars. CODA was a manufacturer of all-electric sedans, and for a time was one of the only two certified companies selling EVs in the US – the other being Elon Musk’s Tesla ( ). The firm became in November 2021, following a reverse merger with Net Element. As a result, Mullen Automotive became a public company, officially in November 2021 under the ticker symbol MULN. The company’s main product is the all-electric sport utility vehicle (SUV) , which was released on 17 November 2021. It is in the process of launching the all-electric sports car, DragonFly. In addition, the company plans to design, customise and manufacture multi classes of commercial electric cargo vans at its Tunica plant. Mullen is also developing a 150 kilowatt-hour that it hopes will power its Mullen Five EV. If the battery proves to be successful, the vehicle will be able to travel more than 600 miles on only one fully charged battery. Since its debut in November 2021 as the surviving post-merger company with Net Element (NETE), the MULN stock value has been in decline. Soaring fuel prices since last year, which raised the prospect of higher demand for EVs, have done little to stem the drop in MULN’s stock price. Mullen Automotive reported $99m worth of cash or cash equivalents on its balance sheet, according to the company’s preliminary published on 8 August. According to the report, the company’s total assets grew 391%, primarily driven by cash from financing activities along with increased property and equipment. It reported positive working capital of $27.66m and financial commitments of $318m, positioning the company for growth in 2022 and 2023. Despite a slew of positive news, such as successful test results by Indiana’s Battery Innovation Center (BIC) on Mullen’s solid-state battery and the stock’s inclusion on Russell indices, the Mullen Automotive stock price hasn’t shown any signs of recovery. The passing of the Inflation Reduction Act by the US Senate on 7 August, which could be a tailwind that EV manufacturers need, did not improve sentiment on the Mullen Automotive stock price. According to the “ ”, the bill provides incentives that may benefit EV producers like Mullen Automotive. The incentives include a $10bn investment tax credit to build clean technology manufacturing facilities, including for the production of EV, wind turbines and solar panels. It also offers up to $20bn loans to build new, clean vehicle manufacturing facilities. In recent Mullen Automotive stock news, the company announced it picked Randy Marion Automotive Group (RMA) as its first dealer group partner for Mullen’s commercial EV lineup. The company commercial EV lineup includes Class 1-3 cargo van and cab chassis offerings and Bollinger Motors Class 4-6 chassis products, which are set to be launched in 2023. Following the partnership deal, on Mullen announced that it had received a purchase order for 6,000 Class 1 EV cargo vans from Randy Marion Isuzu, LLC, a member of RMA. The order is valued at approximately $200m and the first delivery is expected in the first quarter of 2023. The deal with RMA topped previous Mullen EV purchase deals. In , Mullen announced an agreement with DelPack Logistics, an Amazon Delivery Services Partner, to purchase up to 600 Mullen Class 1 and 2 EV cargo vans over the next 18 months. Will the agreement with Randy Marion raise Mullen Automotive stock forecast? Algorithm-based forecasting service was bearish in its Mullen Automotive stock predictions, noting that the stock was a bad long-term investment. The service’s Mullen Automotive stock forecast for 2023 projected that the stocks would remain below $1 per share.

Strong earnings reported in October have clashed with continued stutters in its target growth markets amid Covid-19 lockdowns, compounding heavy losses in share value this year. Will a creative change at stalwart Gucci help jolt the company’s share price back to life, or will macro headwinds, as well as a PR blunder at Balenciaga, keep the company subdued next year? Here we take a look at what factors are shaping and beyond. Kering is a luxury fashion group that operates across the globe. Founded by François Pinault as timber trading company Établissements Pinault in 1963, the group made a shift towards luxury in 1999 when it bought a , now a cornerstone of the company’s business. The company went public after an initial public offering ( ) placed it on the Paris Stock Exchange on 25 October 1988. Its main subsidiaries include Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga. It directly operated more than 1500 stores at the end of 2021, around half of which were in emerging countries. The company makes most of its income from the luxury sector, bringing in revenues of nearly €18 billion in 2021. Kering has slowly added more luxury fashion houses to its portfolio over the last two decades through a series of acquisitions, the last being for jewellery brands Pomellato and DoDo in 2013. has historically been driven by cyclical economic factors, with the luxury fashion group vulnerable to events that might affect , similar to the wider retail sector. Kering stock forecasts tend to track macro factors, but it has also been driven by internal growth. The stock saw its biggest appreciation in 2017 during an exceptional individual year for sales, with Gucci’s growth five times higher than the rest of the luxury retail industry. The group saw its share price peak in August 2021 at €788.90, as the brand benefited from strong sales growth within a wider — both of which were linked to heavy following Covid-19 restrictions and the downstream of huge government stimulus. Kering stock is down 32.8% this year as a hurts confidence across the globe. The context of high and rising has brought particular scepticism towards sectors reliant on discretionary spending, explaining contractions in value seen across Kering’s competitors, data as of 30 December showed. Recent Kering stock news has been somewhat more troubling, with a blunder at Balenciaga — in which the group ran advertisements showing children holding teddy bears in bondage gear — helping to offset good gains experienced in the wake of a strong earnings report. The stock closed on 29th December at €482.60, a 1.3% rise over the day. In a , the brand admitted it had made a collection of “grievous errors” which led it to run highly controversial ads. While the company’s share price has weathered some turbulence this year, underlying fundamentals appear to be strong. But there are signs that economic pressures could be starting to cut through. The company beat analysts’ expectations for the , according to analysis from , with currency-adjusted sales growth of 14%. Sales growth of 9% at the company’s biggest revenue generator, Gucci, was below the 11% consensus, disappointing analysts, according to . Kering's finance chief Jean-Marc Duplaix said in a webcast that Gucci’s performance in China had been mixed and \"has yet to normalise”, a reminder of consumption issues in the country linked to Covid-19. Indeed, this “mixed” performance contributed to Asia Pacific’s share of total group revenue falling by 2 percentage points compared with the same period last year, as other regions succeeded in emerging out of Covid-19 restrictions. There are plenty of headwinds for Kering to be wary of as it enters 2023. Chief among them will be inflation and its downstream effects on the economy. Consumer prices rose by 7.1% in November 2022, which, while showing signs of a slowdown, is still well above the US Federal Reserve’s ( ) 2% target. It has been a similar story in Kering’s other markets across Europe and Asia, resulting in across the world hiking interest rates. Thankfully for Kering, luxury brands tend to be more resilient to inflationary pressures. Sean painted a picture of a sector that was relatively immune to price rises, with a specific Chanel bag rising 60% in the space of a year, leaving demand relatively unencumbered. However, Burke added that economic headwinds could push middle-class buyers back out of the luxury market. Meanwhile, the company's growth in Asia has been a boon in recent years, helping it add organic revenue by breaking into a market that was previously largely untapped. But that growth has also been hampered by China’s halting emergence out of Covid-19. News from China remained mixed. While it is beginning to loosen Covid-19 restrictions, it faces a wave of new cases that may threaten Kering’s business there. China has already forced factories owned by Apple ( ) and Tesla ( ) to temporarily cease production in the country, while Nomura research found lockdowns were affecting more than 12% of the country’s economy. Recent operational news at Kering involved a change in management. Gucci Alessandro Michele would be stepping down as the brand’s creative director. In the current context, at least some analysts regard this as good news. In a note shared with Capital.com Barclays’ head of European luxury research Carole Madjo wrote: The biggest immediate headwind facing Kering though is the scandal that rocked Balenciaga through November. The move forced internet mogul Kim Kardashian to say she was with Balenciaga after the fallout, delivering a blow to the company’s reputation and potentially its revenue. I have been quiet for the past few days, not because I haven’t been disgusted and outraged by the recent Balenciaga campaigns, but because I wanted an opportunity to speak to their team to understand for myself how this could have happened. In another note on the Kering share price forecast shared with Capital.com, Barclays’ Madjo wrote that a lack of momentum of the Gucci brand and the sense of brand fatigue which was particularly visible in China had forced the bank to cut its rating for Kering from Over Weight to Equal Weight (EW). She said: The analyst added that in the Western market, Gucci could suffer from macro headwinds more than its peers, “considering that it is perceived as a more seasonal brand”. Madjo noted; In its annual , McKinsey highlighted some of the strengths of the Kering brand and its expansion to the east. “In luxury, Kering made an impressive rise through the ranks, driven by Gucci’s double-digit sales growth and strong performance in Asia–Pacific markets such as Japan,” the group wrote. Optimism around the Kering brand is echoed by analysts providing price targets in the last couple of months, all of whom put upside on the value of the company. Based on 12 analysts’ outlooks in the last 12 months as of 30 December, the KER stock price was expected to be €627.17 next year. That represented a 31.6% upside on closing levels on 29 December. The upside of that range of Kering stock forecasts for 2023 was a €785 target by Morgan Stanley at the start of 2022. The most optimistic KER stock forecast delivered since the company’s latest earnings report came from Goldman Sachs, where analyst Louise Singlehurst pinned a €690 price target for 2023, 32% upside at time of forecast. The lowest price expected by an analyst was a €555 target, a 1.33% upside at the time of Kering stock prediction prior to December’s tumble. A Kering stock forecast for 2025 by algorithm-based forecasting service as of 30 December suggested the stock will close out that year at €523.27. Note that analysts and algorithm-based KER stock forecasts can be wrong and shouldn’t be used as a substitute for your own research. Always conduct your own due diligence before trading, looking at the latest news, a wide range of commentary, and . Keep in mind that past performance does not guarantee future returns. And never trade money you cannot afford to lose. Kering appears to have some upside based on analyst targets compiled by as of 30 December, owing to strong potential in Asia Pacific after a challenging couple of years. But inflation, a potential recession and stuttered reopening in China pose risks. Remember, whether Kering is an appropriate investment for you would depend on your risk tolerance, experience in the stock market, portfolio goals and overall . Always conduct your own research before trading as analyst views may be wrong. Based on 12 analysts’ outlooks in the last 12 months, as compiled by as of 30 December, the KER stock price was expected to be €627.17 next year. The highest forecast delivered for Kering stock was a price target of €785 from Morgan StanleyMnv mmm. The lowest price expected by an analyst was a €555 target. Whether Kering is an appropriate investment for you would depend on your risk tolerance, experience in the stock market, portfolio goals and overall strategy. Kering stock forecast is dependent on the path of several macroeconomic factors including inflation and interest rates, as well as internal decisions made by the company, particularly as Gucci looks for a new creative director.

", "title_link": "https://capital.com/ibm-stock-price-forecast", "published_date": "08:38, 31 December 2022", "author": " Nicole Willing", "Description": "By US technology company ( ) is one of only a few companies in the sector with a high market to provide investors a positive return on its share price in 2022, as the Nasdaq Technology Index ( ) ends its worst year since 2008. The has gained 2.9% for the year, while the Nasdaq 100 has plunged by more than 35%. The 111-year-old company has not been the hottest of tech stocks in recent years, but in 2022, with and rising, geopolitical uncertainty and the prospects for a global recession looming, investors have turned to IBM for its stability. Is the stock likely to remain a safe haven for investors in 2023? In this article, we look at some of the latest IBM stock predictions from analysts. IBM was founded in 1911 in New York through the of several companies that were developing business transaction automation. The company was initially called Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR), and was renamed International Business Machines in 1924. IBM developed its Model 360 mainframe computer in the 1960s, building computers and software for the Apollo space missions. The company has also been involved in the development of speech recognition technology, the first computer-driven airline reservation system, the magnetic swipe strip on cards, floppy disks, supermarket barcodes and LASIK surgery, as well as personal computers and supercomputers. IBM has topped the US patent list for the last three decades, receiving more patents than any other US company. IBM initially struggled to keep pace with the emergence of personal computers, but focused on high-margin products and soon returned to profitability. IBM sold its PC division to Lenovo ( ) in 2005. Today, the company manufactures and sells hardware, and also provides middleware and operating systems software, strategic outsourcing, maintenance services, cloud technology, business consulting, and financing. IBM has operations in 171 countries around the world. The company is nicknamed “Big Blue”, in part because of its blue logo and partly because it had a dress code of white shirts with blue suits in the past. IBM’s shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( ) and the Chicago Stock Exchange. It is one of 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ), an index of 30 large US blue chip companies. The IBM stock price reached its peak above $200 in March 2013. The stock then declined as the company’s trailing 12-month revenue trended lower from more than $100bn until 2020, when it dropped by almost half during Covid-19 lockdowns. The share price fell to $91.11 a share in March 2020, from $146.53 a month earlier. The stock has recovered gradually from the drop, returning to the $140 level in June 2021 before retreating to $115.81 in November last year. The share price has climbed from $136.05 at the start of 2022 back to the $140 level, having dipped to $117.57 in October before its latest rally to $150.57 on 13 December. Inflation at four-decade highs, soaring energy prices and an aggressive pace of interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve ( ) as well as other have weighed heavily on growth stocks such as technology companies, in favour of less volatile stocks in established companies that are viewed as more stable during recessions. Consumer technology companies that benefited from Covid-19 lockdowns have fallen out of favour as restrictions have been removed, whereas companies like IBM that are focused on business-facing trends in digitalisation, cloud computing and the adoption of artificial intelligence have benefits. IBM tends to be viewed as a value rather than growth stock, and offers an attractive 4.71% dividend yield with a history of 23 years of consecutive payments for income-focused investors. In the third quarter ended 30 September, IBM revenue of $14.1bn, which was up by 6% year-on-year, and revised up its full-year revenue guidance to above its model for mid-single digit growth. It reported a net loss for the quarter of $3.2bn, compared with a net income of $1.03bn in the third quarter of 2021. Its year-to-date loss totalled $1.07bn, from a net income of $2.25bn in the nine months ended 30 September 2021. IBM is in the midst of a turnaround led by chief executive officer (CEO) Arvind Krishna’s plan to focus on artificial intelligence and hybrid cloud computing along with professional services. Krishna on the company’s quarterly earnings call: At the time of writing, analysis by stock data provider showed that IBM stock was trading 25.4% below its fair value estimate for the company, and earnings were forecast to grow by 70.8% per year. However, its risk analysis showed that the company’s debt and dividend are not well covered by operating cash flow, large one-off items are affecting its financial results and at 2.3%, profit margins are lower than last year’s 4.6%. Will IBM’s stock continue to provide positive returns for investors amid market volatility? Below, we look at some of the latest analyst projections for an IBM stock price forecast. At the time of writing, the consensus from analysts indicated that IBM was a buy, but consensus price targets implied that there was little further upside left for the share price, which could stabilise over the next year. The average 12-month price target from eight Wall Street analysts that have issued an IBM share price forecast was $139.40 a share, little changed from its current level, according to data compiled by . Estimates ranged between $11 at the low end and a high of $155 a share. Four of the analysts rated the stock a buy, while three recommended holding and one recommended selling the stock. On 20 October, following the third quarter results release, analysts at Credit Suisse cut their IBM stock forecast to $155 from $158 with an outperform rating and UBS analysts lowered their target slightly to $111 from $112, while analysts at Evercore ISI raised their forecast to $135 from $125 a share. Analysts at Morgan Stanley left their IBM stock forecast unchanged at $152 on 20 October, writing in a note to clients: “In our view, it's hard to poke many holes in the 3Q report and the better than feared quarter is illustrative of IBM's improved business mix, higher recurring revenue base, and late-cycle defensibility.

The video gaming industry – which many had considered a recession-proof sector – is starting to show signs of weakness in decreasing discretionary spending from US consumers. Several game developers including and rival Take-Two Interactive Software ( ) lowered their annual sales forecast in anticipation of a demand drop. How will the Electronic Arts stock price fare in 2023? In this article, we take a look at the company’s recent results, historical stock price performance and the Electronic Arts stock forecast for 2023 and beyond. Electronic Arts is a digital interactive entertainment company that develops, markets, publishes and delivers games, content and services on game consoles, PCs, mobile phones and tablets. The company’s gaming portfolio includes brands that are wholly-owned such as and , or licensed from others such as and . In the , revenue from consoles accounted for about 65% of the company’s quarterly net revenue. PC, mobile and others made up the rest of its quarterly net revenue by platform. By region, international markets accounted for nearly 57% of EA’s net revenue. North America accounted for the remaining 43% of its quarterly revenue. The company also classifies its revenue into two categories: Full game and live services. Full-game revenues include digital sales of game downloads across all platforms, software licensing revenue and physically sold packaged goods. Live services include revenue from sales of extra content for games, subscription offerings, advertising and non-software licensing. In the September quarter of 2022, live services contributed over 68% of EA’s quarterly net revenue. Full games accounted for about 31% of quarterly net revenue. Two major drivers for the video-gaming industry in the post-pandemic era have been the gaming companies benefiting from stay-at-home restrictions, and a sector-wide consolidation via mergers and acquisitions. Microsoft’s (MSFT) mammoth $69.7bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard (ATVI) made Microsoft the world’s number-one gaming company by market capitalisation, ahead of and , according to . In February 2022, Tokyo-headquartered Sony Group ( ) followed suit with a $3.6bn deal to buy Bungie, the creator of Halo video games. With Microsoft’s Xbox and Sony’s Playstation dominating the gaming-console business, industry experts expect Electronic Arts to be the “hot commodity” on the market due to “the appeal of EA’s strong video-game library”, to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Amine Bensaid. In late-August 2022, there were rumours suggesting that tech giant Amazon ( ), which owns popular game streaming platform Twitch, was planning to make an acquisition bid for Electonics Arts. EA stock price jumped 3.6% on 26 August on the news. However, a media report from quickly quashed the rumour. While Activision Blizzard has outperformed its industry rivals by gaining over 13% in 2022 on the back of its acquisition by Microsoft, Electronics Arts has not seen any concrete acquisition-related tailwind to help its stock price appreciate in 2022. As of December 2022, there has been no further development on the Amazon acquisition rumour. Increased competition, easing stay-at-home restrictions and the flop of its flagship game Battlefield 2042 dragged EA stock value by nearly 10% in 2022. Along the way, EA stock hit a one-and-half-year low of about $109 in early May 2022. Looking back at Electronic Arts’ historical stock price performance, the all-time high stands at $151.26, achieved in July 2018. In its latest quarterly earnings release, Electronic Arts total net revenue of about $1.9bn for the September 2022 quarter, up from about $1.83bn a year ago. Quarterly net income was close to flat over the past year at $299m. Investor focus was on earnings outlook. EA lowered its net bookings guidance – a key metric for near-term revenue – by $250m to a range of $7.65bn to $7.85bn for the full year ended 31 March 2023. The company cited a $200m foreign exchange-related impact as the main reason for the lower bookings guidance. As EA earns the majority of its revenue outside the US, the recent rise of the US dollar against other world currencies is expected to have an impact on revenue accounting. EA said on 1 November that, “as a rule of thumb”, if the US dollar strengthens 10% against the Euro and the British Pound, the company’s total net bookings will decrease by 2% with currency hedging. The cost of revenue and operating expenses will decrease by 2% in the same scenario, the company added. The company added that 2023 full-year net revenue is expected to be about $7.55bn to $7.75bn and diluted earnings per share is expected to be about $3.11 to $3.34. In other highlights for the quarter, EA said FIFA 23 became its most successful launch ever with over 10.3 million players joining the game within the first week. It also released the racing title Need for Speed Unbound during the September quarter. FIFA 23 is expected to be the last of EA’s popular FIFA franchise. From 2023 onwards, EA will release football games under a new EA SPORTS FC brand. While EA said that it retained licensing partnerships with more than 300 organisations, including the UEFA, Premier League, La Liga and Bundesliga, there is still uncertainty over how consumers will react to the end of EA’s 20-year licensing partnership with FIFA. Looking forward, gamers await the highly-anticipated Star Wars Jedi: Survivor slated to release on PlayStation5, Xbox Series and PC on 17 March 2023. With regard to M&A in the gaming sector, Piers Harding-Rolls, an analyst at Ampere Analysis, in an interview with CNBC following multi-billion acquisitions from Sony and Microsoft in recent months: “I think we’ve got a perfect storm. I’ve been covering this sector for 20 years and I’ve never seen anything like it.” Brian Murphy and Einav Mor-Samuels, of Appsflyer, the main drivers of the M&A boom in the gaming sector are “the pandemic-fuelled gaming landscape, a red-hot investment environment and mega studios striving to increase their UA [user acquisition] in a new privacy-centric reality”. However, the investment bank warned that the company has a relatively weaker track record of execution compared to its peers. According to research company Morningstar’s Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating Report, Electronic Arts is rated “low risk”. The report added: “The company is noted for showing particular strength in the quality and integrity of its board/management and its audit and financial performance systems.” However, Morningstar said EA is “exposed to cybersecurity risks including hackers gaining access to proprietary company information, such as source code for its games, and selling or leaking it on the web”. In its EA stock forecast, investment firm Jefferies rated Electronic Arts a ‘buy’ and set a price target of $165. “We believe EA has a strong medium- to long-term content pipeline, options on numerous fronts, and best-in-class ESG focus keep us bullish,” said Jefferies on 2 November. “Subscription looks like a 5-year growth engine and EA is well positioned against the cloud gaming opportunity,” added Jefferies. According to an Electronic Arts share price forecast compiled by , the consensus recommendation for EA stock, as of 30 December 2022, was ‘buy’ from 10 of 17 analysts. Seven analysts rated the stock ‘hold’. MarketBeat data showed the consensus Electronic Arts stock forecast for 2023 stood at about $148.10. Meanwhile, data firm said its global macro models projections and analyst-based Electronic Arts stock predictions saw the stock trading at $106.42 in one year’s time from 30 December 2022.

The company has struggled to secure sufficient funding to start production and reshuffled its management team. Faraday Future’s shareholders voted in November to approve a reverse , which would reduce the company’s share count and increase the price so that it remains compliant with the Nasdaq’s listing rule that a stock price should remain above $1 a share. The FFIE share price has been trading below $1 since September. What is the outlook for the company, and will the rebound or continue to shed value? We look at the company’s performance and analysts’ views on a . Founded in May 2014, Faraday Future is headquartered in California. It has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chengdu in China. The company is developing products and service offerings that integrate electric vehicles, AI, Internet and sharing models. Its flagship vehicle model is the FF 91, which is autonomous-ready and Internet connected. The first FF 91 pre-production model was manufactured in August 2018. Faraday Future plans to manufacture vehicles at its plant in California, and has a contract manufacturing partner in South Korea to meet its additional needs for future production capacity for its FF 81 model. The company has additional engineering, sales, and operational facilities in China, where it plans to develop manufacturing capability through a joint venture arrangement. The company was listed on the on 22 July 2021 via a merger with special purpose acquisition company ( ) Property Solutions Acquisition Corp. (PSAC). The listing raised $1bn, which was intended to finance the production of the FF 91 and FF 81 models. Faraday Future raised $7bn from seven funding rounds before going public. It has struggled to bring its EVs to mass production. The company’s co-founder, Jia Yueting, was removed from his role as chief executive officer in September 2019. He was replaced by former BMW ( ) executive Carsten Breitfeld. Jia filed for personal bankruptcy to settle $3.6bn in China and placed nearly all of his controlling stake in the company into a trust, reducing his control of the company. In April 2022, Faraday Future announced in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( ) that, on the recommendation of a special committee of independent directors following an “independent investigation into allegations of inaccurate Company disclosures”, the board had approved remedial actions, including removing Jia as an executive officer, although he would continue in his position as Chief Product & User Ecosystem Officer. The FFIE stock price closed its first day of trading at $13.98 a share, and has been in decline ever since. The share price ended 2021 at $5.32 and has fallen further in 2022. The stock jumped from $2.48 on 24 June to $7.52 on 15 July, as the FF 91 had been expected to enter production in July. The share price dropped back to $2.21 on 29 July after the company delayed production again. The share price moved up to $2.72 on 5 August, but fell again, even after the company announced on 15 August an additional $52m in committed funding with a framework facility for up to $600m. The investors received warrants with an exercise price of $5 a share. On 29 August, the company that it expected to receive equipment to complete its factory installation by the end of the year, and that “challenges with supply chain issues” had affected its FF 91 production timeline. The share price subsequently fell further, dropping below the $1 mark to $0.97 on 16 September. In late September, the firm an additional $100m in financing and stated that it was in “ongoing discussions with potential financing sources for additional capital required to fund operations through the end of 2022 and beyond. As part of ongoing efforts to conserve cash and reduce expenses, the Company recently implemented headcount reductions and other expense reduction and payment delay measures.” Faraday Future also resolved a governance dispute with FF Top, its largest shareholder, with two board members stepping down. In October, Faraday Future a management transition, including the replacement of its chief financial officer. On 14 November, the company it had received an equity line of credit for an initial commitment of $200m, which can be increased up to $350m. In late November the board Breitfeld as Global CEO and appointed former Ford and Jaguar Land Rover executive Chen Xuefeng, “following a comprehensive evaluation of the Company’s performance since it went public in July 2021.” The stock traded down to an all-time low of $0.24 on 7 December, spiked to $0.53 on 13 December before falling back to $0.32 on 27 December. The firm several management changes on 13 December, with executive and board member Matthias Aydt appointed Global Senior Vice President, Product Execution, replacing Bob Kruse who had recently left the company. Xiaoyang Ningtaking took on business development responsibilities previously held by Aydt, and Ma Xiao became acting head of Production Definition and Eco Mobile Systems. According to an on 15 December, Faraday Future has delayed the anticipated start of FF 91 production to the end of March 2023, with “deliveries to users anticipated to begin April 2023, subject to timely receipt of additional financing and stockholder approval.” The company is “engaged in discussions with both potential new investors and existing FF investors to provide the estimated $150-170M of additional capital needed to produce the FF 91.” The company has received a draft $30m binding letter of intent from a current investor, and it expects other investors to provide capital to support production. “No assurance can be provided that the Company’s ongoing financing discussions with existing and potential new FF investors will result in binding commitments in a timely manner or at all,” the company stated. “The Company’s plans with respect to additional funding assume stockholder approval of an authorised share increase by the end of January 2023.” In its third quarter results on 17 November, Faraday Future had said that it had just 369 preorders for the FF 91, down from 399 at the end of the second quarter, and an accumulated deficit of approximately $3.3bn as of 30 September. The company reported an operating loss of $81m for the quarter, down from $186m in the third quarter of 2021. Net loss was $103m, down from $304m a year earlier. Spending during the quarter was focused on completing the California manufacturing plant. The company stated: In an SEC filing alongside its quarterly report, the company stated that “there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year… The timing of first deliveries of FF 91 vehicles is uncertain and is not expected to occur in 2022 and remains subject to various conditions, many of which are outside of FF’s control, including the timing, size, and availability of additional financing as well as the implementation and effectiveness of FF’s headcount reductions and other expense reduction and payment delay measures.” The company added that it is also dependent on suppliers meeting their commitments on delivering parts. Faraday Future had just $31,766 of cash on hand as of 30 September. What do the latest Faraday Future stock predictions indicate about the outlook for the share price? According to data compiled by as of 28 December, few Wall Street analysts have issued a 12-month Faraday Future share price forecast. Analysts at Wedbush Securities downgraded the stock from buy to hold on 16 August, but without setting a price target. Algorithm-based forecasters were bearish on the outlook for the stock at the time of writing (28 December), with the Faraday Future stock forecast for 2023 from and the Faraday Future stock forecast from projecting that the share price could drop to zero in January. That would indicate a Faraday Future stock forecast for 2025 of zero, with the company possibly unable to operate as a going concern. The Faraday Future stock forecast from Stock Invest showed that the share price “lies in the middle of a very wide and falling trend in the short term and further fall within the trend is signalled. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to fall -43.20% during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between $0.0984 and $0.272 at the end of this 3-month period.” If you are looking for a FFIE stock forecast to decide whether to trade the stock, you should proceed with caution, given the concerns about the company’s operations.

Switzerland-based STMicro is to build an extension to its existing plant in France following revenue growth of 25% in the past year. Germany's Infineon also sets out plans for expansion after a record year of revenue growth. This comes a year after the proposal of the EU Chip act, which is designed to help promote Europe-based chip manufacturing. The current global market leader, Taiwan's TSMC ( ) has also decided to get a slice of the expected growth by making a number of deals with companies in the region. Much like the CHIPS act passed in the United states last year, the EU chips act, was proposed in the parliament in early 2022, and is designed to promote local production of semiconductors. Moreover, it is aimded at reducing dependency on outside manufacturing for a component which is becoming increasingly important in modern life. The act will set aside almost €45bn to inject the production of semiconductors. Europe has one of the largest appetites for semiconductors and yet has one of the lowest production rates, making the region highly dependent on imports. An article by points out the need to reduce this supply-demand mismatch. “It would be good if local production capacity of semiconductors matched the demand from European end-markets by the end of the decade. This way, the economy is less exposed to supply chain disruptions, but can also fully take part in future developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous, industrial systems, where leading-edge chip innovations will play a crucial role.” “Basically, every sector that will use AI systems needs advanced semiconductors. Europe, therefore, needs to be a part of these developments to remain relevant.” The report continues to state that “the EU Chips Act will promote economic growth in the coming decade”. The reports states the following reasons for the lack of production capacity so far : “Their chips are mainly made for the automotive and industrial sectors. Other chips for these industries may be designed by EU companies, but are made in foundries outside of Europe (in Asia). The absence of a large (consumer) electronics industry means there is no large-scale demand for advanced, leading-edge, logic chips, today. Hence the absence of production capacity.” The current market leader, TSMC ( ), currently owns more than 55% of global semiconductor foundries. This has placed an enormous dependency on the company which mainly operated out of Asia. This dependency was further highlighted during the supply chain disruptions in 2020. Regions outside of Asia have realised the importance of developing their own production. The proposed act does not discourage non-regional firms from establishing production in Europe, a loophole which TSMC may have already begun to exploit, as it reportedly starts new production partnerships in Europe. The CEO of Infineon Jochen Hanebeck said in an interview recently that the company is ready for expansion. He said the company is “on the lookout” for suitable acquisitors and is ready to spend “in the range of up to a few billion.” The German chip maker reported revenue growth of 30% for the year ending in September 2022. Some of the leading companies in Europe are Infineon ( ), NXP ( ) and STMicroelectronics ( ) all of which currently hold a consensus buy rating on Tiptanks.

This investing preference has grown as tech-savvy millennial investors entered financial markets to own a piece of their favourite tech brands, such as Apple ( ), Alphabet’s Google ( ) and Meta ( ). The market has paid back this good faith with hefty gains. The tech-exclusive Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector Index has outperformed the US benchmark S&P 500 Index ( ) over the last five years, as of 21 December, despite a fall in tech valuations in 2022. Are you looking for the best tech stocks to buy in 2023? In this article, you will learn about the latest technological trends and find a list of the top technology companies ranked by market performance over the past three years. Note that this article does not consitute financial or investment advice. Before you choose to trade or invest in any technology stock, always do your own research. Technological advancements seen across human history are sights to behold. From the creation of the wheel to the internet, innovation has helped humankind improve the quality of life by introducing life-enhancing goods and services. Individuals and companies have made a lot of money along the way by solving problems. Technology not only solved core needs like electricity and healthcare, but also brought new efficiencies, quality and conveniences that consumers spend on. Today, technology companies like smartphone maker Apple, software company Microsoft ( ) and Google-parent company Alphabet are among the top five companies that make the highest annual earnings in the world. Over the decades, these tech giants have returned bumper profits to investors. Take Apple, for example. An early Apple investor in 1982 would have seen their shares grow by 104,380% by December 2022. Investors are drawn to tech stocks by similar wealth-building stories resulting in promising tech firms reaching multi-billion dollar valuations even before returning a profit. Here we look at top technology trends identified, assessed and ranked by research firm McKinsey & Co based on five measures of activity – search engine queries, news publications, patents, research publications and investment. Investors will find these trends insightful when looking for best tech stocks to watch in 2023 and beyond. Applied artificial intelligence (AI) received the highest innovation score of all tech trends due to its large potential impact, according to the . The use of self-learning software for automation and problem-solving saw massive adoption of AI-based solutions across several industries. Applied AI included innovative technologies such as: Machine learning used for schedule optimisation and project management. Computer vision used for facial recognition and 3D model generation. Natural-language processing used for speech recognition in virtual voice assistants. Deep reinforcement learning used in robotic-arm motion in manufacturing and autonomous driving. Knowledge graphs used for social network analysis and marketing. Over 56% of 2021 survey respondents said their organisation were adopting AI, up from 50% recorded in 2020. While 67% of respondents reported revenue increases post-AI adoption. Advanced connectivity includes technologies, such as 5G/6G cellular networks, wireless low-power networks, low-Earth-orbit satellites and optical fibre. The McKinsey report said the adoption of these technologies will disrupt four major industries: automotive and assembly, healthcare, aerospace and defence, and retail. Notably, the combination of AI and advanced connectivity technologies is expected to be a major boon for patients with chronic illnesses, allowing them to be monitored at home using connected medical devices. The field of bioengineering was divided into four areas: Biomolecules that involved the study of genomics and intracellular engineering. Biosystems that studied complex biological organisations, processes and interactions. Biomachine interfaces that referred to innovation in connectivity between nervous systems of living organisms and machines. Biocomputing that studied cells for computing information. Some of the emerging benefits of bioengineering included the discovery of treatments for incurable diseases, laboratory cultivation of animal and plant-based meat, creation of sustainable biomaterial alternatives like vegan leather and invention of superior materials. According to the report, bioengineering tech is expected to have the highest impact on the healthcare sector followed by agriculture, chemicals and consumer packing industries. According to McKinsey, clean energy tech trends included energy solutions that aimed to achieve net-zero emissions across the energy value chain from power generation to production and distribution. Renewable energy, sustainable fuels, hydrogen-based fuels, long-duration energy storage solutions, intelligent power grid systems and electric vehicle charging infrastructure were notable clean energy trends. According to McKinsey, mobility is at a “second great inflection point” as the automobile and aerospace sectors shift towards autonomous, connected electric, and smart technologies. The report suggested disruption in passenger and goods transport systems due to innovations such as robot-taxis autonomous trucks, and last-mile delivery solutions such as sidewalk robots. McKinsey noted potential air mobility disruptions such as vertical takeoff and landing air taxis, hypersonic air travel, unmanned air freight vehicles and unmanned traffic management systems. Tech trends to watch in the mobility sector were autonomy, connected vehicles, electrification, smart mobility, advanced lightweight materials and value chain decarbonisation. Mckinsey noted nine other technology trends in its report: Cloud and edge computing Immersive-reality tech Industrialised machine learning Next generation software development Quantum technologies Trust architecture and digital identity Space technologies Sustainable consumption Please note that most technology stocks have suffered a slump in market valuations in 2022 following the start of a global monetary tightening cycle.

How disruptive tech works", "title_link": "https://capital.com/is-porsche-about-to-kill-off-tesla-how-disruptive-tech-works", "published_date": "10:49, 28 December 2022", "author": " Tim Worstall", "Description": "By At one level the idea that Porsche ( ) is about to kill off Tesla ( ) is ridiculous. No, the manufacturer of toys for middle-aged hairdressers is not going to ruin a mass market car manufacturer. It could be true if we considered the other Porsche ( ) as well – what used to be the parent of VW ( ). Combined, they might just be a danger as and when they roll out the EV versions of all of their vehicles. But even there, who do we think is going to buy a Skoda in preference to a Tesla? But in another sense, there’s a very good chance that Porsche really is going to shaft Tesla. This is not in terms of sales, or market competition for which brand of car we buy. Rather, there’s ‘something’ going on that is going to cause considerable rethink about whether we want to have an electric vehicle at all. And that is, obviously, a threat to the Tesla vision of the future. This is not, by the way, to issue some doom and gloom warning about TSLA. It is, rather, to point out a hugely important thing about investment decisions. Technological changes can seemingly come out of nowhere. Techs can blindside, markets to disrupt what otherwise would appear to be entirely sensible business plans. The particular ‘something’ I'm referring to here : A more important point about : While that’s before taxes, current European prices for petrol are about $2 a litre. And, at current energy prices, internal combustion engines are cheaper to run when you factor in electric cars are both more expensive to buy and also have much worse depreciation rates. The point here being not that EVs and petrol are now running head-to-head in costs. Rather, that we've now got at least the beginnings of an entirely rival technology to EVs, one that still meets climate targets. This has always been logically possible, if wind and/or solar gets cheap enough then it would be economically viable to use that to drive electrolysis plants which produce green hydrogen. Once we've got that then it's both cheap and well known how to make all the more complex hydrocarbons. We've known, as a civilisation, how to do this for a century at least. Now, my point is not, in fact, that this tech is about to sweep Tesla away. Quite apart from anything else I think that Tesla has – against all the odds – managed to get to the mass manufacturing stage where it’s going to be around for decades. OK, fine. But my point is still twofold for us as either investors or traders. We've, once again, a new tech here which is going to upset a lot of business plans. That new tech might not succeed and maybe it might do so. But we've got to think about it simply because, if it does, it shafts so may other business ideas out there. So, who might suffer if this wind power (or solar)-to-hydrogen-to-synthfuels works? Well, one idea is that the marginal EV producers aren’t going to gain a foothold. So, or might well find their plans don’t work out. Or, in fact, they get shafted. But that's not quite enough, we'd also like to think about who might benefit from this. Well, assume that aviation has to change to batteries (actually, a ludicrous idea for planes but still). Suddenly that century and more of jet engine experience inside is worthless. has some problems as plane design would have to be hugely different too. It’s not just that all that accumulated experience in those companies becomes less valuable. It’s also that the grand insights that make this new world of battery powered planes work might not be within either of those companies. In fact, we’d probably bet that it wouldn’t be. Now work this the other way around. We’ve got a way of making jet fuel that is carbon neutral. OK, it’s a bit more expensive than the current method but it is carbon neutral – so, therefore, it will be allowed to continue. So, who benefits from this new system of making jet fuel? It’s not necessarily the people who make the fuel. That’s likely to become a manufacturing process at normal manufacturing margins. But the people who own the secret sauce to make good use of jet fuel – airframe manufacturers, jet engine manufacturers – become very much more attractive investments. Or, as this realisation spreads through the markets, trades. Given the time of year this is when we’re all supposed to sit back and think a bit. So, here's that big though for the coming year – heck, decade. Technology does indeed change over time. So, we’ve got to think about which techs are likely to change, keep an eye out for which are, then think through who would benefit from their doing so. So, Porsche has just demoed a windmill to carbon neutral petrol station. OK, who gains from that? My answer would be Rolls Royce – those jet engines get to keep rolling. Now, I might be right or wrong about that but the logic stands. This also being one of the things that makes investing – trading – so interesting. It’s not just that the major beneficiary isn’t even involved in the tech change, they’re not even in the same industry. Isn’t that fun?

The Australia-listed company is focused on developing a lithium-boron project in Nevada in the US, to capitalise on the clean energy transition by supplying the electric vehicle (EV) battery industry. Is the fall in the INR stock price an opportunity to pick up shares at a discount to profit from long-term gains? In this article, we look at the key drivers for INR’S share price performance and some of the latest Ioneer stock predictions. Headquartered in Sydney, Australia, Ioneer was founded in 2001 as Global Geoscience. The company was listed on the ASX in 2007. The company its American Depositary Receipts ( ) on the in the US under the ticker symbol IONR on 30 June 2022. Global Geoscience acquired an option for the Rhyolite Ridge Lithium-Boron Project in June 2016 and acquired a 100% interest in the project in 2017. The company was renamed Ioneer in 2018, a combination of the words “ion” and “pioneer”, reflecting its focus on producing materials that are essential to a sustainable future, extracting them in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. The Rhyolite Ridge project is expected to be one of the lowest-cost lithium producers because of its boron content. It is estimated that the mine will produce around 20,600 tonnes of lithium per year. The mine is expected to start operations in 2025, producing enough lithium materials to supply approximately 400,000 EV batteries every year. The site is close to major lithium producer Albemarle’s Silver Peak lithium mine and 330km southeast of EV manufacturer Tesla’s Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada, which requires lithium to produce its battery cells. Precious metals producer Sibanye Stillwater became a 50% joint venture partner in the project in October 2021, investing $490m. The Rhyolite Ridge project is controversial, as there are concerns that It may damage a rare wildflower in the area, Tiehm's buckwheat, raising a debate as to whether the benefits of extracting lithium from the site outweigh the impact on the plant. The US Fish and Wildlife Service Tiehm’s buckwheat as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act on 14 December and designated 910 acres of critical habitat in the Rhyolite Ridge area. Ioneer’s share price has fallen by 54.8% since the start of 2022 to around A$0.38, although it has rebounded from a decline to A$0.08 in March 2020 at the start of Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns. In April 2020, Ioneer released the results of a Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) that validated the economics and viability of the Rhyolite Ridge project. The INR stock price climbed to an all-time high of A$0.84 on 14 January 2022. In February, South Korea’s EcoPro Innovation the volume of lithium it plans to offtake from the mine from 2,000 tonnes per year to 7,000 tonnes per year, the largest amount available under an agreement the two companies in June 2021. Ioneer has since signed other offtake agreements, including a five-year deal in July to supply 7,000 tonnes a year to Ford and a five-year to supply 4,000 tonnes annually to Prime Planet Energy & Solutions, which is a joint venture between Japanese automotive manufacturer Toyota and battery manufacturer Panasonic. On 8 December, Ioneer signed an agreement with Shell Canada Energy to buy 50,000 tonnes of sulphur annually for its ore processing. On 19 December, Ioneer announced that the project has advanced into the final stage of the federal permitting process, moving closer toward the completion of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process and approval of the project's Plan of Operations. Ioneer submitted its latest revised plan to the US Bureau of Land Management in July 2022, with no direct impact on the area’s populations of Tiehm's buckwheat. The Ioneer share price started 2022 at A$0.83 and dropped to A$0.46 in mid-March before rebounding to A$0.78 in early April. The stock dropped to its 52-week low of A$0.32 on 23 June. The share price moved up to A$0.73 in August and then traded between A$0.56 and A$0.68 until early December, when it fell from A$0.62 on 5 December to A$0.38 on 23 December. Ioneer’s latest quarterly cash flow for the three months to end of September, released on 24 October, showed that its net cash and cash equivalents fell from US$94.2m to $77m, equating to 5,2 months of financing for its activities. The company has applied for a loan from the US Department of Energy, as political support for developing a domestic US supply chain for battery materials has grown. According to Ioneer’s annual general meeting in November, it expects to produce annual revenue of $422m and $288m annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ( ) from the mine. What is the long-term Ioneer stock forecast? At the time of writing, stock data provider had tracked only one Wall Street analyst offering a 12-month Ioneer share price forecast in the last three months, with a price target of A$0.70 and a buy recommendation. That represented an 84.71% increase from the closing price of A$0.38 on 23 December. According to ASX data provider , the consensus from brokers that have issued an Ioneer stock forecast was a strong buy, with six analysts issuing buy recommendations, two rating the stock a hold, and no sell ratings. The Ioneer stock forecast for 2023 from data provider was bearish at the time of writing, predicting the share price could edge down to A$0.34 in one year from A$0.36 at the end of this quarter, based on its global macro model projections and analysts’ expectations. The Ioneer stock forecast for 2025 from algorithm-based forecaster showed the share price could take time to return to its previous highs, reaching A$0.869 by the end of the year, from A$0.554 at the end of 2023 and A$0.717 at the end of 2024. The stock could reach new highs in 2027, trading at A$1.15 by the end of the year. Back in April, Henry Fung, co-founder of MF & Co. Asset Management, wrote in an Ioneer stock forecast that by the time the company starts production, “it will likely have buyers lining up for its lithium, and profitability would be a given”. Are you looking for a Ioneer stock forecast to decide whether to buy the company’s shares? Keep in mind that market volatility can make it difficult for analysts and algorithm-based forecasters to come up with accurate long-term targets. As such, they can and do get their prediction wrong. We recommend that you always do your own research. Look at the latest market trends, news, technical and fundamental analysis, and expert opinion before making any investment decision. Keep in mind that past performance is no guarantee of future returns. And never invest money you cannot afford to lose. Whether INR is a good stock to add to your portfolio depends on your risk tolerance and how much you intend to invest. You should do your own research to take an informed view of the stock. Keep in mind that past performance is no guarantee of future returns. And never invest money you cannot afford to lose. The direction of the INR share price will likely depend on the company receiving the necessary permits to start its mining operations, and demand for its lithium once it starts production, among other factors. Whether you should invest in INR stock is a decision only you can make based on your personal circumstances. You should do your own research to take an informed view of the stock. Keep in mind that past performance is no guarantee of future returns. And never trade money that you cannot afford to lose.

The Shenzhen-based company’s stock price has tumbled from HK301.20 in late June this year to HK201.60 as the market closed on 19 December 2022. Analysts have flagged up the issue of intensifying competition in what is already a fiercely saturated marketplace for new electric vehicles (EV). However, there are hopes BYD can recover lost ground over the coming year with the global expansion of its business and the launch of new passenger brands. In our we look at the performance of the stock price this year, analyse the company’s recent news and ask analysts for their BYD stock predictions. can be traced back to 1995 when it began developing rechargeable batteries. Its growth has been rapid. Over the past 27 years, it’s transformed from a relatively small start-up with 20 employees to a global giant employing more than 230,000 people. Overall, the company now has more than across six continents. It’s involved in electronics, automobiles, new energy and rail transit. BYD has been involved in EVs since 2003. The company has focused attention on research and development, with chief designer Wolfgang Egger leading an international team. According to , the automobile segment contributes about half of company revenue. This includes manufacturing and selling electric and internal combustion vehicles, primarily passenger vehicles and buses, as well as low-carbon urban rail transportation products. BYD stock started trading on on 31 July 2002 at RMB 1.00 a share. Its stock code is 01211. In 2011, the company also listed on at CNY 18. It’s stock code is 002594. BYD stock has been hit by investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway ( ) continuing to unwind its position in the company that it’s held since 2008. It has sold around 16 million H shares in the business across six separate transactions since 24 August 2022, according to . The total generated by the sales is around HK3.4bn. Our BYD share price forecast has to consider the recent price movements of the company’s quoted stock, which doesn’t make for great reading. , the has fallen 24%, down from HK265 at the start of January 2022 to HK201.60 as the market closed on 20 December 2022. There have been highs and lows along the way. The BYD stock price was trading at HK166.9 in March 2022, reaching highs of HK331.40 in late June. As far as a longer term BYD stock forecast is concerned, the company’s performance is more impressive. In fact, the price has risen 196% from HK68 to $201.60 over the last five years. According to data, the stock has also achieved trailing returns of 25.69% over the period, according to data to 20 December, 2022. The company that profit had risen 206.35% to RMB3.6bn ($520m) for the six months to the end of June 2022. In a statement, it said delivery units of the company’s new energy vehicles “achieved non-stop new highs”, with market share increasing significantly. “The rapid growth in sales volume has helped the company to scale up and improve its profitability, which partially offset the pressure brought by the inflation of the raw materials,” it stated. BYD pointed out that the combination of Covid-19 and the Russia-Ukraine conflict “formed an intertwined effect” that led to a “complicated and severe” international situation. “As a result, the commodity [sic] prices soared, global inflation exceeded consensus expectations, and the world economic growth had a notable slowdown,” it added. In late November 2022, BYD that its three millionth new energy vehicle had rolled off the production lines and unveiled a new passenger car brand. Wang Chuanfu, BYD’s chairman and president, pledged to continue focusing on “scientific and technological innovation” in the face of ever-changing consumption trends. “In addition to that, BYD will keep on fulfilling people's pursuit for a better life with leading technologies and diversified products,” he said. He also announced BYD would build Yangwang, a high-end brand targeting the luxury market that would offer disruptive technologies. The model launch for this brand is expected during the first quarter of 2023. In addition, BYD will release another new brand next year “to meet the diversified demand” of consumers. Sales of electric cars doubled in 2021, according to the global electric vehicle outlook 2022. It pointed out that nearly 10% of global car sales were electric in 2021, four times the market share in 2019. “This brought the total number of electric cars on the world’s roads to about 16.5 million, triple the amount in 2018,” it stated. The success of EVs was attributed to a range of factors, such as public spending on subsidies and incentives for EVs nearly doubling in 2021 to USD $30bn. The good news for companies such as BYD is the increase in EV sales during 2021 was primarily led by China. In fact, it accounted for half of the growth, according to the IEA’s report. It said: The study also noted that electric cars in China are typically smaller than in other markets. “This, alongside lower development and manufacturing costs, has contributed to decreasing the price gap with conventional cars,” it added. So, what are the BYD stock predictions of analysts? Vincent Sun, an equity analyst at , raised some concerns, although he still liked BYD’s offering in the plug-in hybrid arena. “We see intensifying price pressure in China's new energy vehicle, or NEV, market, especially in the mass-market and entry-level premium segments,” he said in a BYD stock forecast for 2022. Much of this is to do with the wider market. “After Tesla’s late October China price cuts, several automakers followed suit, offering direct discounts, insurance rebates, and other incentives,” he explained. According to the algorithmic forecasts of as of 21 December, BYD stock was a “very good long-term investment” that could rise 38% over the coming year to HK278.9. The site’s BYD stock forecast for 2025, meanwhile, had the price shooting up to HK432.88 by December 2025. This would represent a 115% premium over the HK201.60 closing price on 20 December, 2022. Note that analysts’ predictions can be wrong and should not be used as a substitute for your own research. Always conduct your own due diligence before trading, looking at the latest news, and , and a wide range of commentary. Remember, past performance does not guarantee future returns. And never trade more money than you can afford to lose.

Musk confirmed the news himself as he tweeted “the bird is freed” on his personal Twitter account, referencing the social media site’s bird logo. Shortly after taking control of the company, Musk reportedly fired several top executives, including head of legal policy, trust and safety Vijaya Gadde, chief financial officer Ned Segal and CEO Parag Agrawal. Musk is the second most popular user on Twitter – behind former US President Barack Obama – with 110 million followers on the social media platform. He initially became the company’s largest shareholder on 4 April, investing $2.89bn to take a 9.2% stake. His purchase of 73.5 million shares at the last closing stock price of $53.70 a share on 27 October gave the stake a book value of $3.94bn. Musk originally offered $54.20 a share for the social media network on 13 April, using a combination of debt and equity, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( ). On 31 March, a filing with the SEC by fund management giant Vanguard showed it was the company’s largest shareholder, with a 10.29% stake in Twitter. The company’s board of directors responded on 15 April with a ‘poison pill’, a defensive strategy to make a company less attractive to a hostile takeover bid. A poison pill is a shareholder rights plan that gives a company’s existing shareholders the right to buy new shares at a discounted price, which serves to dilute the ownership interest of the hostile party and possibly thwart their takeover. Twitter would have allowed shareholders to buy shares if Musk acquired a 15% stake, as more than 15% would give him control of the company. Musk countered the poison pill provision by making an offer to shareholders directly for them to tender their shares, despite opposition from the board. Twitter’s board of directors announced on 25 April that they had approved the deal, as it would “deliver a substantial cash premium” to shareholders – Musk’s offer represented a 38% premium to the closing price on 1 April 2022, before the Tesla CEO initially acquired a stake in the company. On the day of that announcement, TWTR stock closed the trading day at $51.70. Musk then changed his mind about the deal, accusing the company of misleading the public about the number of automated accounts – known as ‘spam bots’ – active on its platform. The spam bot issue culminated in a termination letter sent by Musk’s representatives to the company on 8 July and disclosed in an SEC filing. Skadden attorney Mike Ringler claimed that “Twitter has not complied with its contractual obligations”. Ringler also claimed that Twitter repeatedly failed to provide Musk with the information he had requested. Musk had previously said that he wanted to evaluate claims that about 5% of the platform’s monetisable daily active users (mDAUs) were spam accounts. “Twitter has failed or refused to provide this information,” Ringler claimed. Minutes after the letter became public, Twitter vowed to fight in court, with board chair Bret Taylor commenting on the matter in a tweet. The Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement. We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Musk’s takeover plan had included a provision that if the deal fell apart, the party breaking the agreement would pay a termination fee of $1bn, given certain circumstances. Whether the conflict over spam bots would be enough to allow Musk to walk away from the deal has been a matter of legal debate. On 12 July, Twitter filed a lawsuit against Musk in an attempt to force him to complete the acquisition. Musk responded with that were made public on 4 August, arguing that he agreed to acquire the company based on Twitter’s SEC filings, which “contain numerous, material misrepresentations or omissions that distort Twitter’s value and caused the Musk parties to agree to acquire the company at an inflated price… that has been Twitter’s strategy all along: to distract from and obfuscate the truth about its disclosures – first from its investors and then from the Musk parties when they began to discern the truth.” Twitter responded to the counterclaims in a filing with the court on 4 August: The company argued that Musk was attempting to “escape a merger agreement that Musk no longer found attractive once the stock market – and along with it, his massive personal wealth – declined in value”. The company added that “after spending months looking for an excuse to get out of the contract, Musk claimed to terminate it”, explaining his supposed reasons in a letter to Twitter on 8 July. It went on: “When Twitter sued to enforce its rights and exposed the weakness of those reasons, Musk spent weeks coming up with more supposed reasons – the counterclaims – which offer up an entirely new set of excuses for his breach.” Twitter added that when he made the acquisition offer, Musk did not ask for any information on spam accounts and no references to false accounts were made in the merger agreement, noting: “To the contrary, Musk forwent all due diligence – giving Twitter 24 hours to accept his take-it-or-leave-it offer before he would present it directly to Twitter’s stockholders.” On 29 August, Ringler issued a new termination notice to Twitter’s former legal chief Vijaya Gadde via an , after Musk moved to subpoena Twitter’s former security chief Peiter Zatko, following news of a whistleblower report he filed in July. “We write on behalf of X Holdings I, Inc. and X Holdings II, Inc. (the “Musk parties”) to provide an additional notice of termination of the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among the Musk parties and Twitter, Inc. (“Twitter”) dated as of 25 April 2022,” the letter said. On 30 August, Twitter responded again, rejecting Musk’s termination claim. “As was the case with your 8 July 2022 purported notice of termination, the purported termination set forth in your August 29, 2022 letter is invalid and wrongful under the agreement,” the company wrote in a letter with the SEC. On 19 July, Twitter secured an expedited trial date scheduled for 17 October, which should have resulted in a ruling on whether or not Musk would be required by the courts to go ahead with the acquisition. In a letter sent to Twitter on 3 October, it was stated Musk would proceed with the deal agreed upon in April, “provided that the Delaware Chancery Court enter an immediate stay of the action” in the court case between the Tesla CEO and Twitter. On 5 October, less than two weeks before Musk and Twitter were scheduled to go to trial, Musk to Twitter asking to revive his offer to purchase the social media giant for the original price of $54.20 a share. In response to the letter, Twitter reported that they intended to to close the transaction. However, they did not expressly state whether they would be dropping the lawsuit against Elon Musk. Twitter issued this statement about today's news: We received the letter from the Musk parties which they have filed with the SEC. The intention of the Company is to close the transaction at $54.20 per share. Twitter’s historical stock price was in an upward trend from 2017 until it peaked at its all-time high of $77.63 a share on 1 March 2021. However, the share price declined in 2022, falling to $31.30 in February – its lowest level since July 2020. The price trend came under pressure as investors questioned how the company could increase revenue from its millions of users, with further bearish sentiment coming from the broader sell-off in technology stocks so far in 2022. TWTR stock price spiked from $38.69 a share at the end of March to $50.98 on 5 April after Musk bought his stake in the company. It dropped to $44.48 on 12 April but rallied again and reached $51.70 on 25 April, when Musk made his acquisition offer. TWTR dropped again, from $49.02 at the end of April to $35.76 on 24 May as Musk began to make comments that he would not move forward with the deal unless Twitter provided data proving that spam accounts make up less than 5% of its users. Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users The share price ticked back above $40 at the end of May, but doubts about the deal continued. The stock dropped by more than 5% to close at $36.81 on 8 July, a response linked to news that Musk had officially terminated his plans to acquire the company. The share price rebounded to $44.43 on 10 August, but dropped to $39.30 on 30 August in response to Musk’s second termination agreement. On 4 October, following reports of Musk’s agreement to go through with the deal, TWTR stock rebounded 22% to $52. Following the completion of Musk’s acquisition, TWTR was from the New York Stock Exchange ( ) as the company went private. The stock’s final closing price was $53.70 on 27 October. This was a rise of of 23% year-to-date ( ) but a fall of 30% from its 2021 all-time high. Some analysts had speculated that Musk was looking to renegotiate the deal at a lower price after the fall in the value of technology stocks this year. US investment bank Truist Securities had noted in a Twitter stock analysis on 4 April: The analysts pointed out that Musk bought into the company at a time when its stock was traded down by around 40% from the trailing 12-month period, at around five times its revenue estimate. At the time Truist had a Twitter stock price target of $50 a share. What does Musk’s acquisition mean for the Twitter share price forecast? In its announcement on 25 April, the company said that when the transaction was to be completed later this year, Twitter would become “a privately held company”, with its shares no longer publicly traded. Paperwork with the SEC on 28 October confirmed that the social media giant’s delisting would take place on 8 November. Musk was expected to make changes to the platform that would no longer require shareholder approval or be subject to concerns about the impact on the share price. On 27 October, following the finalisation of the aqcuitision, the Tesla CEO tweeted an open letter to Twitter advertisers outlining the direction he wanted the social media site to go in, though he didn’t detail any concrete plans for the future. On 8 November, Musk unveiled ‘Twitter Blue’ a paid verification system under which, for $8 a month, any user on Twitter could purchase a blue check mark, usually reserved for the accounts of high profile individuals or groups. The plan later had to be revised to address users taking advantage of the check mark to impersonate high profile accounts. Later that month, Twitter reinstated all formerly banned accounts, including that of former US President Donald Trump. More recently, the company banned links to a number of competing social media sites on its platform. The decision, like many made following the acquisition, was met with controversy and the decision was overturned soon after. On 8 December, Musk put up a poll on his Twitter account asking his followers if they believed he should step down as the head of the social media company. Though the numbers were close, the poll closed with 57.5% of the votes being for ‘yes’. Musk has that he would abide by the poll’s results and “resign as CEO as soon as [he finds] someone foolish enough to take the job”. The CEO added that he intended to keep running the software and servers teams. In an , technology editor Zoe Kleinman said of the situation: Following the Twitter’s acquisition in October, its stock has been delisted from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and can no longer be purchased. As a general rule however, whether any stock is an appropriate short-term trade for your portfolio will depend on your personal investing strategy and portfolio goals. It’s important that you do your own research on the latest developments to decide how to trade the stock. And never invest money that you cannot afford to lose. Following the completion of his acquisition on 27 October, Elon Musk is the owner of Twitter.

A key risk monitored was Marathon Digital’s bitcoin-backed debt and the possibility of in the event of further drops in bitcoin prices. Will continue to rise? Let’a take a look at the and what’s driving it. Marathon Digital Holdings is a bitcoin mining and bitcoin holding company. It is listed on the under the ticker MARA. The company was incorporated as Verve Venture in 2010. It renamed itself as American Strategic Minerals Corporation in 2011, and was engaged in the exploration of uranium and vanadium minerals. Less than a year later, the company discontinued its minerals business to invest in real estate properties in California, US. In November 2017, the company, then known as Marathon Patent Group, merged with firm Global Bit Ventures, following which the company purchased cryptocurrency mining machines and established a data centre in Canada to mine cryptocurrencies. However, the merger fell through in June 2018. The company continued its crypto mining operations and renamed itself as Marathon Digital Holdings in March 2021. Marathon Digital said in an that the company’s strategy was to hold bitcoin as a long-term investment. The firm also added that it will buy bitcoin from the open market with excess cash and may issue debt or to raise capital to purchase bitcoin. As of 30 November 2022, Marathon Digital held 11,757 bitcoins. The total holding value stood at over $198.7m based on bitcoin’s price of about $16,900 on 20 December 2022. Unrestricted bitcoin holdings stood at about 4,200 BTC. According to , at the time of writing (20 December) Marathon Digital was the second biggest publicly-listed bitcoin holding company after US-based software firm MicroStrategy. Marathon Digital endured a tough time in 2022 as its stock crashed over 87% by mid-December.There were several factors at play that led to an extremely for the stock. Rising were the predominant force that pushed stock market valuations to multi-year lows in 2022. The tightened conditions also caused capital outflows from the cryptocurrency markets. Adding to that were several bankruptcies and crypto implosions within the sector that exacerbated the situation and hindered recovery in bitcoin and prices. With Marathon solely earning its revenue in bitcoin via block rewards and transaction fees, its total revenue for the third quarter of 2022 slumped 75% year-on-year as bitcoin prices fell over 60% in 2022. The company’s expenses surged as crude oil and natural gas prices rose to multi-decade highs following supply constraints amid Covid restrictions and the Russia-Ukraine war. Marathon’s bitcoin mining energy and hosting expenses rose 270% year-on-year to about $43m in the first nine months of 2022. Furthermore, bitcoin mining difficulty scaled to record levels in 2022. In its third quarter result, Marathon reported bitcoin production of 616 coins, compared to 1,253 coins a year ago. Although the bitcoin network was designed to make mining more difficult with time and competition, sustained high mining difficulty has hurt the bitcoin mining industry. On 19 December, MARA stock fell to an over two-year low of $3.69. The difficult business conditions marked by rising interest rates, falling cryptocurrency prices, record bitcoin mining difficulty and elevated energy prices resulted in a rise in MARA short interest in 2022. Data compiled by showed MARA stock short interest – based on the total number of shares shorted – surged from 19.95 million shares at the end of 2021 to 42.31 million shares by end-November 2022. MARA short interest data showed the percentage of shares shorted to public float at 36.2% by the end of November 2022, up from about 21% at the start of the year. Short sellers were circling Marathon Digital after witnessing several bitcoin miners announce bankruptcies and liquidity warnings. Among the fallen was Compute North, one of the biggest bitcoin miners in the US, which filed for bankruptcy in September 2022. Marathon Digital shared a close relationship with Compute North as the former provided bitcoin miners to the latter to maintain and operate. Earlier in 2022, Marathon Digital $10m in convertible preferred stock of Compute Nortt. It also lent $30m and made $50m operating deposits to Compute North. Marathon Digital an impairment charge of $39m in its third quarter result and wrote off $8m of the deposit later in a . A key risk driving Marathon Digital short interest was a bitcoin-collateralised loan agreement with Silvergate Bank in which the company borrowed an initial $100m in July 2022. In October 2022, the company borrowed an additional $50m from the facility and provided an extra 3,993 bitcoins as collateral. At the time, the total collateral amounted to 7,821 bitcoins. However, as bitcoin prices slumped in November 2022 following the , Marathon Digital was required to provide an additional 1,669 bitcoins as collateral to maintain its margin. This took Marathon’s total collateral to 9,490 bitcoins and left the company with only 1,950 unrestricted bitcoins, as of 9 November 2022. The miner became fearful of a further drop in bitcoin prices that could require it to meet margin calls or have its loans liquidated. The firm commented: Despite the heightened pessimism over Marathon Digital, a can not be ruled out. An overcrowded short market can be vulnerable to short squeeze in the event of favourable market news, increased long investor interest and WallStreetBets-style orchestrated market moves. For now, cryptocurrency prices remain the key driver for the MARA stock price. Investors should watch for bankruptcies among crypto firms, which could drag bitcoin prices lower. Other key areas to monitor are crypto regulatory developments and US Federal Reserve ( ) interest rate hike policy. Note that while increased or subdued short interest in a stock may provide a potential insight into a company’s performance, it shouldn’t be used as a substitute for your own research. Investors and traders are encouraged to perform adequate due diligence on any security they wish to trade in, looking at the latest news, and and a wide range of commentary. Remember, past performance does not guarantee future returns. And never trade money you cannot afford to lose.

The two companies have since July 2022 to help power Netflix’s new ad-supported subscription offering. Microsoft’s take-over of Activision Blizzard (ATVI), which would be the most expensive takeover in gaming history, costing $69bn, has been facing regulatory obstacles. Thus, it may have these funds to spend elsewhere in 2023. Netflix’s shares are trading at half the price they were a year ago, so a decent offer may be hard to pass up. However, some may argue that in an ever crowded streaming industry, the shares are not undervalued. At $298, the shares are now trading back at pre-pandemic levels: before they got the stay-at-home boost provided by global Covid lockdowns. Since his appointment in 2014, Nadella has been clear in his mission to expand Microsoft’s presence in different parts of the tech industry. Under his tenure, Microsoft has acquired Mojang, the Swedish gaming company responsible for Minecraft. It then purchased Xamarin, LinkedIn and GitHub. Most recently Microsoft has its eye on Activision Blizzard (ATVI), a gaming company most famous for Call of Duty and Candy Crush. The tech giant has offered $69bn for the takeover, but it has regulatory push back due to licencing issues with competitor Sony ( ). If the deal does not go through, the extra cash might be directed elsewhere, and Netflix appears to be a good choice for the tech giant. The pioneer of the streaming services has found it hard to sustain profit growth in recent months. After a historical performance in 2020, Netflix’s fall from grace has been hard and fast. While 2020 gave a boost to all streaming platforms, rivals such as Disney ( ) continued to grow while Netflix did not. It lost subscribers and reported a decline in revenue for the first time ever in 2022. One of Netflix’s growth bets was its expansion in Asia, which appears not to have earned the company as much revenue as it may have hoped. It reported a revenue growth of 18% this year. In an effort to maintain revenue, the Netflix platform has plans to introduce a paid subscription tier, which may just have a negative effect on audience numbers or could just be the key to get back to the 20% -35% growth rates the company was able to achieve in its early days. Netflix’s other plan is to expand its gaming services, which it has already rolled out on a small scale for its mobile app users. Its aim is to use gaming to increase screen time on Netflix. Teaming up with Microsoft could help accelerate this gaming ambition. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould comments “The chatter about a tie-up looks more like fantasy M&A rather than a credible story and one can imagine that it would be a tough sell to convince many Microsoft shareholders that they should own a content platform that by its own admission is finding it harder to sustain previously strong growth levels.” However Mould admits if shareholders come on board, the deal might turn out to be a good one. “Netflix wants to offer a comprehensive streaming service for games while Microsoft has the content and wants to reach a bigger audience. Strategically the two companies could be a good fit” However, Microsoft would need to dig deep. At its current share price, the market capitalisation of Netflix is around $133bn - almost double what it has offered for Activision Blizzard.

Tesla’s shares peaked in November 2021 after growing almost 200% in value since 2019. It has been on a decline since, losing more than two thirds of that gain. One of the major reasons for this downward push is likely coming from the erratic behaviour of the EV maker’s CEO Elon Musk. A bigger trend of sector rotation is also at play, with investors moving away from growth stocks such as Tesla and moving towards value stocks such as Exxon Mobil ( ) as recession fears deepen. Analysts say this could be a major theme of 2023. One of the biggest setbacks for Tesla share price has been its own CEO and his capricious behaviour. Elon Musk has partly funded his $44bn buy out of Twitter with his private money. He has sold $22bn worth of TSLA stock since he made his offer for Twitter. However, it’s the very same maverick nature of Musk which may be the reason behind why Tesla is trading at a premium compared to its peers. Tesla’s P/E sits at around 38, even reaching a peak of 60 in 2022. While competing EV makers such as Rivian ( ) and Lucid ( ) have a p/e of less than 3. Even other car makers such as Ford ( ) and Volkswagen ( ) maintain a p/e of around 3 to 6. Markets may be realising this overvaluation as Musk’s behaviour begins to sit uncomfortably. His stepping down from Twitter may now be a saving grace for Tesla shareholders. Danni Hewson, AJ Bell Financial Analyst says: “Mr Musk’s split focus is troubling, especially at a time when expectations are that Tesla’s next set of financial results won’t look too pretty.” Beyond the stock specific reasons for Tesla price falling, the trends in the broader market suggest the downward push is coming from investors moving away from growth stocks such as Tesla, and moving towards value stocks such as Exxon and other commodity companies. A number of growth stocks gained tremendous momentum at the start of the year just as commodity stocks came down from a historic high. In 2020, commodity companies, particularly oil majors such as Exxon Mobil ( ), BP ( ), Shell ( ), saw a historically high income. While growth companies struggled. However it would only be less than two years before growth companies would rebound. During the beginning of 2022, stocks of Alphabet ( ), Microsoft ( ), Tesla ( ) soared. Apple ( ) even briefly crossed a historic $1trn valuation. This was an indication that the market had relaxed out of recessionary fears. Now the market appears to be in fear again and returning to the trends of 2020, and analysts believe this is likely to carry on into 2023 Daniel Grosvenor, director of global equity strategy at Oxford Economics comments: “We believe growth stocks will continue to underperform against this macro backdrop. Growth valuations remain elevated versus historic norms, and we believe that the growth universe is relatively vulnerable to the coming downturn due to its sector tilts.” As Musk said in a tweet: “Tesla will be great long-term, but doesn’t control macroeconomic tides.” Markets in this article Rate this article Rate this article: Most traded Join the 610,000+ traders worldwide that chose to trade with Capital.com Contact us: CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs.

The China-based business saw its stock price more than double within hours from $10.20 to $22.81, ending its first day of trading - 15 December - down at $7.63. Meanwhile, Lanvin's parent company Fosun International ( ) saw its shares fall slightly on the day of Lanvin's floatation, yet rising over 4% a day later. What's next for Lanvin, which manages an impressive line-up of popular brands, including Lanvin and Italian shoemaker Sergio Rossi? Will LANV stock end the 2022 on a high or will broader economic concerns act as a dampener on performance as we approach the new year? In this , we take a look at the business, assess its prospects, and outline the views of analysts. Lanvin group was founded in 2017 by Fosun International Limited to capitalise on the growing global demand for luxury fashion. Fosun is a consumer group co-founded by Chinese businessman and investor Guo Guangchang. It listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange ( ) in 2007 and trades under the ticker 00656.HK. The Lanvin Group from Fosun Fashion Group in October 2021 to align it more with Lanvin’s entrepreneurial creator, Jeanne Lanvin. Its portfolio of brands include the flagship Lanvin, which was originally founded in Paris by Jeanne Lanvin in the late 1800s. There’s also Italian shoemaker Sergio Rossi, Austrian skinwear specialist Wolford, US womenswear brand St. John and Caruso, which specialises in high-end menswear. A key point in our Lanvin Group stock forecast was the business beginning to trade on the NYSE on 15 December 2022 under the ticker LANV. It was made possible by the merger of Lanvin with Primavera Capital Acquisition Corporation, a special purpose acquisition company ( ). According to Ms. Joann Cheng, Lanvin’s chairman and chief executive, going public was “a natural step” for the group. “We have built an iconic portfolio of heritage brands and recorded strong growth over recent years,” she said. The company’s strategy is to drive “continuous organic growth” through geographic, channel and product expansion for its brands, combined with “disciplined investment” in the luxury fashion sector. “Against a background of proven resilience in the luxury market, we are confident that this strategy will enable us to deliver sustained long-term growth and value for our shareholders,” she added. Any LANV stock forecast must consider that it’s very early days. The LANV stock price initially enjoyed a spectacular debut on the NYSE on 15 December 2022. Within hours it had more than doubled from $10.20 to $22.81 after the high profile listing caught the imagination of investors. The LANV stock price then gradually slipped during the course of its first day of trading and ended up closing down at $7.63. The following day, however, was better. The stock opened at $9.74 and ended its second day as a quoted business at $10. This represented a 31% increase over the previous day’s close. The Lanvin flotation has been positive for Fosun stock, which had risen 10.7% to HK$6.2 over the past month to market close on 16 December 2022. The company’s most recently published results for the six months to the end of June 2022 showed a 73% year-on-year revenue increase of €202m ($214m). In a statement, Ms. Joann Cheng, Lanvin’s chairman and chief executive, said the group “continues to deliver on its strategy”, with record first half results and momentum continuing to build. The company said its performance in the first half of 2022 was marked by an “exceptional phase of growth”, building on the strong momentum achieved in 2021. Lanvin’s revenue was fuelled by “outstanding growth in Europe and North America”, where revenue grew 91% and 58% year-over-year respectively. It declared this to be a testament to the group’s solid foundation in its five brands’ home turf and the success of its global growth strategies. It added: It’s also worth bearing in mind the current outlook when considering the Lanvin Group stock forecast for 2023. As far as the LANV stock forecast for the next 12 months is concerned, the company’s management believes consumer appetite for premium quality goods remains strong and resilient. “The group will continue to execute its proven strategies to deliver sustained growth and create long-term value for shareholders against ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties,” it stated. Our Lanvin Group share price forecast needs to bear in mind wider . On this point there appears to be some optimistic news. The global luxury market was projected to grow by 21% this year, reaching a market value of €1.4trn, according to the . The report predicted further expansion in sales and market value for such goods over the coming year and decade – despite the expected recessionary conditions. Claudia D’Arpizio, lead author of the study, said: What are analysts’ Lanvin Group stock predictions? Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell, told Capital.com that people remained concerned about the wider economic environment “Lanvin’s bosses are hoping to take advantage of a resilient high end consumer but despite initial excitement at the stocks New York debut investors are still running scared of retail,” she said. Hewson pointed out that the sector had been “battered by a scorching hot inflationary environment” and a landscape that is still shifting post-Covid, adding: However, she also acknowledged that there were positives: Elsewhere, Jay R Ritter, eminent scholar at the Warrington College of Business at the University of Florida, raised concerns. In a , he warned that swings in supply and demand could “push the price around”, as there were so few shares of the company available for public trading. He added: This makes it difficult to accurately predict a Lanvin Group stock forecast for 2025. The company’s prospects could depend on its own performance and the wider economic backdrop. Note that analysts’ Lanvin Group stock predictions may be wrong and shouldn’t be used as substitutes for your own research. Always conduct your own due diligence before trading, looking at the latest news, and , and a wide range of analyst commentary. Remember, past performance does not guarantee future returns. And never trade more money than you can afford to lose. Whether Lanvin Group is a good stock for you to buy should depend on your opinion of the company and your own investment objectives. Remember, it’s very important to reach your own conclusion of the company’s prospects and likelihood of achieving analysts’ targets. Past performance does not guarantee future returns. And never trade more money than you can afford to lose. No-one knows for sure and it’s also very early days for LANV stock. On its first day of trading – 15 December, 2022 – it initially doubled in value before closing down below its opening price. That is down to your view of the company and its future prospects. You will need to draw your own conclusions and not rely solely on the views of analysts. Your long-term investment goals and attitude to risk must play a part in your decision.

The troubled cryptocurrency miner suffered a spike in short interest in November as its stock value plummeted to two-year lows. What’s the latest on the stock value and could there be a if the market rebounds? Here we take a look at the Riot Blockchain is a company, which operated nearly 31,000 rigs, as of late 2021. The company’s main farm Whinstone Facility is located in Rockdale, Texas, US. Riot generates revenue from three business segments: Once known as Bioptix, the company renamed to Riot Blockchain in October 2017. Bioptix was a publicly-traded company since 2003. The stock is listed on the under the ticker symbol ‘RIOT’. has fallen 83% in 2022 (as of 19 December). Cryptocurrency markets have been shaken by a shift in the macroeconomic backdrop prompted by increases in the benchmark of major . In addition, top projects and firms within this space – such as the Terra ecosystem, the Celsius network, and more recently, the - have suffered a collapse, which rippled through the markets. This resulted in sharp declines in digital assets across the board. Bitcoin (BTC) fell 65% in 2022, as of 19 December, while such as cardano ( ) and solana ( ) suffered drops of 80% and higher. The fall of cryptocurrency prices has a direct impact on the financial performance of Riot Blockchain as its mining operations generate less revenues. Hence, the stock has become a target of short-sellers, who are increasing their bets against RIOT since late August, as indicated by the RIOT short interest. Short sellers borrow the shares of a company with the expectation that their value will decline in the future. Meanwhile, a stock’s short interest measures the percentage of the instrument’s float that is currently being borrowed. According to data from the number of RIOT shares borrowed by short-sellers increased from 24.44 million in August 2022 to 31.18 million at the end of November 2022. This implies a 30% increase in the Riot Blockchain short interest in just three months. During that same period, the value of RIOT stock has dropped by 35.1%, meaning that short sellers are mostly sitting on profits as short interest has not yet started to decline. As of 30 November, the RIOT stock short interest stood at 18.6%. The days-to-cover metric, which measures the number of days that it would take short-sellers to fully fund their open positions, has moved from 1.5 to 2.8. When short interest is high, the likelihood of a short squeeze increases. A short squeeze happens when the price of a heavily shorted asset surges, forcing short-sellers into closing their positions with a loss, pushing the price even higher. Current headwinds may reduce the likelihood that the value of bitcoin and other digital assets will recover in the near term. Just a few days ago Mazars, one of the few big accounting firms that provide auditing services to cryptocurrency companies and exchanges, said that it will “temporarily pause” its work for crypto clients, including audits of their proof-of-reserves statements. Even though the Riot Blockchain short interest is running high and its days-to-cover metric is at a level that could prompt a Riot Blockchain short squeeze, the absence of a positive catalyst that can push the value of RIOT higher and take short-sellers by surprise reduces the odds of such an event happening. According to data compiled by , the consensus recommendation for Riot Blockchain stock stood at ‘moderate buy’ as of 18 December, with 7 out of 8 analysts rating the stock a ‘buy’ and one a ‘hold’. The average price target for the stock for the next 12 months stood at $14.7 a share, implying 286% upside potential. The highest 12-month target was $46 and the lowest $7. In both November and December, analysts from B. Riley, DA Davidson and Northland Securities lowered their price targets for RIOT stock right after the company issued its latest quarterly report. “The profitability of miners is a discussion that comes up every time bitcoin is down — and then perceived as a problem for all crypto”, commented Anders Kvamme Jensen, the co-fund manager of AKG Digital Assets, to Meanwhile, Chris Crawford, the Chief Investment Officer of Crawford Fund Management, told the media outlet: Note that analysts’ predictions can be wrong and shouldn’t serve as a substitute for your own research. Always conduct your own due diligence on an asset before trading, looking at the latest news, and , and a wide range of commentary. Remember, past performance does not guarantee future returns. And never trade more money than you can afford to lose. As of 30 November, the Riot Blockchain short interest stood at 18.6%, according to data from Even though the RIOT short interest is running high, overall turmoil in the crypto industry could reduce the likelihood of such an event happening in the near future.

SFTBY stock has risen 17% over the past six months, from $18.66 to $21.84 at market close on 19 December 2022. Shareholders are wondering if the could be boosted by its investment in ByteDance, the private Chinese company behind social media giant TikTok? In our SFTBY 5-year stock forecast we look at SoftBank’s results, assess its prospects and ask analysts for their longer-term predictions for the business. SoftBank is a Japanese telecom and e-commerce conglomerate that has been expanding through acquisitions since it was founded in the early 1980s. It now boasts a portfolio of internet-related businesses, as well as being an investor in funds primarily backing pre-IPO companies in this sector. The company’s assets include a 75% holding in ARM Holdings, the semiconductor chip designer, and a 28% stake in Alibaba ( ), the Chinese e-commerce business. SoftBank Corp was listed on the first section of the in January 1998, after demerging its divisions into separate companies and becoming a pure holding company. It’s listed under 9984 on the prime market of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, while trading under the SFTBY ticker in the form of American Depositary Receipts ( ). More broadly, SoftBank has its ambition to “continue to grow as a corporate group” for the next 300 years. It has stated that the company strives to develop over the long-term by forming partnerships with “the brightest minds and industry-shaping companies” in the information industry. Any SoftBank stock 5-year forecast has to begin by looking at how the price has been performing – and this presents a rather mixed picture. Overall, SFTBY stock has fallen 9.4%, from $24.13 at the start of this year to $21.84 at market close on 19 December 2022. There have been highs and lows.The stock price rose from $16.86 at the end of September 2022 to $24.83 by 10 November – a 47% increase. It’s a broadly similar story with the company’s in Tokyo. The price has risen 7% over the past year, from JPY5,344 to JPY5,726. However, this period has seen the price as low as JPY4,265 in mid-March 2022 and above JPY7,000 in early November. Its 9984 stock has generated trailing returns of 7.71% over the past three years, according to data to 19 December 2022. SoftBank is currently the 218th largest company in the world with a market of $62.80bn, according to . It’s also the fourth biggest conglomerate, the sixth largest investment company and the tenth most valuable telecommunications firm by market cap. The SoftBank stock price in 5 years will be influenced by the company’s current positioning and performance. The company net sales of JPY 3,182,477m for the six months to the end of September, 2022, which is 6.7% up on the JPY 2,983,504 for the same period in 2021. Pre-tax profit came in 72% lower at JPY 292,636m, compared to the JPY 1,046,971m for the six months ended 30 September 2021. In statements accompanying the results, the company highlighted losses sustained on investments in SoftBank’s Vision funds. “Investment loss of JPY4,353,542mn was recorded at SoftBank Vision Funds, of which JPY1,018,741mn was attributable to third-party interests,” it stated. Some of the losses were attributable to declines in the share prices of a wide range of companies within the portfolio. “Of the losses, JPY363,856mn were attributable to SenseTime Group, JPY224,541m to DoorDash, and JPY108,247 million to GoTo,” it stated. In a , chief financial officer Yoshimitsu Goto pointed out that the IPO market was “slowly recovering”, which he sees as very good news. “That is giving us much more possibilities for us to see a good improvement in the Vision Fund portfolio performance, which is going to be very positive for the group overall,” he said. Investors are hoping SoftBank’s backing of ByteDance, the private Chinese company, could help support its share price over the next few years. ByteDance operates the hugely popular TikTok, a pioneer in short-form mobile videos that has become a social media sensation over the last few years. TikTok now has offices around the world, including Los Angeles, Berlin, Paris, London, New York, Dubai, Mumbai and Singapore. The business has declared: “Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy.” The performance of investments such as ByteDance are likely to be an influential factor in the SoftBank stock forecast in 5 years. So, what are the SoftBank stock predictions of analysts? According to Dan Baker, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, the company’s first half fiscal year 2022 results were broadly as expected. In his SoftBank stock prediction, he noted the company had “drastically lowered” new investment in Vision funds over the past nine months and reduced leverage with some of its Alibaba sale proceeds. He wrote: Baker pointed out that SoftBank’s investment in Alibaba accounted for around 30% of his estimate of its fair enterprise value. “While we view the Taobao/Tmall marketplaces as Alibaba's core cash flow drivers, we also believe AliCloud and globalisation offer long-term potential,” he said. He also pointed out that SoftBank was previously targeting an IPO of ARM by March 2023 but had now broadened that target to sometime in the coming year. The analyst added: More broadly, SFTBY stock was rated a ‘hold’, based on the views of three analysts compiled by as of 20 December. Two had such recommendations in place, while one saw it as a ‘sell’. However, analysts have been downgrading expectations over recent months, according to an analysis of SoftBank stock predictions. JPMorgan Chase reduced its rating from ‘overweight’ to ‘neutral’. Citigroup moved to ‘neutral’ from ‘buy’. Jefferies Financial Group changed from ‘hold’ to ‘underperform’. What about the SoftBank long-term stock forecast? SFTBY stock was classed as a ‘bad long-term investment’, according to the algorithmic forecasts of As of 20 December, It predicted that the stock could fall 11% over the coming year to $19.46, while its SoftBank stock 5-year forecast had the price down to just $9.38 by December 2027. This would represent a rather dramatic collapse of 57% from its current level. Remember, analysts and algorithm-based predictions can be wrong and shouldn’t be relied upon to substitute your own research. Always conduct your own due diligence before trading, looking at the latest news, and , and a wide range of commentary. Note that past performance does not guarantee future returns. And never trade money you cannot afford to lose. No-one knows for sure as a lot can happen in five years. However, according to the algorithmic Softbank stock projections of as of 20 December, SFTBY stock could fall to $9.38 by December 2027 – 57% lower than the $21.84 closing price on 19 December 2022. Note that their predictions can be wrong. No-one knows for sure as there are so many variables at play. As of 20 December, the algorithmic forecasts of saw the stock falling 11% over the coming year to $19.46. However, it’s important to remember that this figure may be wrong. Whether SoftBank is a good investment for you to consider will depend on a variety of factors, including your risk appetite, investing strategy and portfolio composition. You will need to carry out your own research into the company and remember that analysts’ Softbank stock projections can be wrong. Note that past performance does not guarantee future returns.

{"source": "Capital.com", "title": "Will lithium pop like the cannabis bubble?", "title_link": "https://capital.com/will-lithium-pop-like-the-cannabis-bubble", "published_date": "12:38, 19 December 2022", "author": " Tim Worstall", "Description": "By It’s clear and obvious that lithium is the sexy mining story of our time. But as with the sex appeal of any individual, it does fade over time. The only interesting question is – how long will it take? So, when considering the varied lithium miners we can buy into or trade, how long is it going to take for this story to fade in attraction? One answer might be that it already has. We had a boom in lithium mining investment back in 2013/14 and one of the graduates of that, , has already gone bust. It did get to production, but just couldn’t carry the costs of having got there. There’s no doubt that the energy revolution – those electric vehicles and all that – is going to increase lithium consumption. But that’s not what makes a good investment, not at all. What matters is the balance between new demand and new supply – those little diagrams on page one of the economics’ textbook do actually describe the real world. While we try to decide who’s blowing smoke, let’s talk about smoke, namely the cannabis industry. Humans like getting blasted and have been getting blasted on cannabis sativa for millennia. But only in the past few years has it been legal to grow and sell the stuff in rich nations. So, of course, pent up demand, a vast market, newly legalised – folks have been making like bandits, right? Well, no, that’s not been the experience at all. Sundial ( ) is down from $106 at one point to $2.27, Tilray ( ) has fallen from $148 to $3.26 and Canopy ( ), which hit $67 at one point, is $3.55. Even a company you might think would be hit by legalisation – for example, someone selling hydroponic kits – like iPower (IPW) has done better than that. So, what’s going on here? One part is that the bureaucrats and politicians decided to show us how a properly regulated and organised market would work – which means they’ve achieved the unlikely feat of making the legal stuff both worse quality and higher priced than the still-available black market stuff. All of which is impressive – especially since the quality point means you can now only be arrested for having really good shit. You know, the stuff that obviously cannot possibly be legally procured. But that’s not really why everyone’s finding it so hard to make money here. The cause of that is something much more fundamental. Growing cannabis is so easy that any dope can do it. And when it’s legal, near anybody does. Supply roars up much faster than demand and, as those first couple of pages of ‘Econ 101’ explain, there goes the price and any hope of profits. What we want to know about the lithium market is, well, will it be like this? The answer is yes – we just don’t know when. This means that just as with cannabis, there’s a lovely market bubble to ride. But we need to know that it’s a bubble and that there will be a deflation. That’s OK – we can make money on the way down too, we just have to be correctly positioned. The big secret of minor metals (essentially, all those your grandmother hasn’t heard of, not copper, iron and zinc, but lithium, tantalum and so on) is that there are lots and lots of them out there. I once wrote a pointing this out. The point of which is that we can have shortages at some point in time because we’ve a shortage of people digging it up. But we can solve that problem – firehose more capital and we’ll have more mines and so more of our desired metal or mineral. This is indeed what’s happening, but that firehose (that’s the capital markets allocating more cash to quoted companies to go mine lithium), umm, means that supply is going to rise, the price will crater and we’re back to where we are now with doobies. OK, why might this be wrong? Because not enough of those new mines are going to come to market. But the current lithium price is something like $70,000 a tonne. That’s just too juicy for people not to go mining. So, more mines are going to come online. Some companies will be fine for a goodly time. Albemarle ( ) and SQM ( ) are producing right now – at those humongous margins; margins that their current share prices might well not reflect properly. But, but, but… I know of one mountain that actually has two separate companies trying to mine it – Zinnwald Lithium and European Metals. There are people looking at extracting from geothermal waters (Cornish Lithium, Vulcan, several at the Salton Sea, Wearside) and there’s at least one guy who insists he can mine the Red Sea (he’s right too, but unlikely at a profit). Then there is Atlantic Lithium, Bradda Head and, well, have a look at the lower levels of any of the global markets, you’ll see a rash of lithium companies. One of those rashes that’s not amenable to a little topical cream either. I can think of perhaps 50 and that’s without really hunting. There’s going to be – to my mind at least – overproduction of lithium. And that’s before we start talking about different battery technologies, or solid state lithium, fuel cells, even synthpetrol. On that last one, well, given the current lithium price it’s already true that electric vehicles are more expensive to own and run than petrol and that’s before we consider taxation. So, go short right? Bet on downwards price movements? No. Not yet at least. The point being that just like those cannabis stocks there was money to be made on the upward surge. As there’s also been much to make on the downward slide. The big question is not – again, to my mind – whether the switch is going to happen. The thing we don’t know is when. When should we go from bull to bear on lithium stocks? Umm, sometime. Don’t forget, it’s not when the market moves into oversupply that matters, nor when prices start to fall. Rather, when everyone else thinks that either or both will happen. Stock markets are, after all, forward looking. The real point I’m making here is that demand calls forth supply. While markets are really great things, they do (often enough) call through more supply than will sustain the price. As investors we need to know this of course. And as traders we need to try to work out when. Which is where the difficulty arises of course.

The company has signed a 10-year partnership with Microsoft to revamp its technological infrastructure and offer innovative products and services that rely on the firm’s Azure cloud solution. The London Stock Exchange Group hopes the deal has a positive impact on its finances within the next decade, although it will also result in higher costs in the short term as it plans to spend at least $2.8bn during the contract’s lifetime. In this article, we will be sharing further information about this financial services company along with London Stock Exchange Group share price predictions and commentary from analysts in regards to its prospects. In October 2007, Borsa Italiana and the London Stock Exchange – an institution with more than 300 years of history – merged to create what is now known as the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). The company is a well-diversified financial services firm that generates revenue from three core business activities: : the LSEG provides access to an extensive database containing market data coming out of the exchanges it owns, offering it to sophisticated parties within the financial industry including , , trading desks, and asset management firms. : this unit offers issuers the possibility to raise capital by offering their financial assets on the exchanges and markets it owns and operates including the Main Market and Alternative Investment Market (AIM). : this segment of the business specialises in providing sophisticated solutions to both issuers and investors such as access to over-the-counter (OTC) securities, risk management tools and advisory and services related to regulatory reporting. As of the the data and analytics segment was the most relevant for the LSE Group, generating £1.27bn ($1.57bn) in revenue. This figure accounted for nearly 65% of total revenue (£1.98bn) the firm generated during that quarter. David Schwimmer, CEO of the London Stock Exchange Group, has been with the company since 2018. By the end of 2021, the firm employed more than 23,000 workers to run its operations, the majority of which are based in the US and the UK. Shares of the London Stock Exchange Group were listed on the Main Market in July 2011 under the ticker symbol ‘LSEG’. In the past 10 years, the has increased by 851.1%. During that same period, the value of the FTSE 100 index has risen by just 26.6%. The has been on an uptrend since the year started. The stock has accumulated gains of 9.1% thus far despite the overall weakness equity markets have experienced of late. The chart above indicates that the stock has been making multiple consecutive higher lows since late February. However, the price action has failed to move above the 8,600p level. The more times a resistance is tagged, the higher the possibility that the level will be broken, as long as the lower trend line remains intact. As of 14 December, the price is tagging this lower bound for the fourth time. If that threshold is broken, that could be considered a bearish signal in the near term. Moving forward, the most relevant support levels to watch to draft a plausible London Stock Exchange Group stock forecast are the 7,200p and 6,700p horizontal support lines shown in the chart. The 8,400p and 8,600p levels remain the key resistances to overcome if bulls expect to take control of the price action. The UK economy is expected to enter a recessionary cycle in 2023 as the country’s gross domestic product ( ) is forecast to shrink by 1.3%, according to estimates from . is expected to surge to 11% this year and decelerate to 5% by Q4 2023. Meanwhile, the official set by the Bank of England ( ) is expected to increase from 3% to 5.25% by the end of this same period. All of these factors could have a negative impact on the performance of UK equities, including shares in the London Stock Exchange Group, which indicate a slowdown in the country’s economic activity and growth. Liquidity in has dried up lately as central banks have adopted restrictive to reduce inflation. In an environment of increasingly higher interest rates, companies are typically less willing to raise additional capital as borrowing costs increase, while the value of their equity is negatively affected. During the first half of 2022, the number of initial public offerings ( ) in both the Main Market and AIM dropped by 45%, according to . A total of 26 issuers raised £595m during this period, compared to 47 issuers that raised £9.4bn during the first half of 2021. This situation directly affects the performance of LSEG’s capital markets unit. The armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine remains a risk for all companies in the European region. The war is relevant when it comes to drafting a London Stock Exchange Group share price forecast. Companies could be severely affected if the conflict extends to other countries. The LSEG’s could have a positive influence on the performance of the company’s data and analytics business unit. It could result in the creation of new products and solutions offered to customers. As part of the deal, Microsoft has agreed to purchase 4% of common shares in the LSE Group. This could be interpreted as a sign that the tech company is committed to generating positive results from the partnership. According to LSEG’s leadership, this collaboration “is expected to increase LSEG’s revenue growth meaningfully over time as the key workstreams are delivered”. LSEG CEO David Schwimmer said in regards to Microsoft’s investment in the company: Meanwhile, the head of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, stated: According to , the consensus recommendation for its stock, based on the opinion of 18 analysts as of 1 November, was ‘buy’ – 14 firms rating the stock as such. The average price target stood at 9,304p, implying a 23% upside potential within the next 12 months. As of 14 December, estimates from , a third-party forecasting service, showed the short-term outlook for was bearish, based on an assessment of its technical indicators. The following are the algorithm’s baseline London Stock Exchange Group share price predictions for the next one to three years. : 7,223p : 6,426p In both cases, the mid and long-term outlook for the stock appears to be bearish. The algorithm’s forecasts imply a 4.4% and 14.9% decline in the share price within the next one and three years, respectively. None of these opinions and forecasts should be considered recommendations to invest in LSEG stock. Investors are encouraged to perform adequate due diligence before making any investment decision. Past performance does not guarantee future results. And never invest more than you can afford to lose. The stock of the London Stock Exchange Group has outperformed the British FTSE 100 index in the past 10 years. However, past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investors must analyse the fundamentals and prospects of the business before making any investment decision. No-one can say for sure. According to estimates from Wallet Investor, the baseline LSE share price forecast for 2023 and 2025 is bearish. However, analysts’ consensus rating for the stock was ‘buy’, as of 1 November this year based on their predictions for the stock for the next 12 months. Note that analysts’ predictions can be wrong. Forecasts shouldn’t be used as a substitute for your own research. Always conduct your own due diligence before trading. And never invest or trade money you cannot afford to lose. The decision to invest in any financial asset should only be made after you have assessed the instrument’s prospects and risks along with his/her individual risk tolerance and financial goals.

The offer values the shares at $77 each, according to the latest – a substantial lift in the of $127bn in July. Discussions had ranged up to $85 a share, according to by Reuters, indicating the company’s value has moved back from $150bn. SpaceX has not revealed how much funding it intends to raise from the offering. The SpaceX valuation makes it one of the highest-valued private companies in the US. Founded by Musk in 2002, Space Exploration Technologies designs, manufactures and launches vehicles, rocket engines, spacecraft, and communications satellites. The company aims to commercialise space transportation and enable exploration of the Moon and the colonisation of Mars. SpaceX sends rockets and spacecraft into orbit for private companies, as well as NASA and other government agencies. SpaceX is driving innovation in the use of reusable booster rockets to save on operational costs. The company works on behalf of NASA to transport astronauts to and from the International Space Station and runs private space tourism trips. SpaceX owns the Starlink satellite Internet service provider, which has launched thousands of its satellites into orbit since January 2020, providing Internet connectivity to more than 40 countries. Starlink has enabled Ukraine to maintain Internet access since the Russian invasion in February 2022. As of June, SpaceX said it had 400,000 Starlink subscribers, up from 250,000 in March. SpaceX has received more than $9.8bn from 32 financing rounds, according to data compiled by , as of 14 December. The most recent was a $250m round with three investors in July 2022. SpaceX valuation history indicates that the company’s worth surpassed the $1bn mark in 2010. It has since increased from around $33.3bn in May 2019 to $46bn in August 2020, $100bn in late October 2021 and $127bn in July 2022. SpaceX’s market value has quadrupled in three years. It’s one of the few companies to have gained in value in 2022. At $140bn, the valuation of SpaceX would draw level with ByteDance as the world’s largest unicorn (a startup or private company with a market value over $1bn). It has overtaken aerospace giants Boeing ( ) ($111bn) and Lockheed Martin ( ) ($126bn). SpaceX is among the most in-demand companies for as investors look to gain exposure in their portfolios, according to a by the podcaster and micro VC fund manager Harry Stebbings. Don’t want to jinx it, but SpaceX is positioned to grow strongly, no matter what macroeconomic conditions are like The SpaceX stock valuation in Musk’s personal holdings was around $61.6bn, based on an that he owned a 44% stake in the company, as of December 2022. Musk’s SpaceX holding was in addition to his stakes in Tesla ( ), the Boring Company and Twitter. The increase in SpaceX valuation would boost his net worth by around $7bn, offsetting some of the recent losses in the value of Twitter and Tesla. The share offering aims to help SpaceX employees and shareholders to cash out their shares, according to the reports. SpaceX has often provided for employees and early-stage investors to sell their shares on the secondary market without waiting for the company to list on a public . Musk reportedly that the company could Starlink into a separate publicly-listed business in 2025 or later, once its cash flow is more predictable, to finance its expansion plans. Investors and customers of Tesla and SpaceX have expressed concern that Musk’s acquisition of Twitter has taken his attention away from the other businesses. Tesla’s share price has fallen by 60% this year, in part as Musk has sold shares in the electric vehicle manufacturer to finance his $44bn acquisition of the social media platform. Musk has brought high-level executives and engineers from SpaceX, Tesla and The Boring Company into Twitter to help run the company, according to . Tesla bull Gary Black, managing partner at growth-focused investment advisor The Future Fund, suggested that the share sale is a way for Musk to unlock SpaceX value rather than selling more of his Tesla stock to raise cash to finance Twitter. A positive sign that selling SpaceX shares rather than more at $168. That said, Elon not doing the math if he believes massive decline since he bought TWTR (TSLA -26.5% vs NDX +1.4% since 10/28) is due to Fed int rate hikes and Chinese real estate market. Despite the lofty valuation of SpaceX, there are no indications that the company could go public in the near term. In the past, chief operating officer Gwynne Shotwell that SpaceX is unlikely to go public until it is flying to Mars regularly. Musk has also indicated that the company's long-term objectives are not suited to the short-term demands of public shareholders. If the company does go public in the future, it would be some time after any initial public offering ( ) of Starlink. As a private company, SpaceX does not publicly disclose its revenue, but it could have brought in a few billion dollars from launch sales and the Starlink Internet service. in October that the company’s 2022 revenue could total $3.25bn, comprising $2.27bn from mission launches and $980m from Starlink. The company could need to bring in external capital to cover its costly operations and development, and generate more free cash flow from increasing its Starlink subscriber base. Since its Falcon 9 launch in 2010, SpaceX has pioneered a substantial drop in launch costs that is making space far more accessible. The industry could reach $1trn by 2040, a 5% compound annual growth rate from 2020, according to a : Space investment has previously been dominated by government agencies and the world’s wealthiest countries. But with the growing attention on SpaceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic ( ), increased knowledge and the speed of development, venture capital has become the largest source of investment. Citigroup added: The growing interest from private investors looking to gain exposure to such a rapidly expanding industry that was not previously accessible to private investors could boost SpaceX’s future valuation as it continues to seek more funding.

In his Salesforce stock forecast, the analyst pointed out that the company had “delivered modest upside” during the third quarter. He said: He also appeared optimistic about its future prospects and that margins could continue to climb over the coming months, noting:. “We are impressed by the company’s profitability performance during the quarter and continue to think this should help propel the stock once macro pressures ease.” Romanoff also noted that the non-GAAP operating margin was 22.7%, compared with 19.8% last year and 19.9% in the previous quarter. “Management is committed to hitting its goal of 25% in fiscal 2026 despite current economic challenges,” he said. “We think margins can continue to climb beyond management’s midterm target.” Note that making long-term predictions is a complicated endeavour.

By December 2022, Loeb’s Third Point managed to place its candidate on the Disney board to advocate for proposals, such as the spin-off of sports broadcaster ESPN. While Peltz’s Trian Partners was reported to be keen on increasing its Disney stake to gain a sizable influence on the company’s future roadmap. Furthermore, the comeback of Robert Iger as Disney chief executive in November 2022 means that shareholders can expect interesting times for the company in 2023. Here we take a look at and the latest company news. The Walt Disney Company is an entertainment firm best known for its iconic Mickey Mouse cartoon and popular amusement parks. The company originally started as an animation studio in 1923 before opening amusement parks and producing live-action films in the 1950s. Disney issued its first over-the-counter stock in 1940. In 1957, the company conducted an initial public offering ( ) on the New York Stock Exchange ( ) at a price of $13.88 per share. Over the decades, Disney became an entertainment juggernaut following the acquisition of Toy Story animator Pixar in 2006, Spiderman cartoon producer Marvel Entertainment in 2009, Star Wars creator Lucasfilm in 2015 and National Geographic channel owner 21st Century Fox in 2019. The company’s media and entertainment assets include sports broadcaster ESPN, subscription streaming services Hulu and Disney+, and television network ABC. Historical study shows Disney’s six-year rally between March 2009 and August 2015. During the period, the stock surged by as much as 700% from a then six-year low of about $15 in March 2009 to a high of $122 by August 2015. After its 2015 high, Disney stock price started seeing weakness as competition in the video entertainment sector heated up. In parallel, streaming service Netflix ( ) emerged as Disney’s biggest threat with growing popularity and in-house content production capabilities. The end of 2019 brought new challenges for Disney’s business model in the form of a pandemic. The Covid-19 lockdowns that followed in 2020 sent Disney shares crashing to a multi-year low of $79 in March 2020. Investors fretted over the closure of Disney World and related theme parks and resorts that had contributed over 37% of the company’s revenue in the . However, Disney’s vast home entertainment library and its growing market share of streaming services such as Disney+, Hulu and Hotstar came to its rescue. The company’s reported its direct-to-consumer and international revenue rose 81% from a year ago to nearly $17bn. The easing of Covid-19 lockdowns allowed Disney’s theme parks to reopen, supporting the stock’s surge to an all-time high of $203 by March 2021. In 2022, Disney stock value endured a prolonged downtrend from the start of the year as the pandemic tailwinds for its streaming services faded and business conditions soured due to high inflation and rising interest rates. On 9 November 2022, Disney stock saw its worst intraday session in over 20 years following disappointing Disney news on the earnings front. Disney slumped 13.1% in a single session after missing analyst earnings expectations. The company said quarterly operating loss at its unprofitable direct-to-consumer streaming business widened from $0.8bn to $1.5bn in the fourth quarter of 2022. Disney closed 9 November 2022 at $86.75, its lowest since March 2020. At the time of writing on 13 December 2022, Disney share price had recovered to over $94. 2022 has also been a year for activist investors at Disney. In August 2022, billionaire investor Daniel Loeb’s hedge fund, Third Point, disclosed a near $1bn stake in Walt Disney. Loeb pressed on a number of agendas, including spinning off sports channel ESPN and acquiring the remaining stake in streaming service Hulu ahead of its planned acquisition in 2024. While the market is not quite sure if Loeb’s proposed changes will be implemented, the hedge fund owner has managed to get his candidate on the Disney board. On 30 September, Disney to appoint Carolyn Everson, former marketing solutions head of Meta Platforms ( ), to join the entertainment giant’s 12-member board. Later in November cited inside sources in revealing that activist investor Nelson Peltz’s hedge fund, Trian Fund Management, had acquired a stake worth more than $800m in Disney. That Disney stock news came around the same time the company as the chief executive of Disney on 20 November. Iger had spent over four decades at the company, including 15 years as its CEO, before retiring in 2020. The WSJ report said that activist investor Peltz were in favour of having Iger back as Disney’s head. Peltz and Trian Partners were also looking to increase their stake in Disney to gain more influence on company proceedings. The WSJ report suggested that Trian Partners’ stake in Disney was less than the 5% disclosure threshold. Trian Partners is also seeking a place as a Disney activist investor in order to push for improvements and cost-cutting measures. The market reacted positively to news of Iger’s comeback and Peltz’s activist investor stake. Disney saw its best intraday gain on 21 November 2022 as the stock closed 6.3% higher. Investors were hopeful that Iger’s experience and activist investor pressure could shape Disney’s future stock price prospects. Investment research firm Morningstar analyst a “stunning move”. Macker said Iger’s close relationship with Hollywood will help “lighten some of the relationship strain that arose from the pandemic\". During former Disney CEO Bob Chapek’s tenure, the company was sued by actor Scarlett Johansson for releasing the movie ‘Black Widow’ on its subscription streaming service. While Iger was expected to make changes to how Disney was run under Chapek, Macker said Iger will continue to “emphasise the central role of streaming at Disney.” In a 13 December note, Morningstar lowered its fair value estimate for Disney stock to $155. The agency said: When looking for Disney stock forecasts, it’s important to bear in mind that analysts’ forecasts can be wrong.

Indian equities have outperformed most of their global peers in 2022, on bets that the world’s fifth-largest economy will remain largely shielded from recessions in the US and Europe. Going into 2023, India’s strong economic growth is expected to support its market despite tightened monetary conditions. However, there were a few concerns over the “steep valuations” of the Nifty 50 index (NIFTY50) constituents. How is India’s NSE NIFTY 50 index expected to trade in 2023? Learn more in our NIFTY 50 forecast for 2023 and beyond. A detailed sector breakdown for the NIFTY 50 index could offer investors more clarity on what factors may shape the NIFTY 50 forecast in 2022. The NIFTY 50 is a diversified 50-stock index made up of some of the biggest publicly listed companies in India. It is computed using the ‘free float market capitalisation’ method, which takes into account only active shares and excludes inactive, locked-in company shares. Alongside the 30-member blue-chip S&P BSE Sensex index, the NIFTY 50 is one of India’s benchmark equity market indices. The index are rebalanced, if needed, on a semi-annual basis. As of the end of November 2022, the Nifty 50 index has returned about 14.3% on a total return basis over the past five years. The financial services sector dominated the Nifty 50 index with a sector weight of 37.1% as of 30 November 2022. Information technology, oil, gas and consumable fuels, and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) followed with sector weights of about 14.4%, 13% and 8.6%, respectively. Oil-to-telecoms conglomerate Reliance Industries was the NIFTY 50’s largest single constituent with a weight of 11.4%, as of 30 November 2022. Private lenders HDFC Bank ( ) and ICICI Bank ( ) followed with index weights of 8.5% and 8%, respectively. Information technology firm Infosys ( ) fell out of the top three index constituents following the company’s oversized market losses in 2022 and came in fourth with an index weight of about 7.2%. Housing Development Finance Corp closed the top five spots at 5.9%. It should be noted that HDFC Bank and HDFC are expected to complete their merger in 2023, which should prompt a rejig in the top constituents list. The other companies in the Nifty 50 index top 10 list were technology services giant Tata Consultancy Services, lender Kotak Mahindra Bank, cigarettes-to-hotels company ITC and engineering services conglomerate Larsen & Toubro. FMCG giant Hindustan Unilever pipped Axis Bank ( ) to take its place among the top 10 constituents on the Nifty 50 index, as of 30 November 2022. In early 2020, when the world was still coming to terms with the seriousness of an epochal pandemic, the NIFTY 50 crashed nearly 40% to a then four-year low of 7,511 points on 24 March 2020. As cut and governments released fiscal stimulus to support economies, the flush of liquidity in the market fuelled a fast-paced rally in global equities. The NIFTY 50 had recovered all its losses from its four-year low by early November 2020. The index went on to scale multiple record peaks in 2021. Each time the NIFTY 50 index fell in 2021, it came back stronger as investors saw dips as an opportunity to accumulate positions. Rebounds from buy-the-dip investing were prevalent even when the NIFTY 50 saw weakness after a second Covid-19 wave pushed fresh cases to over 300,000 a day in India. By October 2021, the NIFTY 50 had surged to an all-time high of 18,604 points. The index had rallied more than 147% from its low in March 2020. The strength of retail investors was a major factor in the index’s bull run, with reports suggesting there were 14.3 million new investors in the 2021 fiscal year. The NIFTY 50 began to see weakness as foreign institutional investors (FII) started pulling capital out of Indian markets. Data from Jefferies showed foreign investors have been net sellers of Indian equities for nine straight months from October 2021 to June 2022. The index fell to 15,183 points on 17 June 2022, its lowest in over a year, as the US Federal Reserve embarked on an aggressive 75-basis-points rate hike for the first time since 1994. The NIFTY 50 index rebounded strongly to gain 21% and trade at more than 18,400 by 15 December 2022. Much of the NIFTY 50 index’s strong performance over the year can be contributed to gains posted by the Indian financial sector. The sub-index NIFTY Bank posted year-to-date (YTD) gains of 19% as of 15 December 2022, compared with the NIFTY 50 index’s YTD gain of 4.3%. A credit up-cycle in India has boosted the prospect of Indian banks. Investment firm Jefferies has put the aggregate bank credit In India at close to INR130trn in November 2022, up from less than INR100trn a year ago. A return of foreign institutional money into the Indian market has also helped the Nifty 50 index rise to a new all-time high in 2022. Net foreign portfolio investor flows turned positive in July 2022 after nine consecutive months of outflows. Foreign institutions were net buyers of Indian equities in four of five months between July and November 2022, data from Jefferies showed. On 1 December 2022, the NIFTY 50 index hit an all-time high of 18,887 points. At the time of writing on 15 December, the benchmark index was trading 2.5% lower than its peak at 18,414 points. ANZ Research said in a note that India presented a “compelling structural narrative” on the back of the Indian government’s commitment to strengthening the nation’s industrial and manufacturing sector. Policymakers in India are focused on raising the share of manufacturing in India’s gross domestic product (GDP) to as much as 25% by March 2026, according to ANZ Research. The strategies in place look to take advantage of India’s favourable demographics, combined with geo-political tensions in China. According to ANZ Research, the immediate concern for India is its deteriorating onshore liquidity, highlighted by the rising loan-deposit ratio in the nation’s banking system and a 67% drop in India’s foreign currency reserves since the third-quarter of 2021. “The emerging dilemma for the RBI is to choose between a weaker rupee or tighter liquidity. We believe that policymakers will opt for a middle-road strategy – reduce intervention and tolerate further depreciation of the rupee and allow for some upward adjustment in rates,” said ANZ Research in a 2 November 2022 note. Inflation in India has been showing signs of easing. The for November 2022 revealed that headline inflation increased by 5.8% during the month compared to a pace of 6.7% reported in October 2022. The provisional data showed inflation in India came within the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tolerance band of 2% to 6% for the first time in 10 months in November 2022. Although the signs were encouraging, the RBI “further calibrated monetary policy action is warranted to keep inflation expectations anchored, break the core inflation persistence and contain second-round effects” on 7 December 2022, after hiking benchmark lending rates by 35 basis points to 6.25%. Analysts at Jefferies saw the RBI hiking rates by another 50 to 75 basis points in the months to come. Jefferies added that “the developed-world phenomenon of rising rates impacting growth through a slowdown in property markets and corporate spending won’t happen in India” due to low corporate sector debt and high pent-up property demand in India. According to a NIFTY 50 prediction by ICICI Securities on 15 December, the Indian benchmark index is expected to “maintain its northbound trajectory and challenge the all-time high”. The brokerage saw the near 19,400 points by January 2023. ICICI Securities added that the broader market was expected to outperform the benchmark index. Meanwhile, Hemang Jani, head of equity strategy at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said in a NIFTY 50 forecast on 15 December: Elsewhere, Jefferies in its report said the Nifty 50 index could stay rangebound between 17,000 and 19,500 points due to its “steep valuations”. Finally, data provider NIFTY 50 forecast indicated a bearish outlook, suggesting the index could fall to 17,955 by the end of December 2022. Its long-term NIFTY 50 prediction saw the index falling to 16,422 in one year from 15 December 2022.

The top 10 football clubs by market capitalisation feature four from Portugal, two from Italy, and one each from the UK, Germany, France and Denmark, according to . So, what are the publicly traded top football clubs around the world that people can invest in? We start our list by looking at the five largest football stocks, give an insight into their histories, and consider football clubs stocks to watch over the coming months. Manchester United has a truly global fanbase. Star players, such as George Best and David Beckham, became household names by virtue of their performances on the pitch. The club has been crowned UEFA Champions League champion (previously the European Cup) on three occasions. This is the ultimate club competition in European football. It has also picked up a record 13 Premier League titles, along with seven First Division championships, 12 FA Cups, and five League Cups. Since the start of this year, the stock price has risen 47%, as of 14 December. Juventus is one of the biggest names in Italian football.

This list includes 14 Coppa Italias, 36 official league titles and nine Supercoppa Italianas. International honours include two European Champion Clubs, two Intercontinental Cups, three UEFA Cups, one European Cup Winners, two UEFA Super Cups and one UEFA Intertoto Cup. Since the start of this year, the JUVE stock price has fallen 23% year-to-date ( ). The German team was founded in December 1909 and plays in the Bundesliga, the country’s top tier football league. Its list of honours include being eight-times Bundesliga champions, as well as having won the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Cup Winners Cups. The club had the biggest average matchday attendances in Germany during the 2021/22 season of 41,800, according to . YTD, its stock price has fallen 19% in 2022.

FC Copenhagen’s included being in the top three of the league, building a local fanbase, and playing attractive, positive football. Sof far this year, its stock price has fallen 9.6%.

This Portuguese club, more commonly known as Benfica, has won a host of national and international titles since being founded in the early 1900s. Its stock price has fallen 17% in 2022.

Its list of honours includes winning the UEFA Champions League and Europa League titles twice. Since the start of this year, the stock price has risen 14%. Few things are more fulfilling as a football fan than holding shares in a club that you love – almost irrespective of its performance on the stock market. However, prospective investors must be prepared for a very rocky ride – the most successful teams one year could be easily beaten the next. When investing in football stocks, you should carry out thorough research. You should always conduct your own . Look at the latest news, , and a wide range of analysts’ opinions before making any trading decision. Keep in mind that past performance is no guarantee of future returns. And never trade money that you cannot afford to lose. There are around 15 clubs in which investors can buy shares. Most of these football stocks are quoted on prominent UK and European stock markets, while some can only be found on specialist exchanges. The quoted names include some of the most prominent clubs in world football. This all depends on what metric you use. For example, Manchester City was the highest revenue generating club in 2020/21 with €644.9m. However, local rivals Manchester United is the largest quoted club by market capitalisation of $3.43bn. This will depend on your view of the sport – and the viability of investing. The biggest clubs spend billions of pounds every year on footballing talent, yet it’s a notoriously volatile industry where success on the pitch isn’t guaranteed. For many investors it’s a passion rather than a money maker. Always conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decision. And never invest or trade money you cannot afford to lose.
