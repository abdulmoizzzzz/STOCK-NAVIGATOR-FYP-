What’s going on with the share price of this FTSE 250 British icon?", "title_link": "https://www.fool.co.uk/2024/07/03/down-14-last-month-whats-going-on-with-the-share-price-of-this-ftse-250-british-icon/", "published_date": "3 July, 2024", "publisher_name": "Mark David Hartley", "Description": "I’m digging deep to discover why this wildly popular  FTSE 250  stalwart lost 14% of its share price last month.  Tate & Lyle ’s ( LSE: TATE ) a 100-year-old household name in kitchens and bakeries across the nation. Its golden syrup is renowned in the UK as the preferred option for cookies, tarts and puddings.  But since rebranding in 2023, the food and beverage manufacturer has faced some hurdles. A push to become more sustainable and appeal to health-conscious consumers is proving costly. It could pay off in the long run – but it won’t be an easy challenge. Strong growth Despite positive results in late May, Tate & Lyle shares fell that 14% in June. That brings its total share price losses to 17% since announcing those latest FY earnings. Despite a 2% drop in revenue, earnings per share (EPS) rose to 45p from 31p, beating analysts’ expectations by 8.8%. Profit margins and net income also grew by 7.3% and 41% respectively. It also announced the completion of the sale of its remaining stake in Primient, a high fructose corn syrup brand. The move will help it focus fully on its more profitable speciality food and beverage division. As is common with divestments of this sort, net proceeds have been tipped to fund a share buyback programme. That should be good news for investors, assuring a large influx of cash into the stock. So why the drop? With all the good news, investors would expect the shares to be soaring, not falling. So why the loss? One reason may be the announcement that the company plans to buy CP Kelco for £1.5bn. The acquisition would form part of the shift in focus towards more sustainable and healthier food. Kelco sells pectin and similar nature-based gums and ingredients. However, the acquisition is out of the ordinary for a company like Tate & Lyle. It’s a lot of money considering it only has a £2.4bn market-cap and already holds half a million in debt. Shareholders may fear dividends could be cut to help fund the acquisition. Growth in the face of competition Whatever the reason for the price drop, it means Tate & Lyle shares now appear to me to be bargains. Based on future cash flow estimates, the shares are undervalued by 42%. And with a  price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio  of 13.2, that’s well below the industry average of 18 and has lots of space to grow. Subsequently, there’s a good consensus among analysts that the share price will increase 40% in the coming 12 months. But it’s not the only food producer in the UK. It faces stiff competition from other brands that are arguably already more sustainable.  Premier Foods  is a slightly smaller outfit that’s enjoyed 318% growth in the past five years. Known for  Mr Kipling’s  cakes and  Oxo  cubes, it already has a well-established ‘Enriching Life’ sustainability initiative in action since 2020. Tate & Lyle will need to play a game of catch-up if it hopes to compete. The price looks cheap and the company has strong value in its established brands. But pivoting to appeal to a new generation of more health-conscious consumers will surely test the company’s reserves. Nonethless, I think it’s worth consideration."},

Which should I buy in July?", "title_link": "https://www.fool.co.uk/2024/07/03/2-dirt-cheap-ftse-100-shares-which-should-i-buy-in-july/", "published_date": "3 July, 2024", "publisher_name": "Royston Wild", "Description": "The  FTSE 100 ’s risen by around 6% so far this year. This is thanks in large part to improving buying interest from value investors. Even including those recent gains, the Footsie has lagged other major global share indices for several years now. It means that many top UK blue-chip shares can still be picked up at rock-bottom prices. However, some large-cap companies are cheap for good reason. And investors need to be careful to avoid these like the plague. Take the following  FTSE 100  stocks, for instance. Are they brilliant bargains or could they turn out to be investor traps? Barclays Right now,  Barclays  ( LSE:BARC ) shares offer excellent all-round value, at least on paper. The high street bank trades on a forward  price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio  of 6.7 times. Meanwhile, its dividend yield for this year sits at an attractive 4.1%. Barclays’ US operations could provide it with excellent opportunities to grow earnings. It also has a substantial investment bank. However, the business is also dependent on a strong UK economy to drive the bottom line. In 2023, its domestic banking and credit card operations made up almost 40% of group profits. This is a concern to me given the huge structural problems that are strangling British GDP growth. So I still have huge reservations about buying its shares. But this is not my only worry. I’m also put off by the rising competitive pressures it’s facing across the world. Challenger bank Revolut announced on Tuesday (2 July) that the number of retail customers on its books soared 45% in 2023, to 38m. Its capacity to steal customers from established banks like Barclays will grow too if — as expected — Revolut secures a UK banking licence in the near future. With a spate of IPOs being lined up by fintech businesses, the banking landscape could be about to change significantly. WPP WPP  LSE:WPP The advertising agency has had its fair share of troubles more recently. Weak spending from the US tech sector — combined with the impact of China’s slowdown — remains a threat. So do fundamental changes in the way companies choose to advertise their goods and services. More and more firms are bringing their marketing activities in-house. Some public relations specialists are also pulling their tanks onto WPP’s lawn by offering advertising services. Yet I still believe WPP has considerable investment potential. Operating in more than 100 countries, it has significant scope to harness rapid economic growth in emerging markets. Rising investment in digital advertising and e-commerce also sets it up nicely for the digital revolution. Finally, WPP has expertise in multiple areas including advertising, public relations and brand consulting. This makes it a trusted and evergreen supplier for end-to-end services with some of the world’s biggest companies. Like Barclays, WPP shares offer solid value, on paper. They trade on a forward P/E ratio of 8 times and carry a 5.3% dividend yield. It’s a share I’ll consider buying if I have spare cash to invest this July."},

[Just beginning your investing journey? Check out our guide on  how to start investing in the UK .] Ashtead Technology Holdings What it does: Ashtead Technology is a subsea equipment rental company operating globally in both offshore wind and oil and gas markets.    By  Ben McPoland . Given its double-digit dip since May,  Ashtead Technology  ( LSE: AT. ) stock now looks attractive to me. In 2023, the firm’s revenue surged 51% year on year to £110m, with growth across all its geographic markets. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) rocketed 73% to 33.4p. It also acquired ACE Winches in November, bolstering its vast offerings of offshore rental equipment. That said, acquisitions have increased its net debt over the last few years, which is worth keeping an eye on. As I write, the stock’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is about 19. I think that looks attractive, especially as The City sees the company’s revenue nearly doubling to £200m by the end of 2026. Looking further ahead, the firm appears to be in the sweet spot. Not only are companies increasingly opting to rent equipment to lower capital expenditure, but the energy transition means both the decommissioning of oil and gas infrastructure and offshore wind markets are tipped for strong future growth. Ben McPoland owns shares of  Ashtead Technology. James Halstead What it does: James Halstead is a manufacturer and international distributor of floor coverings By  Paul Summers . The AIM isn’t exactly overburdened with high-quality companies but there are a few diamonds in the rough. One example, in my view, is floor covering specialist  James Halstead  ( LSE: JHD ).  Having generated consistently excellent returns on the money it puts to work, this firm has delivered great gains for long-term holders. That said, the last two years have been tough for the share price as inflationary pressures have kicked in. But I think we’re past the worst. Supporting this, the company announced in March that pre-tax profit had climbed 18% to £27.4m for the second half of 2023. At a pretty expensive valuation of 19 times forecast FY25 earnings, things could get nasty if I’m wrong. Then again, a strong balance sheet suggests Halstead should be able to weather any further storms. There’s a chunky 4.5% dividend yield too.  I reckon this is one to consider tucking away. Paul Summers has no position in James Halstead Volex What it does: Volex is a manufacturing company that specialises in power cords and data transmission cables. It serves customers in the data centre, consumer electronics, healthcare, and electric vehicle (EV) markets.  By  Edward Sheldon, CFA . One investment theme I’m really excited about right now is the global data centre buildout. Across the world, large technology companies are building data centres everywhere to handle the huge amount of data being generated today (and use it for things like artificial intelligence).  Volex  ( LSE: VLX ) strikes me as a great way to play this theme. A manufacturing company, it generates a decent chunk of its revenues from the production of power cords and data transmission cables for data centres. And sales from this side of the business are growing fast. In H1 FY2024, for example, revenues in its ‘Complex Industrial Technology’ division grew by a huge 30.1% on an organic basis to $101m (about 25% of total revenues).  It’s worth noting that sales in its other divisions have not been growing as quickly. In H1 FY2024, revenues from its EV division actually declined. Low or negative growth from these divisions could be a risk going forward.  With the stock trading at a low earnings multiple, however, I like the risk/reward setup.  Edward Sheldon owns shares in Volex"},
{"source_name": "The Motley Fool", "title": "£9,000 in savings? Here’s how I’d aim to turn it into an £11,932 annual passive income with Legal & General shares", "title_link": "https://www.fool.co.uk/2024/07/03/9000-in-savings-heres-how-id-aim-to-turn-it-into-an-11932-annual-passive-income-with-legal-general-shares/", "published_date": "3 July, 2024", "publisher_name": "Simon Watkins", "Description": "Legal & General  ( LSE: LGEN ) shares were one of my first investments (many years ago), and I still have them. They introduced me to the pleasure of receiving regular payments for doing nothing more arduous than just owning a stock. This was called ‘passive income’ I found out, and I have been a big fan of the concept ever since. Unlike out-and-out growth shares, stocks that pay dividends provide a return without having to sell them. Those payments can pave the way for a much better quality of life, in my experience, and even early retirement. How much can be made? In 2023, Legal & General paid a total dividend of 20.34p. The shares are currently priced at £2.27, so that gives a yield of 9%. £9,000 today – the same as I started with 30 years ago – invested at 9% would make £810 this year. So, over 10 years this would make an extra £8,100, provided the yield averaged the same. Not bad certainly. But as I discovered early on thankfully, it could be a lot more than that through ‘dividend compounding’. This involves using the dividends paid to buy more of the shares that paid them. In Legal & General’s case, doing this would make £13,062 extra after 10 years instead of £8,100. 30 years from now, if the yield averaged the same, £123,575 would have been added to the initial £9,000 investment. So the £132,575 investment pot would be generating £11,932 in dividends every year! Strong core business? To support this level of return long term, the company will need to be making good earnings and profits. One risk in the company is that its 3.8 debt-to-equity ratio is higher than the 2.5 or so considered healthy for investment firms. Another is a new global financial crisis. However, at its 12 June Capital Markets Event, it announced a 6%-9% compound annual growth rate target in earnings per share to 2027. It is also aiming for £5bn-£6bn cumulative Solvency II operational surplus generation to that point. And it intends to increase shareholder rewards. Part of this will be a 5% increase in dividends this year, followed by 2% a year to 2027. The other part will be its first share buyback (of £200m) this year, followed by further buybacks. How does the share price look? Of course, there is no point in making these big dividends if they are erased by big share price losses. This is why I always buy shares that look undervalued compared to their competitors, as it reduces the chance of this happening. Legal & General looks cheap to me trading at a  price-to-book  ratio (P/B) of 2.8 against a peer group average of 3.4. I ran a  discounted cash flow  analysis to ascertain how cheap it is, using other analysts’ figures and my own. This shows the shares to be 58% undervalued at the current price of £2.27. Consequently, a fair value for Legal & General shares would be around £5.45. This does not mean that they will reach that price, of course. But it signals to me that they are significantly undervalued. If I did not already own the shares, I would buy them today. I think the company’s growth prospects, undervaluation, and high yield are too good to pass up."},

These small-cap companies are often young companies with limited financial resources. What’s more, because they are at the beginning of their life cycle, they tend to reinvest any spare cash to boost growth.  Dividends  are a very distant consideration. However, there are exceptions to this rule, a few of which are shown in the table below. Company Forward dividend yield  HSS Hire Group  ( LSE:HSS )  7.8%   Topps Tiles  ( LSE:TPT )  7.2%   Anglo Asian Mining  ( LSE:AAZ )  4.1% Of course, dividends are never, ever guaranteed. But if broker projections are correct, a £20,000 lump sum invested equally across these  penny stocks  would make me a £1,280 passive income this year alone. There’s a good chance too that they could grow their dividends over time. Here’s why I think they’re worth a close look today. HSS Hire Group Construction companies across the globe are changing the way they operate. Rather than buying their own heavy equipment, many are choosing to rent instead in increasingly large numbers. The advantages are numerous: the avoidance of large initial costs, no storage concerns or maintenance expenses, and better equipment tailoring for specific projects. It’s a trend that should benefit businesses like HSS going forwards. This operator is expanding rapidly to capitalise on this trend as well. It opened 29 new builders’ merchants last year to take the total to 89. I think it could be a great buy despite current weakness in the UK economy. Topps Tiles Like HSS Group, building materials supplier Topps Tiles is also vulnerable to a subdued construction sector. It also faces significant competition from the likes of  Kingfisher -owned B&Q and  Travis Perkins . But I still think earnings could surge given the bright outlook for UK homebuilding over the next decade. Britain needs to rev up residential construction to meet the needs of its growing population. Indeed, the Labour Party — favourites to win this week’s general election — has vowed to build 1.5m homes over the next five years. This could support large and growing dividends from Topps Tiles for years to come. Anglo Asian Mining Copper miner Anglo Asian Mining hasn’t had the best of things more recently. Production has fallen sharply as it awaits regulatory approval for some of its operations. More specifically, it’s seeking the green light to raise a tailings dam wall. The company isn’t out of the woods yet. But it received a positive environmental report from Azerbaijan’s government last month to carry out its work. Now could be the time to buy a stake in the company, then. Copper miners like this have excellent long-term investment potential. Their product is used extensively in fast-growing sectors like renewable energy, computing, electric vehicles, and construction. And with supply shortages opening up, prices of the red metal are tipped by many industry experts to explode."},

In some cases, investors are right to be pessimistic. But in others, short-term headwinds are dragging down market-caps despite long-term potential remaining intact. That certainly appears to be the case with  Safestore Holdings  ( LSE:SAFE ), in my opinion. And based on its latest results, time may be running out to snap up shares at today’s cheap prices. What’s going on? As a self-storage operator, Safestore generates revenue by leasing space to individual families as well as businesses. Generally speaking, it’s a relatively sticky business model. After all, even if the economy decides to throw a tantrum, moving things out of storage usually isn’t ideal. However, when household budgets are stretched too thin, this stickiness starts to wear off. And that’s exactly what we’ve seen over the last two years, with Safestore’s occupancy shrinking from 84.5% in October 2021 to 74.4% as of April. Obviously, that’s a problem. And while pricing has prevented a massive slide in revenue generation, higher debt servicing costs and inflation have taken a toll on underlying profit margins. Now, pair all this with the downturn in the real estate market due to higher interest rates. Suddenly, a 40% slide in the stock price over the last two years makes a lot of sense. But have we reached the bottom? The opportunity ahead As frustrating as it is to watch a company from my own portfolio take a hit, Safestore’s actually in better shape than many believe. The whole self-storage industry has been suffering from occupancy declines, and Safestore’s proven to be notably more resilient than its closest competitors. At the same time, even with weaker margins,  free cash flow generation  remains strong, providing ample coverage for dividends. In fact, even in these adverse conditions, management has hiked shareholder payouts once again for the 15th year in a row. Therefore, dividends don’t appear to be at risk right now. But of course, it begs the question as to when the share price will recover. Sadly, there’s no way of accurately predicting this. Yet, it’s worth pointing out that among the latest results, the group’s property portfolio valuation actually increased. In other words, the commercial real estate market has started to recover – a trend that’s likely to accelerate once interest rate cuts emerge. With the economy as a whole also ramping back up, the cyclical downturn in self-storage may soon come to an end. It may have even already started, given management expects to return to growth by the end of 2024. Time to buy? Even with the slide in its valuation, Safestore’s delivered over 600% total gains to shareholders over the last 10 years. That makes it one of the best-performing dividend shares on the entire  London Stock Exchange ! However, even when market conditions improve, there are still risks to account for. This is hardly the last cyclical downturn that Safestore will have to navigate. And with the firm expanding into international territories, it’s opening up to new forms of competition that could impede progress. Nevertheless, management’s track record speaks for itself. And given its long-term income-generating potential, it might be a good time to top up my existing position. I’m currently considering it."},

A key reason is the much larger passive income I can make from the former. There is also a much greater chance of their making price gains as well, I think. Big passive income generator ? £10,000 would currently buy me 1,453 shares in the bank. Analysts’ expectations are that its total dividend by the end of this year will be 65p a share. This does not include the special 17p dividend announced earlier this year following the sale of its Canadian business. This 65p payout would give a yield of a stunning 9.4% — one of the highest in the  FTSE 100 . At this rate, my HSBC shares would pay me £940 in dividends in the first year. After 10 years, I would have made an extra £9,400 in dividends. This is provided the yield averaged the same and that I removed my money each year from my investment pot. However, if I used those dividends instead to buy more HSBC shares then I would make a lot more than that. By doing this (‘dividend compounding’) I would have an extra £15,506 instead of £10,097! After 30 years on the same average yield, the total investment pot would be worth £165,935. This would pay me £14,832 a year by that point, or £1,236 each month! Potential share price gain too ? When buying high-dividend-paying stocks, I look carefully at their share price valuation. If it looks undervalued, there is less chance of my dividend gains being wiped out by sustained share price losses. I also stand a greater chance of making money from a share price rise as well. HSBC trades on the key  price-to-earnings  (P/E) stock valuation measurement at 7.2. This compares to a UK peer group average of 7.3, so it looks slightly undervalued on that basis. However, it looks even cheaper against its European peer group average of 7.7. So, how cheap is it? A comprehensive  discounted cash flow  analysis shows HSBC to be 53% undervalued right now. Therefore, a fair value would be £14.64, although there is no guarantee it will ever reach that level. How does the business look? Like all firms, its share price and dividend are supported by earnings and profits. The main risk for the bank is a declining net interest margin (NIM), in line with falling interest rates. The NIM is the difference between the interest a bank receives on loans and the rate it pays for deposits. However, its Q1 2024 results showed revenue up 24% year on year (to $20.8bn), while net income rose 2.5% over the same period (to $10.6bn). Right now, analysts’ estimates are that revenue will grow at 3.5% a year to end-2026. Return on equity is forecast to be 12.3% by that time. I will buy more HSBC shares simply for the potential high yield. But the likelihood in my view of a significant share price rise over time adds further weight to my decision."},

But there are still some terrific opportunities for investors looking for stocks to buy.  The best businesses can do well regardless of the political landscape. Since I think the UK has plenty of these, I’d look to invest today, rather than waiting for the outcome of the election. Election investing The odds of a Labour majority are currently 1:33. That’s a lot shorter than the odds on the current favourite for the US election – Donald Trump – which are priced at 8:13. I’m not taking a view about how desirable either outcome would be. But that’s why UK stocks have been holding up well recently.  In general,  the stock market  isn’t that bothered about who will win which election. What it cares much more about is having clarity about the outcome. It’s the same with most macroeconomic issues. It’s much easier for investors to deal with predictable 5% interest rates than with uncertainty over whether they will be 2% or 4%.  That’s why UK share prices have been less volatile than their US counterparts over the last few weeks. But there are still stocks that I’m looking to buy at today’s prices. Rentokil Initial The involvement of activist investor Nelson Peltz at  Rentokil Initial  ( LSE:RTO ) has sent the share price up recently. And that’s made it more difficult to buy the stock than it was before. I’ve had to reconsider my approach to the stock, but I’ve come to the conclusion it still looks like a decent investment. I think company’s strengths outweigh the additional risk.  Rentokil has a dominant position in an industry that is – unfortunately – steadily growing. And it’s working hard to consolidate that position, which is a good sign for the long term.  The company has some debt on its balance sheet to work off after a big acquisition a couple of years ago. But when it does, I think it will be in a terrific position for long-term investors. Primary Health Properties Waiting times for GP appointments is a key election issue, but everybody seems to be committed to reducing them. That’s good news for  Primary Health Properties  ( LSE:PHP ).  The company is a  real estate investment trust (REIT)  that owns a portfolio of GP surgeries. More doctors probably means higher demand for its buildings, which is a good thing.  This is another company where debt is a risk. As a REIT, it isn’t able to manage its debt in the way that Rentokil does, so if interest rates don’t fall it might have to issue more shares. Right now, the stock has a 6.5% dividend yield. Even if that gets cut in half – which I think is the absolute worst that could happen – there’s still a decent passive income return on offer. Please note that tax treatment depends on the individual circumstances of each client and may be subject to change in future. The content in this article is provided for information purposes only. It is not intended to be, neither does it constitute, any form of tax advice. How I’d invest £1,000 Rentokil Initial and Primary Health Properties both come with risks. But spreading a £1,000 investment between the two companies would help limit the overall effect on my portfolio. I think both companies operate in industries with good long-term characteristics. So whatever happens in the election, I expect both stocks to turn out to be good investments."},

This comes hot on the heels of an update from the Bank of England (BoE)   that contained a warning for investors. The bank noted that investors are  “placing less weight on risks, such as geopolitical developments or continued high inflation”,  which make it more likely that there could be a sharp correction in asset prices. Now, to be clear, the BoE isn’t pointing to the timing of the next market decline. However, the central bank is saying that some investor complacency may be creeping in. That got me thinking: which stock would I want to buy if we did see a decline? The pharma group on my watchlist As a reminder, a stock market correction is generally defined as a decline of at least 10% from a recent high. A  crash  is considered to be a drop of 20% or more. While that may be scary to some, I consider myself a long-term investor. That means I’m willing to look through some short-term uncertainty to pick up some high-quality stocks at bargain prices. The  FTSE 100  is up 8.5% since the start of the year but I still consider it a happy hunting ground. Over that same time, I’ve watched the  GSK  ( LSE: GSK ) share price climb only 1.5% to 1,500.5p. Despite lagging the broader index, I like the company’s fundamentals. With a  market capitalisation  of over £60bn and a 3.9% dividend yield, GSK ticks a lot of my boxes. One of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies, the GSK share price has been under pressure of late. Recent official guidance in the US narrowed the addressable market of its  Arexvy  vaccine. This, combined with ongoing lawsuits related to the its discontinued  Zantac  heartburn medication, hasn’t helped the share price. However, if we were to see a UK stock market correction, I’d like to invest in GSK. The company is an industry leader with significant research and development (R&D) activities that totalled £6.2bn in 2023. I believe that economies of scale can benefit GSK and drive long-term value during my long-term investment horizon. On top of that, demand for drugs tends to stay constant, regardless of the economic cycle. I like the industry’s defensive characteristics and GSK could provide a diversification benefit to my portfolio. With a  price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio  of 14, it’s fair to say GSK isn’t the cheapest stock out there right now. However, a broader market decline may well impact its valuation and I’ll be waiting on the sidelines to buy. Foolish takeaway I’m a fan of GSK’s business and the sector in which it operates, but there are risks that may impact my investment thesis. We’ve seen in recent weeks that regulatory hurdles can swing the potential sales of a new drug. The possible threat from lawsuits and failure rate of new products in the R&D pipeline can also impact on valuation.  However, I’m a believer in backing long-term leaders in their field. If we were to see a stock market correction, GSK is one   stock   I’d be looking to buy."},

But investors shouldn’t be afraid to look across the Atlantic in search of  stocks trading at bargain prices . After a 16% decline this year, the  McDonald’s  ( NYSE:MCD ) share price is near a 52-week low. I think the company’s shares now offer the same exceptional value as its burgers. A durable business McDonald’s offers its customers great value. And that resonates with consumers in pretty much any economic environment.  In general, the biggest threat with this type of business is  inflation . Whether it’s energy, staff, or raw materials, higher costs make it difficult to maintain low prices for consumers. This is a genuine challenge for McDonald’s and a risk with the stock. But the company has some advantages over its competitors when it comes to dealing with the threat of inflation. Unlike other restaurant franchises, the company owns its properties outright and leases them to tenants. This gives it a revenue stream that doesn’t depend on food sales.  As a result, McDonald’s can hold down food prices as costs rise in ways its rivals can’t. This is a big advantage and a key reason the business has proved durable. Outlook Stock market wisdom says that what teenagers are buying today is a good indication of what will be popular 10 or 20 years from now. If that’s right, things look good for McDonald’s. According to data from Piper Sandler, the company is the second-most popular food outlet for US teenagers. That’s a very positive sign looking forward – and it’s not the only one. McDonald’s operating margin 2014-24 Created at TradingView Over the last decade, McDonald’s has improved its operating margins and reduced its share count. This has been a powerful combination for growing earnings per share. McDonald’s shares outstanding 2014-24 Created at TradingView I expect the company to keep  repurchasing shares  with the cash it generates. And the ability to do this consistently should help growth in future. Valuation Despite all this, McDonald’s shares are cheap on a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis. The stock typically trades at a (P/E) ratio of 25, but the current multiple is closer to 21. McDonald’s P/E ratio 2014-24 Created at TradingView That’s unusually low for the company and I think it makes the case for buying the stock today quite a compelling one. It dramatically reduces the risk for investors.  For the McDonald’s share price to go down from here, one of two things needs to happen. The first is the stock trading at a lower P/E multiple and the second is earnings going down. Either is possible, but I don’t think either is likely. The fact the stock already at an unusually low P/E ratio means it would be historically surprising if it fell further from here.  Equally, the strength in the underlying business means it would be surprising if earnings per share declined. The share buyback programme also reduces the chance of this. US value The likes of  Microsoft  and  Nvidia  have been pulling the S&P 500 higher recently. But investors should be careful not to overlook US stocks that are unusually cheap right now. I think the case for buying McDonald’s shares at today’s prices is very strong. It’s impossible to eliminate risk entirely, but an unusually low P/E ratio goes a long way towards helping."},

Its share price has gone from £6.10 to £105.70 over that period. The company’s also been a terrific source of  dividends . And I think it could be a great passive income investment, even at today’s prices. Growth A decade ago, £10,000 would have bought me 1,639 shares in Games Workshop. This would have a market value of £173,242 today, which amounts to a 1,632% gain.  That’s a terrific result, but it’s important to note where that gain’s come from. It isn’t just investor sentiment – the rising share price has been driven by the underlying business. The stock currently trades at a  price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio  of 26, compared to 24 a decade ago. The share price increase isn’t the result of investors paying more for the same earnings. By contrast, Games Workshop’s earnings per share have grown from 25p to £4.09 over the last decade. That’s a 1,536% gain, which accounts for virtually all of the share price gain. Dividends Earnings growth has been outstanding. But the most impressive thing – in my view – has been its ability to do this while paying dividends to its shareholders.  A lot of businesses can grow their earnings. Often though, this involves investing in new products and facilities, which uses cash that could otherwise be returned to shareholders. With Games Workshop, the situation’s different. The company’s achieved its impressive earnings growth without having to reinvest the majority of its profits to fund this.  Since 2024, the company’s made £19.72 per share in profits and distributed £14.77 of that as dividends. If I’d used £10,000 to buy 1,639 shares a decade ago, I’d have received £24,208. Outlook Of course, there are risks with investing in the shares. The non-essential nature of its products creates a danger of lower profits when consumer spending’s weak. There’s no way to eliminate this risk entirely, but the company has some features that stand it in good stead for the long term. Chief among these is its low capital requirements.  Games Workshop’s ability to grow while distributing its cash is the result of its low capital requirements. And this is still a feature of the business, which bodes well for the future. The company owns the rights to  Warhammer . This means it doesn’t have to compete on price with other firms – it’s the only business able to manufacture products in that franchise. A stock to consider buying? Last year, Games Workshop distributed £4.09 in dividends per share. If I’d used £10,000 to buy 1,639 shares a decade ago, I’d have received £6,703 in passive income.  The big question is whether the stock’s still worth researching with a view to buying at today’s prices. I think it is. The business still has the key features that have driven its success over the last decade. Games Workshop still has a business model that allows it to grow while paying dividends to investors. And a P/E ratio of 26 means it’s not much more expensive than it was in 2014."},

By contrast, some stocks across the pond in America performed much better. For example,  Tesla ‘s ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) share price increased 13% over the same period. Here’s what drove the gains for the electric vehicle (EV) giant. Musk continues to be key Part of the boost for the stock’s come from a successful resolution of the charismatic Elon Musk’s compensation. Despite several months of dispute regarding historical pay and even lawsuits, shareholders voted overwhelmingly to approve his $48bn pay package. This was taken as an overall positive because it keeps Musk happy and also focused on driving Tesla forward. Few would say that Musk isn’t key in helping Tesla to grow, as he has been front and centre of it from the beginning. Another factor was the press coverage from a Tesla event in Austin, Texas. This relates to the moving of the firm there from a legal perspective, as well as the HQ. At the event, Musk spoke about Tesla’s future. He commented that it’s possible for Tesla to have a $30trn  market-cap  someday, given the growth potential. When I consider that the current market-cap is $630bn, there’s clearly scope for large share price gains if this comes to fruition. A broader market boost Aside from company specific factors, Tesla shares were caught up in the general positive vibes from the broader US stock market in June. The main indices, including the  Nasdaq 100  and the  S&P 500 , both finished the month higher. This good mood helped to lift a lot of stocks, with Tesla included. Let’s also not forget that Tesla is a member of the so called Magnificent 7. This means when investor sentiment’s high, this group in particular tend to do well. Short-term rally but still down For July, it looks like Tesla shares can continue to push higher. Yet even after the June run, the stock’s still down 24% over the past year. This speaks to one of the large risks, namely that some are concerned that demand for EV is slowing. Some believe that competitors are going to eat away at its market share, which would be a negative factor. Although we won’t get a clear answer on these points in July, it’s definitely something that  long-term investors  will be pondering. I don’t have a lot of free cash for growth stocks right now, but even if I did I think I’d prefer to allocate my money to other sectors right now, such as artificial intelligence (AI). That’s not to say I don’t think Tesla shares could do well, but I think there are better options out there at the moment."},

That said, it can often be difficult to know what companies to invest in. Dividends are never guaranteed. While double-digit yields can often be enticing, it’s important investors do their homework. The average yield on the Footsie comes in at just shy of 4%. While I tend to target companies that pay out a larger return than that, I’m more concerned about making sure that the companies I invest in can provide sustainable dividend payments moving forward. That’s why I like the look of these two stocks. I reckon there’s the argument to be made they’re up there with the best dividend shares on the index. If I had the cash today, I’d snap them up. British American Tobacco One stock I own is  British American Tobacco  ( LSE: BATS ). It hasn’t seen the greatest performance in the last five years. It has lost 10.9% of its value in that time. That said, it’s showing signs of momentum this year, rising 5%. It also yields a meaty 9.5%. That’s way above the Footsie average. What’s even more impressive is that the business has paid a dividend for over two decades, cementing itself as a  Dividend Aristocrat . That’s incredibly important to me. We saw just how many businesses cut their dividends during the pandemic and events such as the Global Financial Crash. A track record of returning to shareholders like the one British American has is worth its weight in gold. Now, I’m aware of the threats. Its core cigarettes business is declining in multiple markets. There are also regulatory risks. However, the business is seeing solid progress with its diversification into non-combustible goods. And its shares look like cracking value for money right now. They trade on a  price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio  of 6.5. Its forward P/E is 7.7. Diageo While the tobacco giant has started to gain some ground this year,  Diageo  ( LSE: DGE ), on the other hand, has been heading in the opposite direction. Year to date, the alcoholic beverage behemoth is down 11.7%. But just like British American Tobacco, I’m drawn in by its magnificent track record. Its current yield of 3.3% is just below the Footsie average. Nevertheless, Diageo has increased its payout for a whopping 37 years in a row and that’s a major lure. Considering the challenges the business has faced during that time, it’s impressive. Just as British American has been feeling the squeeze in its core markets, so has Diageo. Sales have wavered in the Latin America and Caribbean region while it has also experienced a slowdown in sales in the US. Its premium brands come at a price. Clearly, consumers have been reverting to cheaper alternatives. But this dip in price is an opportunity for shrewd investors like myself to consider snapping up the Dividend Aristocrat. In the decades to come, I think its dominant market position as well as trends such as rising wealth in developing nations will see it prosper."},

A FTSE 100 share and an ETF to consider in July!", "title_link": "https://www.fool.co.uk/2024/07/02/20k-to-invest-2-ftse-100-shares-and-an-etf-to-consider-in-july/", "published_date": "2 July, 2024", "publisher_name": "Royston Wild", "Description": "Building a balanced portfolio is essential for creating a strong and stable return over time. Investing in an exchange-traded fund (or ETF) can be a brilliant way for people to achieve this. Diversification reduces an investor’s exposure to the risk of any single asset performing poorly. It can also reduce a portfolio’s volatility across different points of the economic cycle. As an investor myself, I can achieve this by buying individual stocks. But I can also purchase an  ETF . This way, I can spread my cash over a greater number of shares (and other asset classes like bonds and commodities).  This strategy can also help me reduce trading costs. Purchasing an ETF involves just one transaction fee, while buying multiple shares involves several. A top FTSE stock I think a balanced approach of buying individual companies and ETFs is the right way to go. I can reduce risk, while also giving myself a chance to make market-beating returns by buying particular shares. If I had £20,000 to invest, I think  Coca-Cola HBC  ( LSE:CCH ) could be a great  FTSE 100  stock to consider this July. Thanks to in-demand brands like  Coke ,  Sprite  and  Fanta , the drinks bottler enjoys stable revenues at all points of the economic cycle. But the business is far from boring. It has excellent growth opportunities too, thanks to its vast exposure to Eastern European and African developing markets. I’m also encouraged by its successful move into fast-growing categories like energy drinks. Intense competition is a constant danger for fast-moving consumer goods like this. Yet City analysts still expect annual earnings to rise strongly over the next few years at least, beginning with a 26% jump in 2024. As a result, Coca-Cola HBC shares currently trade on a price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio of 0.6. At below 1, this indicates that a share is undervalued. Right now, I reckon it could be one of the  FTSE 100 ‘s best cheap shares to consider. … and a great ETF With a £20,000 investment, a good strategy could be to think about investing it equally in Coca-Cola HBC shares and an ETF. There are many funds to choose from today, but I think the  iShares Core S&P 500 ETF  ( LSE:CSPX ) may be one of the best. As the name implies, this fund gives me exposure to all of the businesses that make up the  S&P 500  index in the US. This has obvious benefits to anyone who focuses on UK shares and indices. It provides them with geographical diversification, as well as exposure to many different industries and companies. This helps me to balance risk while also offering the potential to make massive long-term returns. iShares ETF has provided an average annual return of 12.92% over the past decade. One potential drawback is the fund’s weighting of around 30% towards cyclical tech stocks. These could fall sharply in value if economic conditions worsen. Having said that, I still think that on balance this could be a great fund to think about holding today."},

In both cases, investors have been spooked by groundshaking strategy updates from the firms. But in the aftermath, there have been signs of strong dip-buying from retail investors. Legal & General is especially popular: today it’s in the top five of most-bought shares among both  Hargreaves Lansdown  and  AJ Bell  customers. I’m not surprised by this, to be honest. As the table below shows, both  FTSE 100  companies trade at a significant discount to the 12-month price targets of City analysts. Company Current share price 12 month share price target Discount Legal & General 227.5p 267.4p 16.8% National Grid 897p 1,104p 24.7% Of course there’s no guarantee that either stock will reach those average price targets. But I still believe both shares are worth serious consideration from value investors. Here’s why. Legal & General Legal & General shares plummeted chiefly because of the firm’s new plans to cool the pace of  dividend  growth. The business intends to grow 2024’s full-year dividend by 5%, as in recent years. But it intends to reduce annual growth to 2% between next year and 2027. Its reputation as a generous dividend payer is one of Legal & General’s unique selling points. So on one hand, I can understand why the market has given the news a big thumbs down. Still, I can’t help but feel that investors have overreacted here. Dividends haven’t been cut, after all. What’s more, the firm plans to balance out slower payout growth with share buybacks. It plans to kick this off with a £200m stock repurchase this year. The financial services giant looks in good shape to hit these targets too. With a Solvency II ratio of 224%, it has one of the greatest balance sheets in the sector. Investors now can get a 9.4%  dividend yield  for 2024 if they buy Legal & General shares. A sudden economic downturn could put pressure on that capital ratio, and in turn future dividends. But as things stand today, the firm looks in pretty good shape to me. National Grid Unlike Legal & General, power grid operator National Grid  will  reduce dividends per share in the near future. In May it announced plans to spend £60bn over the next five years to fund its green ambitions. This meant the issuance of £7bn worth of new shares, and the spread of the total dividend pot across a greater number of shares. I’m not shocked to see National Grid shareholders head for the exits. Its appeal as a reliable dividend stock has also been eroded by the decision to cut cash rewards. On top of this, company’s new strategy to build its asset base by 10% a year also comes with significant execution risk. But I also think the scale of the sell-off represents an attractive dip opportunity. As a long-term investor, I actually like the firm’s plans to better capitalise on the rapidly growing green economy.  This in turn could underpin strong dividend growth from this point on. Indeed, National Grid wants to start building annual dividends straight after the rebasement happens. It’s also important to note that National Grid shares still provide a healthy 5.4% dividend yield. If I had spare cash to invest I’d consider investing here for passive income."},

It has a  market cap  of £85m and a share price of 96p, making it a  penny stock . However, it has fast-growing revenues and is on the cusp of profitability. Moreover, it’s harnessing the revolutionary power of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in its products. Here’s why I’m invested and remain bullish. Wind-what? Windward is a software firm that uses AI to track ships and analyse data. Its platform is powered by machine learning models that utilise billions of data points to help companies and organisations understand risks, optimise routes, and ensure efficient transportation of goods by sea. While the stock is up 75% over the past year, it’s still down 52% since listing in late 2021. What I like here is that the firm’s marine tracking technology is in high demand (and likely to remain so) due to the increasing number of sanctions placed on regimes and vessels. Also, there’s ongoing chaos in the Red Sea where pirates — remember them? — have been making a comeback. Here are some firms and organisations that need to track ocean freight, especially with rising risks on the high seas:  \n Shipping companies track fleets and optimise routes for safety and efficiency \n\n\n\n Cargo owners and freight forwarders track shipments in real time to ensure timely delivery \n\n\n\n Insurers can use Windward’s data to assess maritime risk and set appropriate insurance premiums  \n\n\n\n Government agencies monitor suspicious activity and ensure regulatory compliance  \n Big-name customers  The company has a growing blue-chip customer base that includes  BP ,  Shell ,   and  HSBC . Its non-executive chairman is Lord John Browne, former CEO of BP. It also has a contract with the US Department of Homeland Security. And in February, the firm was chosen by INTERPOL, the world’s largest international police organisation. Blue-chip names like this give credibility to the firm’s platform. Just as importantly, it offers the opportunity to sell additional modules and services to these well-financed customers over time. Charting a course to profitability  The company’s software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, involving annual subscription for customers, means that nearly all its revenue is recurring. By the end of 2023, its annual contract value had increased 35% year on year to $34.5m. Revenue rose 31% to $28.3m while gross margin expanded from 72% to 79%.  The main risk is that the business is still loss-making. Last year’s  EBITDA  loss was $5m, down from $12.1m in 2022. However, it’s worth highlighting that the loss narrowed to just $1.2m in H2 of last year.  This suggests that the firm is well on course to reach EBITDA break-even this year, with profits likely to follow given its high gross margins and low capital requirements. It ended 2023 with net cash of $17.3m. Higher price ahoy? The City currently sees revenue rising to $35.1m this year then $41.2m in 2025. So growth looks nice and strong here, if forecasts are correct. As a small firm, Windward only has three analyst teams covering it. But they all have a ‘strong buy’ rating on the stock and a consensus one-year price target of 143p. Though just a target and not guaranteed, it’s still 49% higher than today’s price.  Finally, the up-and-coming stock is trading at 3.8 times sales, so doesn’t appear overvalued to me. I’d consider buying shares with spare cash in July."},

Stephen Wright looks at two growth stocks that fit the bill. When it comes to growth stocks, the headlines have been taken by big US tech firms. And rightly so – the likes of  Nvidia  and  Microsoft  have achieved spectacular results recently. It’s not just companies in the artificial intelligence race that have strong growth prospects, though. I think there are some interesting opportunities elsewhere at the moment. Rightmove Rising interest rates have been a real dampener for the  Rightmove  ( LSE:RMV ) share price. Despite a 25% increase in sales, the stock is still roughly where it was five years ago.  The main reason is that interest rates have gone from below 1% in 2019 to above 5% recently. That’s made borrowing more expensive and caused demand in the property market to slow. The biggest risk for Rightmove is the possibility of this continuing.  Inflation  reached the official 2% target last month, but the Bank of England seems reluctant to bring rates down. There are some positive signs, though. Lenders have been finding ways to offer mortgages with lower deposit requirements, causing house prices to hold up well. In addition, both the Conservatives and Labour are promising to invest in housing after the election. This should mean strong demand for the UK’s largest online property platform. Rightmove’s share price has struggled recently in an environment where interest rates have been higher. But now might be the time to consider buying the stock for what comes next. Broadridge Financial US-listed  Broadridge Financial Solutions  ( NYSE:BR ) probably isn’t on the radar of many UK investors. But I think it’s a really interesting stock that could be a great investment. The business distributes investor materials to shareholders for other companies. This is something they could do themselves, but it’s time-consuming and expensive. Broadridge’s scale means it can do this at a fraction of the cost. With the need for investor communications unlikely to go away, it has a dominant position in an important industry. That’s a powerful combination. However, despite the stock being down since the start of the year,  a  price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio  of 33 means there’s a clear risk for investors. The company’s competitive position gives it good scope for growth, though. The most conservative analyst estimates expect earnings per share to reach $9.20 by 2026. If that happens, the current share price implies a P/E ratio of around 21. Based on this, I think the stock looks like one to consider for investors looking for long-term returns. Long-term investing The best time to buy stocks is often when investors are looking the other way. And I think this is the case with Rightmove and Broadridge at the moment. With Rightmove, lower interest rates are the key to future growth. This should benefit both the share price and the underlying business.  In the case of Broadridge, the business is less cyclical. Its dominant position should allow it to grow its earnings through gradual price increases, sending the stock higher as a result."},

At 55.9p per share, the  FTSE 100   bank is now 17% more expensive than it was on New Year’s Day. By comparison, the broader Footsie has risen a more modest 6%. But I’m not tempted to buy the bank today. I actually believe that a sharp share price correction could be coming down the line. Here are three reasons why I think the Lloyds share price could crash. Soaring impairments The economic outlook for the UK in the short-to-medium term remains bleak. Major economic bodies expect GDP to expand around 1% over the next couple of years. Structural issues like high public debt, trade barriers, and labour shortages mean growth could remain weak beyond the near term, too. Cyclical shares like Lloyds will likely struggle to grow  revenues  in this climate. But this is not the only  danger. Tough economic conditions mean credit impairments could also keep swelling, even if interest rates fall.  On the plus side, Lloyds’ bad loans dropped to £70m in quarter one from £246m a year earlier. Yet the bank isn’t out of the woods. And its huge exposure to the mortgage market in particular means the number could suddenly surge again. This is because mortgage rates will rise for 3m households between now and 2026, according to the Bank of England (BoE). Of this number, 400,000 will be paying 50% more than they currently do, the bank says. As I say, Lloyds is especially immune to this threat. It provides around a fifth of all home loans in the UK. Margins mashed Lloyds’ chance to grow earnings will be made all the more difficult should — as the market expects — interest rates likely begin declining from late summer/early autumn. Banks make the lion’s share of their profits by setting loan interest at a higher rate than what they offer to savers. This is known as the net interest margin (NIM), and it is hugely sensitive to the BoE’s lending benchmark. Lloyds’ margins are falling even before the BoE has started cutting rates. In quarter one, its NIM fell 27 basis points to 2.95%. And so net interest income slumped 12%, to £3.1bn. Ambitious rivals Margin declines could be even more severe going forwards, and not just because of interest rate cuts. Growing competition from digital and challenger banks is also heaping pressure on the NIMs of established banks. Thankfully for Lloyds, it has exceptional brand strength and a large (if declining) presence on the high street. It therefore stands a better chance of maintaining and growing its customer base than many other banks. However, the threat from new entrants is still severe. And the landscape could get even more difficult if, as expected, they boost their financial firepower by floating shares. Monzo, Revolut, and Oaknorth are all tipped to launch IPOs sooner rather than later. Here’s what I’m doing On paper, Lloyds shares still look cheap despite recent gains. They trade on a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 8.6 times. However, I think the risks of owning the bank outweigh the potential benefits. So I’m buying other low-cost FTSE 100 shares right now."},

Recent Q1 earnings results revealed a 208% increase in operating cash flow and 93% increase in adjusted EBITDA. However, revenue growth was weak at only 9% and although net income improved, it still came in at a $8m loss. Overall, CEO Thomas Warsop said the results  “exceeded expectations .” It still carries a high level of debt ($1.03bn), with a debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio of 82.3%. That’s a risk if it increases but with earnings forecast to grow, I don’t expect that to happen. In the long term, I think the company has the potential to become a major player in the digital payments arena. Mark David Hartley owns shares in ACI Worldwide. Alphabet What it does: Alphabet is one of the world’s most famous big tech companies, now invested heavily in AI. By  Oliver Rodzianko . In my opinion,  Alphabet  ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) is one of the best investments on the US stock market right now. As such, it’s currently the second-largest holding in my portfolio. It is incredibly rare for a big tech company to be trading below what it’s worth based on future earnings and cash flow generation. However, in this instance, I think the shares are roughly 10% undervalued based on my advanced models. To understand the opportunity here more concretely, I compared the investment to  Microsoft , which has a price-to-earnings ratio of around 38. Alphabet’s ratio is just 27. Both are big competitors in the AI arms race. Therefore, Alphabet needs to be careful that Microsoft-backed ChatGPT doesn’t outdo Google’s Gemini. However, I’m betting Alphabet will continue to be an AI leader over the long term. That’s why I’ll be doubling down on my investment in the company again soon. Oliver Rodzianko owns shares in Alphabet. Shopify What it does: Shopify is a cloud-based e-commerce platform powering millions of online stores worldwide. By  Zaven Boyrazian .  Shopify  ( NYSE:SHOP ) has evolved drastically over the last decade. What started out as a simple e-commerce website builder has evolved into a full-stack business ecosystem. The platform handles online checkout, customer analytics, marketing, payment processing, business financing, and even logistics. As a result, merchants using the Shopify platform are now responsible for approximately 10% of all online transactions in the US. And despite what the volatile share price might suggest, the company is still growing at a double-digit pace, consistently beating analyst expectations. Not to mention that profit and free cash flow margins are also expanding. The stock does trade at a lofty multiple. So, seeing volatility in the share price isn’t a major surprise. Nor is it the only risk investors have to consider. Worsening economic conditions have created hurdles in the short term. And the firm still has plenty of rivals to compete with like  Amazon . Yet, with explosive long-term potential, these risks may be worth taking, in my opinion. Zaven Boyrazian owns shares in Shopify. Super Micro Computer What it does: The company provides computer hardware such as servers optimised for AI workloads.   By  Dr James Fox .  Super Micro Computer  ( NASDAQ:SMCI ) stock is up 1,000% over 18 months, but that doesn’t mean it’s overvalued.  The company, which makes hardware solutions, is one of the beneficiaries of the AI revolution. More than 50% of the company’s revenues now come from AI and data centres.  Super Micro’s innovation and first-to-market approach have seen its share of this lucrative and fast-growing market surge, reaching 8.4% in the last quarter.  While there may be bigger players in the segment, Super Micro’s open architecture and proprietary liquid cooling systems optimise server performance, and this is vital for demanding AI workloads.  One concern, as suggested by a handful of analysts, is that hyperscalers are frontloading their CAPEX on data centres and AI, inferring that the current demand is just a spike.  However, I do subscribe to that forecast. The consensus suggests that earnings will continue to grow by around 40% annually throughout the medium term, leading to a price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio of 0.73.  James Fox owns shares in Super Micro Computer.  TransMedics Group What it does: TransMedics Group is a medical technology company that provides hospitals with its organ care system (OCS). By  Muhammad Cheema . If I had to put all my money into one stock it would be  TransMedics  ( NASDAQ:TMDX ). This is because of how transformative its OCS system has been in the organ transplantation process. It keeps organs fresh for longer and has started taking over the whole process from organ retrieval to transportation. Transplant centers can therefore focus on patient care. And the company’s results prove how successful it’s been. Quarterly revenue is growing insanely fast, recently rising by 133%. It also became profitable for the first time. In terms of risks, the company is yet to make a profit on an annual basis. Furthermore, as TransMedics puts more emphasis on the logistics of the process, some focus could be taken away from producing innovative medical technology. However, I only expect the company to keep growing as organ transplantation is a huge issue. Unfortunately, over 100,000 people in the US are currently waiting for a transplant. Ultimately, TransMedics’ process could help to bring this number now. Muhammad Cheema owns shares in TransMedics."},

This continues their trend of outperforming the mid-cap index over many years. While the high street baker also pays a dividend, the ordinary  yield  of 2.2% is below the FTSE 250 average (3.3%). However, the stock does tend to reward shareholders with special dividends too.  So, how much would I need to fork out to aim for £1,000 in passive income across the next two years? And would I buy more Greggs shares today? Let’s dig in.  Passive income  Brokers  currently forecast 68.2p per share for the current financial year and 75.5p per share for next year. If they turn out to be correct, it means I’d need 700 shares to aim for £1,000 in dividend income over this period. Based on today’s share price of 2,756p (£27.56), these would set me back around £19,292. That’s not chump change, at least not for me, meaning I’d personally rather spread such a sum around a handful of stocks.  However, Greggs also has a policy of returning surplus cash to shareholders in the form of special dividends. For FY23, it paid an extra 40p per share (received in May with the final dividend).   If it did so again in FY24 and FY25, that would raise the two-year payout from 700 shares to above £1,500.  This isn’t guaranteed though, especially as the firm is ramping up its capital expenditure to £250m-£280m this year (from £200m) to drive growth in the business. Ultimately, no payouts are set in stone. Peak Greggs? Last year, sales rose by almost 20% to £1.8bn while it delivered record profits of £188m (up 27%). And having recently reached 2,500 locations, it is now on track to expand its network to 3,000 shops. Some investors thought we’d have long reached ‘peak Greggs’ by 2024. However, the firm keeps finding ways to grow sales. Here are some: \n Opening for longer in the evening \n\n\n\n Driving increased loyalty through the app \n\n\n\n Delivering food on  Uber  Eats as well as  Just Eat \n\n\n\n Expanding partnerships with retailers including Primark,  Tesco , and  Sainsbury’s \n\n\n\n Increasing franchise partnerships, especially in forecourts \n In 2023, it even overtook  McDonald’s  to become the UK’s most popular breakfast destination. Skinny jabs  In the first 19 weeks of 2024, like-for-like sales growth was 7.4%. So the Greggs growth story rolls on.  However, one risk I’m keeping an eye on here is GLP-1 weight-loss drugs (nicknamed ‘skinny jabs’). These are known to work by reducing appetite and can lead to fewer cravings for snacks and  baked goods .  There are millions of overweight people in the UK that could end up on these drugs over the next few years. If management starts mentioning the dreaded ‘W’ words — ‘weight-loss drugs’ or specifically ‘ Wegovy ‘ ( Novo Nordisk ‘s blockbuster GLP-1 drug) — the stock could get hammered.  Speaking as a shareholder, I’m reassured that Greggs is already adapting by offering healthier menu options. For example, it recently won a healthy eating award for its sweet potato bhaji and rice salad bowl. The stock is trading at around 19 times forward earnings. I think that’s fair value, so I’d consider adding Greggs shares to my portfolio today if I didn’t already own them."},

High yields are more often than not a red flag, for me at least. However, it’s always worth noting that dividends are never guaranteed. With that in mind, two consistent stocks I reckon investors should be taking a closer look at are  Bunzl  ( LSE: BNZL ) and  Howden Joinery Group  ( LSE: HWDN ). Here’s why! What they do Bunzl is a business with roots stretching back over 100 years. Although it has changed over the years, the company now focuses on food package delivery and cleaning products. Howden is one of the UK’s largest kitchen manufacturing and joinery specialists with a wide presence across the country. It sells its products to trade customers, as well as direct to consumers through its many depot locations. Bunzl’s investment case Diving straight into the subject of returns, Bunzl currently offers a  dividend yield  of 2.3%. This is a great example of a yield that doesn’t get my pulse racing. However, what does excite me is the firm’s track record, as it has raised annual dividends for dividends. When it comes to passive income, safe and steady increases excite me more than sporadic payouts with high yields. However, it is worth mentioning that past performance is never a guarantee of the future. One of Bunzl’s biggest draws for me is its size, scale, and experience. With a presence in over 30 countries, and sticky relationships with the majority of its customers, it possesses defensive abilities, if you ask me. This is because the products it offers are essentials. This has allowed the business to generate steady earnings and reward shareholders for years. From a bearish view, Bunzl’s performance has been hurt in the past, and recently too, based on a trading report released last week, due to economic turbulence. Higher inflation and weaker consumer confidence has led to a drop in spending across its products. This is something I’d keep an eye on, as it could hurt potential returns in the future. Howden’s investment case The business has grown quietly into one of the largest suppliers of its kind over the years. This has allowed it to return cash to shareholders consistently. The shares currently offer a dividend yield of 2.3%. Like Bunzl, Howden has a good track record of payouts in recent years. It has increased its dividend per share for the past four years. Furthermore, before the pandemic, it was on an eight-year streak. In terms of looking forward, Howden has developed a stellar reputation in the trade, which has allowed it to grow earnings. Due to the current housing shortage in the UK, I reckon the business is primed to continue growing, which should in theory, boost earnings, and investor returns. The natural risk for Howden is being at the mercy of  inflation  linked to the vital raw materials it needs to manufacture its products. Higher costs could result in tighter margins and smaller dividends. However, with the current housing shortage mentioned, and popularity of its products and wide presence, this is not something I’m too concerned about."},

And right now there are some interesting opportunities in the stock market, especially in the UK. Over the last month or so, a few stocks have fallen significantly. But I think this makes them very attractive both in terms of growth and for investors looking for  dividend income . Admiral The  Admiral  ( LSE:ADM ) share price fell 4.5% in June. A price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23 reflects the fact this is a quality company, but I think investors are overlooking something. Last month, inflation reached the Bank of England’s 2% target. That looks like a good thing to me – less expensive repairs should help the company’s underwriting margins.  The risk is that it might cause a cut in interest rates. This could reduce the returns Admiral generates by investing the premiums it collects, lowering profits in this part of the business. On balance, though, I see the falling share price as an opportunity. The company’s real advantage is in its underwriting and I think lower inflation could enhance this strength. B&M European Value An 18% decline made  B&M European Value  ( LSE:BME ) the worst-performing  FTSE 100  stock during June. That’s sent the P/E ratio down to around 12, which I think is a bargain. Of course, there are risks. The main one is the company competes in an industry where switching costs are non-existent, meaning it has to compete constantly to keep prices down. B&M has some good advantages in this area, though. It imports directly from the Far East, keeps its range of products low, and focuses on branded goods to differentiate itself.  On top of this, it has big growth plans that should boost both earnings and dividends. I think taking advantage of a short-term weakness in the stock could be a great move. GSK Shares in  GSK  ( LSE:GSK ) fell around 12% in June. This was largely brought on by news that US regulators plan to restrict the use of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. This neatly illustrates one of the biggest risks with investing in this type of stock. Regulation is a key part of the pharmaceutical industry and there’s not much businesses can do about it. GSK does some important advantages that help it in this environment, though. Its size and scale allow it to invest heavily and distribute effectively, boosting its chances of success.  Overall, I think a  dividend yield closing in 4%  goes some way to offsetting the risks with the stock. That’s why I see the decline as an opportunity. Opportunistic investing Charlie Munger  used to say investing well is about making the most of opportunities when they present themselves. I think that’s the case with Admiral, B&M, and GSK right now. Each has had some negative news over the last month, but in each case the stock has fallen further than I believe it should have. That’s why they’re on my list of stocks to buy in July."},

However, I’m smart enough to understand the difference between value and price. Let me explain my approach to small caps, and give an example of a former penny stock currently on the  FTSE 100 . Things I look out for What does the business do, and how can it make money and grow? Is the business offering something entirely new to market? What is its unique selling point for its customers that could help grow earnings, and potentially provide shareholder value? The firm in question may be simply looking to change the game for an existing product or service. However, due to their smaller stature, small-cap companies often come across challenges. One of the biggest obstacles that small caps face is financial might. A small cap won’t have the same flexibility or strength on their balance sheet that a larger established firm generally has. This can often lead to financial troubles, and in many cases, they fail. Many of these firms borrow to fund growth, and this debt can often become a huge insurmountable burden. Finally, when a small cap comes along that is a potential money spinner, there’s always a chance that a larger firm in the same industry will offer to take it over, and buy it. This isn’t the worst-case scenario, as shareholders are often compensated handsomely as part of the deal. One former penny stock turned giant There is tangible evidence that penny stocks can turn into giants. A prime example is FTSE 100 incumbent  JD Sports  ( LSE: JD. ). The branded sportswear and footwear retailer hails from humble beginnings with a sole store in Bury back in the 1970s. Today, it is one of the largest firms of its kind with a worldwide presence and lucrative partnerships with giants including  Nike . Plus, it has expanded its business model, including a foray into the gym business. In the early 2000s, JD Sports shares were trading for 2p. At present, they trade for 120p, which is a 5,900% increase! This increase would have been higher if not for a drop in recent months. Over a 12-month period, the shares are down 17% from 146p at this time last year, to current levels. It’s worth noting that the firm has had its share of issues. Some of these include the current risks I’d need to take into account if I was looking to snap up some more shares today. The recent economic turbulence has resulted in poorer-than-expected sales, resulting in profit warnings. This is the reason why the shares have fallen in recent months. Consumers are more concerned with essential bills, rather than leisurewear. This is something I’ll keep an eye on. I’d still be willing to buy more JD Sports shares today if I could, as they look well-priced after the recent drop. They currently trade on a  price-to-earnings ratio  of 10. Plus, the shares offer a  dividend yield  of just under 1%, which could grow. However, I do understand that dividends are never guaranteed. There are many other examples that show penny stocks can contribute towards building huge wealth, including  4Imprint Group  and  Ashtead ."},

It’s down around 8% over the last month, representing one of the biggest pull backs since Putin’s war in Ukraine began. The stock’s up 152% over three years. The question is, has BAE Systems extended too high? Is this trickle going to become a flood of capital leaving? Close to its target price The average share price target for BAE Systems is £14.16. That’s base on 18 analysts and it suggests the  FTSE 100   stock’s actually trading at a 7.3% discount. Among the 18 analysts, seven recommend ‘buy,’ three target ‘outperform,’ seven say ‘hold,’ and one forecasts ‘underperform’. While this suggests some optimism, it’s actually quite rare for good UK companies to trade this close to their share price targets.  I’d also caution that analysts can be very wrong. I mostly trust the consensus, but some analysts from major institutions have poor records.  Not overly cheap I’m aware that many UK-focused investors would baulk at a stock trading at 20.6  times forward earnings . However, that shouldn’t be a concern if earnings are growing at the requisite rate.  The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio falls to 18.3 times in 2025 and 16.6 times in 2026, highlighting that analysts expect earnings to move in the right direction. However, in my opinion, these figures don’t suggest earnings are growing fast enough.  My calculations suggest that earnings are growing by around 10.5% annually, and this gives us a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio above two. Normally, a PEG ratio under or around one is a sign of a good value stock. So BAE’s looking a little expensive, especially on this medium-term metric. Even when factoring in the 2.3% dividend yield, it doesn’t make me want to buy the stock. It’s a long-term investment Near- and medium-term metrics are always useful, but it’s arguably less so for companies like BAE which work on multi-year, even decade-long, programmes like AUKUS. Instead, more emphasis should be placed on new long-term indicators such as new contracts, project milestones, technological advancements, and strategic alignment. BAE Systems is poised to secure several significant new contracts in 2024. Potential contracts include additional work on the AUKUS programme, the UK’s Tempest future combat air system, and upgrades for the US Air Force’s intercontinental ballistic missiles. Of course, there’s a host of smaller and less high-profile projects that may even be more lucrative for BAE.  Moreover, within the current geopolitical context — warring Russia, assertive China, and a hot Middle East — governments around the world are committing to increased defence budgets and new long-term programmes.  This is the ideal scenario for BAE.  The bottom line Analysts suggest there’s not much room for the share price to grow, and the metrics support that. However, there are long-term drivers at play here. It’s not just about the next three years.  My hunch is that BAE’s priced fairly at the moment. Nonetheless, geopolitical developments will continue to dictate share price near-term movements. I’m not expecting the stock to collapse."},

I just didn’t get around to it, and I missed what turned out to be a golden opportunity. These things happen to  investors , and I’m happy to take the rough with the smooth. However, with the stock at a one-year high, it’s time to re-evaluate BT as an investment opportunity.  Mexican backing According to a stock market filing on 12 June, Mexican magnate Carlos Slim — once the richest man in the world — has taken a 3.16% stake in the  FTSE 100  stock.  Slim, whose family controls telecommunications giant  América Móvil , bought around £408m of BT stock, noting the share price at the time of the filing. Shares in the company had already risen 10% in May after CEO Allison Kirkby set out her long-term vision for the company.  The stock rose around 10% again in the days following Slim’s purchase. Several analysts suggested it was a vote of confidence in the UK.  Is BT still undervalued? According to the 18 analysts covering the stock, BT’s vastly undervalued. There are currently 14 Buy or Outperform ratings, two Hold ratings, and two Sell or Underperform ratings. This would suggest that the consensus is a Strong Buy’ The average share price target compounds this. According to the 18 analysts, the average share price is £1.92 per share. That’s a whopping 37.4% above the current price. Things are looking up In recent years, the big issue facing BT’s share price has been simply a lack of clarity on future performance. The company has been investing billions in fibre-to-the-premise (FTTP) and this is hugely expensive. In fact, it costs around £85m to roll out FTTP to 100,000 households. The rollout has also demanded BT bring on more and more staff. It’s a major investment that has been pressure on earnings. And many analysts wondered if BT could ever afford to repay these mammoth costs. Don’t get me wrong, this still remains an issue. BT has a huge amount of debt and is in a relatively precarious position that could leave it vulnerable to disruptive technologies.   However, Kirkby’s vision for the company has helped develop a sense of optimism. The new CEO plans to cut costs by £3bn every year until the end of the decade, reducing pressure on the company’s debt burden and improving margins. We also understand that BT has reached peak capital expenditure for its FTTP rollout and, moving forward, staff numbers should fall and costs with it. Moreover, FTTP is much simpler to operate. Traditional copper wiring degrades and breaks over time, and the fibre shift will mean a much smaller and cheaper maintenance workforce. I don’t think I’ve missed my opportunity to buy BT shares. However, there are several stocks on my radar with potentially stronger value propositions."},
{"source_name": "The Motley Fool", "title": "A 9.9% dividend yield! Is this hidden FTSE passive income gem too good to miss?", "title_link": "https://www.fool.co.uk/2024/07/02/a-9-9-dividend-yield-is-this-hidden-ftse-passive-income-gem-too-good-to-miss/", "published_date": "2 July, 2024", "publisher_name": "Simon Watkins", "Description": "In 2023,  FTSE  firm  Phoenix Group Holdings  ( LSE: PHNX ) paid a total dividend of 52.65p. On the current share price of £5.31, this gives a  yield  of 9.9%. This is more than double the present  FTSE 100  average yield of 3.6% and triple the  FTSE 250 ’s 3.3%. The high payout is not a fluke, as it has been paying increasingly large dividends over the past few years. Working back four years from 2022, it paid 50.8p, 48.9p, 47.5p, and 46.8p. These provided respective yields at the time of 8.3%, 7.4%, 6.8%, and 6.2%. Analysts’ forecasts are for these payouts to continue to rise. For 2024, projections are for 53.3p, with 54p expected in 2025, and 55.7p in 2026. These dividends would yield 10%, 10.2%, and 10.5% on the current share price. Can the high dividends be maintained? In its 2023 results report, CEO Andy Briggs said £1.4bn in expected operating cash generation by end-2026 will  “more than cover a growing dividend” . He added that the excess cash will be used to support further investment into the business and/or additional shareholder rewards. It certainly looks in a great position to do this, in my view. The company operates some of the biggest brands in the UK’s insurance business, including Standard Life. It is also its largest long-term savings and retirement business, with £283bn of assets under administration and 12 million customers. A risk in the stock is a resurgence in the cost-of-living crisis that may prompt customers to cancel policies. Another is poor hedging of its capital position, as has occurred before. This hedging involves trading other assets with the intention of reducing the risk of adverse market movements on its capital. However, consensus analysts’ expectations are for earnings to grow 38.9% a year to the end of 2026. Earnings per share are forecast to increase by 52.5% a year to that point. Big passive income returns I like to think of passive income as money made even while I sleep, with shares being a prime example. Money can be made when they rise in price and/or when they pay dividends. So £10,000 for example invested in Phoenix Group shares yielding 9.9% would make me £990 in the first year. If that money was taken out of the investment account and spent, I would make another £990 the following year. After 10 years of doing this at an average yield of 9.9%, I would have made an extra £9,900. Crucially though, if I bought more Phoenix Group shares with the dividends then I would make much more. This is known as ‘dividend  compounding ’. Doing this would make me an additional £14,514 after 10 years instead of £9,900, on an average 9.9% yield. So, my investment pot would be worth £24,514, and pay £2,427 a year in dividends, or £202 a month. After 30 years on the same basis, it would be worth £147,306, paying me £14,583 a year, or £1,215 each month! None of that is guaranteed, of course, and I could lose out in terms of share price falls and any cuts to the dividend. But given the high growth prospects and terrific yield, the shares looked too good to miss when I first bought them. Nothing has changed for me, so I will be adding to my holding shortly."},

It allows me more choice in the work I do, the holidays I take, and the opportunities I can give my family. In short, it gives me much greater freedom in life than having to sit in an office all day trying to earn a crust. Many people seem to think that generating passive income requires a lot of money upfront, but this is not the case. Small amounts invested regularly in high-quality shares that pay high dividends can make big passive income over time. A case in point I recently bought more shares in  FTSE 100  firm  M&G  ( LSE: MNG ), so will use this as an example. Last year it paid 19.7p a share in dividends. On the current price of £2.04, this gives a  yield  of 9.7% — dwarfing the FTSE 100’s 3.6% average. As great as this payout is, analysts predict that it will go even higher. Consensus forecasts are for annual dividend payments of 20p, 20.7p and 21.3p, respectively, in 2024, 2025, and 2026. On the current share price, this would give respective yields of 9.8%, 10.2%, and 10.5% in those years. £5 a day to make major returns Even with no savings in the bank, just £5 a day (£150 a month) invested at 9.7% can make a big passive income. In the first year, the return would be £175 only, but this is just the start of the process. To maximise the money-making potential of every penny invested, a method called ‘dividend compounding’ can be used. This means that all dividends paid are used to buy more of the stock, which in turn creates more dividends. Simply by doing this, the total investment pot would be worth £30,448 after 10 years, given an average 9.7% yield. This would pay £2,953 a year in passive income, or £246 every month. On the same proviso, the pot would be valued at £320,695 after 30 years. This would pay £31,107 a year in dividends, or £2,592 monthly! How does the business look? A company’s dividend is powered by earnings and profits over time. If these rise, there is every chance dividends will too. There are risks as well in all companies’ outlooks, and the same applies to M&G. The principal one in my view is that it has a debt-to-equity ratio of around 1.9.  This is higher than the 1.5 top end of the range considered good for many companies, depending on the industry. Although several investment firms use debt to finance growth, I would like to see this come down.  However, the firm made an adjusted  operating profit  of £797m in 2023 – a rise of 28% from 2022. Operating capital generation also increased sharply — by 21%, to £996m. Consensus analysts’ forecasts are for M&G’s earnings to grow at 18.8% a year to the end of 2026. Earnings per share are expected to increase by 18.2% a year to that point. Given its huge passive income potential and growth prospects, I will be buying more of the stock soon."},

I think so, and here’s one to consider buying in July", "title_link": "https://www.fool.co.uk/2024/07/02/are-ftse-100-shares-still-cheap-i-think-so-and-heres-one-to-consider-buying-in-july/", "published_date": "2 July, 2024", "publisher_name": "Mark David Hartley", "Description": "Economic instability has been a defining factor of the 2020s but the  FTSE 100  has done well to escape its wrath. Adding 442 points this year, it recently hit an all-time high above 8,400. But does that mean the index is now packed full of overbought shares? I don’t think so.  The lingering effects of Covid have left many otherwise  valuable shares  lagging behind their earnings. Many companies that performed spectacularly well in the first two decades of this century still struggle to regain the highs of 2020.  But with interest rates primed to fall and the global economy recovering, some of these businesses could be back on track soon. With that in mind, here’s a stock I think’s perfectly positioned to reap the rewards of a revitalised economy. Diageo As one of the world’s largest distributors of premium alcohol brands,  Diageo  ( LSE: DGE ) relies rather heavily on consumers with disposable cash. The London-based firm markets everything from high-end Scottish whisky to mainstream brands like  Smirnoff  and  Guinness . But recently, sales have suffered as consumers seek out lower-priced alternatives. The share price has been in decline since late 2022, falling from around £40 to £25 today. Diageo has attributed the loss mainly to falling rum sales in the Caribbean and Latin America, likely a result of post-pandemic economic tightening. It’s now only a few percentage points away from hitting a new five-year low, with £24.20 being the lowest it fell after Covid. I think this is a key price point that could attract investment. Coupled with an improving economy makes it an attractive prospect.  But it’s not in the clear yet I think Diageo has all the makings of a company that could (and should) be doing well. But there are some concerns. The upcoming UK general election could flip things on their head if it delivers a surprise result. Even if it doesn’t, it’s hard to gauge the resultant economic effects. Some analysts expect it won’t make much difference. Others believe an unconvincing win or a coalition government could cause further disruption. Alcohol may also be falling out of favour among younger generations. Statistics reveal that changes in social behaviour mean younger people aren’t drinking as much as their parents. While this is likely a net positive for society, Diageo will need to consider pivoting into non-alcoholic brands if it hopes to pick up the slack.   The decline in earnings has forced it to rack up debt, now at a precipitous £17.15bn. With only £8.85bn in shareholder equity, that’s not an ideal amount. But with earnings expected to grow from here, analysts forecast a 39% increase in  return on equity (ROE)  over the next three years. That should help alleviate some debt if the economic recovery doesn’t falter. A turning point The combination of the UK election, the current price level and the promise of an improving economy put Diageo at a turning point. The current price looks undervalued to me but this month should provide a better idea of where it’s headed.  I’m expecting a recovery and will be ready to buy more shares if that happens."},

Just after the halfway point, the index is up 5.7% but down from highs reached earlier in the year. Interestingly, while the FTSE 100 did reach record highs above 8,400 in May, many analysts have been keen to point out that, by several metrics, the index remains depressed.  In fact, in dollar and euro terms, the index didn’t reach an all-time high in 2024. By both these metrics, the FTSE 100 peaked in the 2000s when the pound was stronger.  Moreover, using inflation-adjusted metrics, among others, it’s clear that the index isn’t actually storming ahead.  With this is mind, it might come as something of a surprise to hear that the Bank of England (BoE) recently suggested that asset prices were looking at little stretched.  What did the Bank of England say? In its financial stability report on 27 June, the BoE said that the prices of many assets, including shares and bonds, were elevated versus historical norms. The Bank added that some are continuing to rise.  “This suggests that investors in financial markets are continuing to expect the economy to recover and inflation to fall. They are placing less weight on risks, such as geopolitical developments or continued high inflation, that might cause weaker growth or interest rates to stay higher than expected.”  It concluded:  “These risks make it more likely that there could be a sharp correction in asset prices.”   The BoE added that a sharp correct in asset prices could make it more challenging for Britons to borrow. So what does this mean? Well, personally, it’s not stopping me from investing. And while I’ve been increasingly focused on US investments over the past 12 months, I disagree with the premise that UK stocks, as a whole, are overvalued. One under-appreciated FTSE 100 stock While I often think there are better investment opportunities on the US market, one FTSE 100 stock I’m looking to buy more of is joint replacement specialist  Smith & Nephew  ( LSE:SN. ). The stock underperformed during the pandemic when medical funds were directed to the treatment of Covid and away from elective surgeries.  Its disappointing trajectory was compounded by the release of highly-effective weight losses drugs like  Wegovy . Some analysts suggest that thinner populations will mean less demand for hip replacements. While this remains a concern in my eyes, the company says they don’t expect any material impact. Smith & Nephew’s earnings haven’t impressed investors since the pandemic, but the forecasts are very strong. The stock’s currently trading at 19.5  times forward earnings , and this is expected to fall to 14.7 times in 2025 and 12.5 times in 2026 as earnings improve. While this may still appear expensive for some investors, I’d suggest it’s undervalued, considering the growth trajectory and sector."},

That’s what analysts are saying with their £2.30 price target, which reflects a 41.7% premium to the current share price.  This is one of the biggest valuation gaps I’ve come across on the  FTSE 100  in recent months. And while analysts can be wrong, it’s important to remember this is the consensus opinion of all 15 analysts covering the stock. The stock currently has 11 Buy or Outperform ratings and just four Holds. No analysts have rated this airline operator as a Sell. Don’t take their word for it As I mentioned, analysts from major financial institutions can be way off in their predictions. And while I do put a good amount of faith in the consensus, it’s always worthwhile following up by undertaking your own analysis. So are IAG shares undervalued? Well, starting with the similar metrics, IAG trades with a  price-to-earnings  (P/E) ratio of just 4.35 times. I know that’s enough to catch the eye of most UK investors, but let’s dive further. It’s worth noting that there’s little point investing in company with a low P/E if it doesn’t pay a dividend or if its earnings are going backwards. Thankfully, IAG’s earnings are growing.  The P/E ratio is set to fall to 3.93 times in 2025 and 3.73 times in 2026. Moreover, we could see the return of a meaningful dividend in the medium term, thus improving the overall returns of the stock.  The P/E ratio’s a little basic. It doesn’t take into account debt. While several of IAG’s peers are debt free, IAG has €7.4bn of debt, and this needs to be taken into account. IAG’s EV-to-EBITDA ratio — which takes debt into account — is 3.11 times for 2024, 2.82 times for 2025, and 2.58 times for 2026. This puts it pretty much in line with debt-free peer  easyJet , and much cheaper than other peers. One word of caution. The aviation industry’s been hit by multiple shocks in recent years — the pandemic, Russia-related fuel price spikes — and I believe this is still weighing on the share price. Geopolitics is always a factor when fuel’s involved. As fuel represents 25% of IAG’s costs, rising prices would represent a risk to the business. Considerations for the industry One reason I like easyJet at the moment is because it offers total shelter from  Boeing . For those readers that haven’t been following, Boeing has had some high-profile safety incidents in 2024, compounding concerns about airworthiness following the MCAS failures that led to two deadly crashes. IAG does have a handful of Boeing 777-200 and 777-300, as well as the 787-8, however the majority of the fleet are  Airbus  aircraft. This puts both IAG and easyJet in my good books. While easyJet also currently looks like a good option, my preference remains for IAG. While easyJet’s market’s more focused on low-cost and tourism, IAG’s more diverse in its operations. IAG, the parent company of British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus, and Vueling, operates across multiple segments, including both premium and budget travel.  This diversity represents a more robust business model that can weather market fluctuations more effectively. I’m considering the stock and feel that other investors should do so too."},

Back in 2021, they were trading near 2,900p. Today (2 July) however, they are around 90% lower at 290p. Is this an amazing opportunity to buy the shares for my portfolio? Or is this a risky stock to avoid? Let’s discuss. Why the share price has tanked Let’s start with a look at why the share price has crashed. The thing to understand about Ocado is that it’s not just a grocery delivery business. Alongside its retail joint venture with  M&S , it also offers end-to-end technology solutions that help other supermarkets move their operations online. I’ve always thought Ocado’s technology solutions division has a lot of potential. After all, the world is only going to become more digital in the years ahead. The problem is, this division’s losing money hand over fist at the moment. This year, Ocado is expected to generate a net loss of £335m. That’s after a net loss of £314m last year. In a high-interest-rate environment, these losses have really hurt the stock. Investors just don’t have the patience to wait for profits anymore. Recent news that Canadian supermarket Sobeys has put a new warehouse in Vancouver on hold hasn’t helped. This led to a number of brokers cutting their price targets ( Morgan Stanley  lowered its target to 215p from 345p), which also put pressure on the share price. Should I buy now? Taking a  long-term  view, I continue to believe that Ocado has potential from an investment perspective. However, I’m not in a rush to buy the stock today. While the company’s revenues continue to rise (analysts  expect  top-line growth of about 8% this year), the big losses are a turn-off for me. I’d like to see some evidence that profits are on the cards in the near future. With no earnings, it’s hard to accurately value the company. The nasty share price downtrend is a turn-off too. Where it ends is anyone’s guess. One thing I’ve learnt over the years is that trends can stay in place for a while and trying to fight them can backfire. Note that if Morgan Stanley’s analysts are right, there could be another 25% to fall. One other issue here is that the company’s currently engaged in a spat with M&S on the retail side of its business. M&S says it shouldn’t have to make a final payment of £191m to Ocado because the online grocery company’s performance has been poor. Overall, the company – and the stock – are a bit of a mess right now. So I won’t be buying any shares in the near term. Why take the risk on Ocado when there are so many other shares that are performing really well (and making long-term investors like myself money) in the current bull market?"},

I don’t own a massive property portfolio. I also don’t have a side hustle focusing on a cutting edge industry such as the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. Instead, I invest my money in the stock market and buy  FTSE 100  companies with  meaty dividend yields  that can pay me a handsome second income. Let’s say I had £20,000 in savings. Here’s how I’d go about targeting an income of over £2,700 a month. The method I’d get the ball rolling by opening a  Stocks and Shares ISA  account. It’s a great way for investors to boost their returns. That’s because the ISA acts as a tax wrapper. Any capital gains I made or dividend payments I received wouldn’t be taxed.

It is not intended to be, neither does it constitute, any form of tax advice. Readers are responsible for carrying out their own due diligence and for obtaining professional advice before making any investment decisions. I’d then target five to 10 companies in the Footsie offering above average (3.6%) yields. I could lump all my money into one company, but  that’s not sustainable . Instead, I like to target a variety of companies with proven business models and large customer bases. One share I like An example of the above is asset manager  M&G  ( LSE: MNG ). It’s a stock I like and if I had the cash today I’d buy some shares. There are a few reasons why. The asset management industry’s massive, and M&G has a large presence in the sector with millions of customers across numerous markets. What’s more, its dividend yield is 9.6%. Since going public in 2019, its payout has increased every year. Management has said it aims to try and continue this trend. There are risks. A weak economy is one. Its assets under management could take a hit should investors decide to pull their money from funds. That’s especially a threat during a cost-of-living crisis. But M&G shares look dirt cheap trading on nine times forward earnings. As far as Footsie shares go, I think it’s a stock that investors should consider taking a closer look at. The target So how could my £20,000 in savings turn into a healthy stream of passive income? Well, applying M&G’s 9.6% yield, I’d earn £1,920 a year on my £20,000. Don’t get me wrong, that would most certainly come in handy. But with the aim of funding my retirement with the income I make, I plan to generate more than that. That’s why I’d reinvest my dividends along the way to benefit from  compounding . This essentially means I’d earn interest on my interest. By doing so, after 30 years, I’d make £32,119 a year in passive income. That works out to £2,766 a month. That’s more like it. With an income like that, I could live a much more lavish lifestyle after giving up work. It must be noted that a near-10% return a year isn’t guaranteed. The market’s volatile. And while I’m optimistic we could see M&G’s payout keep rising, there’s the potential that it falls. However, what this proves is that playing the long game pays off. I’m biding my time in the market as I continue to take steps closer to my financial goals. And as part of a diversified portfolio, it’s stocks like M&G I’d look to help get me there."},

Yet if that money is surplus to my needs and isn’t generating any form of return, I need to do something about it. That’s why I prefer to invest my savings in ideas that can make me good levels of passive income. One example is putting money to work via  the stock market . Things to do (and avoid) The general principle of making income via the stock market comes from utilising  dividend stocks . These are shares that pay out dividends to shareholders, usually a couple of times a year. So if I can have a portfolio of around a dozen stocks, I should be receiving some form of income every month. The big question revolves around which dividend stocks to buy. After all, there are hundreds of different ideas to choose from. Even within the  FTSE 100 , the range on the dividend yields goes from 0% to above 10%. I like to target the upper range with yields around 6-8%. This is because it’s higher than the current base rate of 5.25%. Also, there’s a good mix of companies that have a yield in this range. When I start to look at the 10%+ area, there are only a few stocks that meet this criteria.  Further, the higher the yield, the more risky it becomes. In some cases, the yield’s only this high because the share price has been falling rapidly. This isn’t sustainable for the long term, so I prefer to give that a pass. A good inclusion As a good example of a stock I own, consider  Rio Tinto  ( LSE:RIO ). I bought the mining stock early in the year thinking that it gives me good exposure to commodities. After all, I believe several key commodities could do well going forward. This includes copper, which Rio Tinto mines for. There’s a huge commercial need for copper, which contributes to the electric vehicle (EV) motors and batteries. Another angle is iron ore, which Rio Tinto is a leader in producing. This is used in steel and so is sold to places like China that is a manufacturing powerhouse. The business is doing well, with the stock up 4% over the past year. The dividend yield is 6.62%, so in the target yield bucket I want. From looking at the finances from the past few years, Rio Tinto has always been clearly profitable. Therefore I don’t see a risk that it falls to a loss and has to completely stop paying out a dividend. One risk is that lower demand from China could be seen as their economic recovery continues to be shaky. This would negatively impact iron ore sales. Making the cash If I took my £10k in savings and invested it in a portfolio with an average yield of 7%, my pot would grow. If I kept reinvesting the dividends I receive, it helps to grow the dividends further down the line. After 12 years, I could have received £13.1k just from dividends. In year 13, this could be an additional £1.7k."},

Further down the line when I’m thinking about retirement, I want to have a stream of income that I can rely on to help me enjoy life more. That’s the dream, isn’t it? I’d say so. And it’s more than possible. Even if I were starting from zero today, here’s the steps I’d take to start making some cash on the side. How to invest Before I started to think about how much I wanted to invest, the first step I’d take would be to open a Stocks and Shares ISA. That’s because I wouldn’t be taxed on any profit I made. From the dividend shares I’d be buying, I’d also be able to keep all of the passive income I received from dividend payments.

Readers are responsible for carrying out their own due diligence and for obtaining professional advice before making any investment decisions. Starting out So, I’ve decided I’m going to invest with my ISA. That’s the best way for me to set myself up for success. But what’s next? Well, now comes the most important part. It’s about getting started no matter how much money I have to invest. People are often deterred from investing as they believe that they need thousands of pounds or a cutting-edge investment strategy to see any gains. But that’s far from the case. How we start doesn’t matter. What’s imperative is that we start as early as possible and  over the long run  let the stock market work its magic. I think £100 a week is a sensible starting amount. Phoenix Group Holdings Let me show an example of just how powerful this can be. The stock I’m going to use is  Phoenix Group Holdings  ( LSE: PHNX ). It’s an insurance company and a leader in the sector. Its share price is down 1.8% so far this year. But a falling share price isn’t always a negative. For savvy investors, it means they can snap up bargains while the rest of the market overlooks it. At its current share price, it has a  dividend yield  of 10.1%, way above the FTSE 100 average (3.6%). I like Phoenix Holdings because it has a strong  balance sheet  with plenty of cash spare as well as a rising dividend payout. I see some risks. For example, the insurance industry is cyclical. What’s more, high interest rates and the uncertainty they spark can be detrimental to Phoenix Group’s operations. But given its strong position in the insurance industry, I’m bullish on the company. Money to be made Taking my £100 a week and applying it to Phoenix Group’s 10.1% yield ought to see me make slightly over £525 a year in passive income. Not bad. However, the longer I leave my money in the market, the better chance I have of building my wealth. If I adopt a 30-year investment timeframe and  reinvest  all the dividend payments I receive, at the end of that I’d be making £10,168 a year in second income. I’d have a nest egg worth £106,269. Investing always comes with risks and the stock market is volatile. There’s no guarantee that Phoenix Group’s yield will stay the same. It could rise or fall. Nevertheless, what this shows is that even investors starting from scratch are able to build a sizeable pot if they give it time."},

Readers are responsible for carrying out their own due diligence and for obtaining professional advice before making any investment decisions. So far, I’ve made good ground. With momentum on my side, I’m looking to add some brilliant companies to my ISA in July. Here are two stocks I reckon look like solid buying opportunities. If I had the cash, I’d buy them today. Unilever I want to add more  defensive stocks  to my portfolio and one that stands out is  Unilever  ( LSE: ULVR ). I recently opened a position in the consumer goods giant. It had been on my buy list for some time. I had some spare cash last month and decided to take the plunge. The stock has been gaining ground this year and I wanted a piece of the action. Year to date, it’s up 14.5%. Even with that rise, it’s trading on 20.2  times earnings . That’s above the Footsie average. But for a company of Unilever’s stature, I’m fine with paying a premium. What’s more, compared to its historical average, that actually looks cheap. Its defensive nature means it can bring stability to my portfolio in uncertain times, like the one we’re currently facing. Come rain or shine, there will be demand for the products it sells. Of course, its goods do come at a premium. And that means there’s the threat that consumers opt for cheaper goods from its competition. But Unilever’s brand recognition gives it an advantage. It’s also got a new management team in place that’s putting emphasis on creating a more efficient business. The stock has a healthy 3.4% dividend yield. Its payout hasn’t been cut for over 50 years. GSK I’m also keeping my eye on  GSK  ( LSE: GSK ). The stock hasn’t posted as strong a performance as its peer so far in 2024. This year it’s up 3.7%. In all fairness, a large chunk of the gains it had made were wiped out when its share price nosedived by over 10% last month. That came after a Delaware judge ruled in favour of more than 70,000 lawsuits related to  Zantac  and its link to causing cancer to go forward. GSK has been fighting this for a few years now. Speaking on the news, the business has said it will appeal and that there is “ no consistent or reliable evidence ” to suggest a cancer risk. It’s struggled to recover since the steep decline, falling a further 4.5%. With that, I think its shares now look like good value. They trade on 14.1 times earnings and 10.3 times forecast earnings.   Of course, GSK could end up facing huge liabilities from the litigation. And the persistent threat of legal action is a risk when investing in pharmaceutical stocks. But I’m bullish on GSK for the long run. Like Unilever, I’m a fan of the stability it provides. Where it has faced scrutiny for its weak pipeline in the past few years, this now seems to be changing as management focuses on growing it. It has 90 products in its R&D pipeline. Like Unilever, there’s also the chance to make passive income with its 3.8% yield."},

Many stocks have hit new highs in recent months and some long-struggling ones are making a comeback. But not all of them. Some companies just aren’t performing well and their future looks bleak. Two I’ll avoid this month are  Burberry  ( LSE: BRBY ) and  Diversified Energy Company  ( LSE: DEC ). Burberry  I’ve been waiting for Burberry to recover and I genuinely expected it would happen last month. For a brief period, it looked like the key 1,000p level would hold. It did in 2016 and again in 2020 after Covid. But on 26 June it made a move down and is now trading at 850p, near a 14-year low. The drop indicates there are almost no buyers left at that key level.

I wish I could say a recovery is imminent but the charts reveal little support below 1,000p.  \n Created on TradingView.com Now down 60% since last July, the UK’s most recognisable luxury fashion brand has had a tough year. But rather than bad management or changing consumer habits, I think it’s just suffering from a retracted economy. After all, it’s almost 200 years old so I don’t think it’s going away any time soon. In the 15-odd years after the 2008 financial crisis, the shares grew 1,530%. Once the economy recovers, it’s possible it could repeat that performance — or more! But I fear it may be a while before that happens. In the meantime, shareholders can take some comfort in the 7%  dividend yield . Diversified Energy Company Fund managers Qube Research and Bridgewater Associates opened short positions on this stock last month. Why? Well, the gas and oil producer recently slashed its dividend in half, meaning the attractive 17% yield will fall to 8%.  Typically, such drastic action is only taken when money is tight. With a hefty debt load and underwhelming FY 2023 results, the company’s board must be feeling the pressure. It’s already down 40% in the past year. And with the high yield being one of the stock’s key value propositions, further share price losses are likely.  Things aren’t all bad though. Equity increased throughout 2023, slightly reducing its debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio. And with earnings per share (EPS) at £16, the remaining dividend is well covered — albeit reduced. The firm was recently listed on the  New York Stock Exchange  (NYSE) and joined the  Russell 2000  this month. With the majority of its operations focused in the US Appalachian region, a shift in trading focus could help it recover.  It also made a series of acquisitions lately to help expand operations. Last month CEO Rusty Hutson said they will help it  “enhance our scale, deliver margin expansion, and expand free cash flow”.  Should the move pay off, its prospects may improve. But while that sounds promising, it’s not enough evidence to give me confidence. The debt load remains high and earnings are forecast to decline at 70% per year. With that in mind, I’m avoiding the shares for now."},

After rising by over 6%, the stock quickly came crashing down in late May following the announcement of the company’s full-year results. Its share price entered the year at 971.9p and climbed as high as 1,050.1p. Today, a share in the utility giant will set investors back just 891.9p. But now at its slashed price, could it be argued that National Grid looks like one of the best bargains on the  FTSE 100 ? Maybe. Defensive There are a couple of reasons why I think investors should consider buying National Grid shares today. The first is the fact that it’s a defensive stock. What it provides (gas and electricity) is needed regardless of factors such as how strongly the economy is performing. As such, National Grid shares have gained recognition for providing solid returns. In the last five years, the stock is up 15.8% whereas the FTSE 100 is up 9.9%. Not bad. Granted, the stock has experienced a blip as the 7-for-24 rights issue announcement in its results came as a major surprise for investors. But for those seeking stable returns over the long run, National Grid is a stock to consider. Passive income There’s also the  income  angle. Its  dividend yield  is currently 6.4%. That will be impacted by the rights issue. The move will increase share count and therefore dilute shareholder returns.  Nonetheless, its predicted yield after this comes into effect is still around 5.7%. The board has said that it plans to maintain its progressive dividend policy going forward. That’s a positive. Rights issue There’s then the rights issue itself to consider. It may have short-term drawbacks but I’m actually a fan of the move. That’s because the £7bn that National Grid will raise from it will be invested into its future. Over the next five years, CEO John Pettigrew said the firm will invest £60bn, nearly double the level of investment it has laid out in the past five years. Stumbling blocks While that’s all exciting, there are a few concerns I have. The first is its debt. At £43bn, that’s a big strain on its  balance sheet . High interest rates won’t help in paying that off either. There’s also the risk that comes with its grand plans for investing in its future operations. No doubt this will come at a major cost and there’s always the threat the business doesn’t see the return on investment that it expected. The same applies to its ongoing investments in renewable energy. The biggest bargain? I think the Footsie is full of undervalued shares right now, so to call National Grid the biggest bargain on the index might be a stretch. But even so, it’s a stock I think investors should consider buying today. I suspect the majority of shareholders own National Grid for steady and no-fuss income. The rights issue probably came as a shock and I reckon the market has overreacted. That means now could be a chance to take a closer look at it. That’s what I’ll be doing."},

That’s 8.8% lower than it was at the offset of the year. It’s 17.8% less than it was five years ago. That doesn’t make great reading for long-term shareholders. Especially when you consider that the  FTSE 100  has been on the rise this year. But for potential investors, or shareholders like me who are considering adding to their position, where does that leave us? Based on its performance in recent times, Legal & General may seem like a stock that should be avoided. But there are positives to a falling share price. One of the best One is a rising  dividend yield . And as far as yields on the Footsie go, Legal & General’s one of the best. At a whopping 8.8%, that places it as the fifth highest on the index. It’s only topped by  Vodafone ,  Phoenix Group Holdings ,  British American Tobacco , and  M&G . Vodafone is cutting its yield in half next year, which makes Legal & General’s yield look even more impressive. Sustainability But what’s the point of a high yield if there’s not the potential of it being sustained, or hopefully rising, in the times to come? Dividends are never, ever guaranteed, so doing proper due diligence and investigating whether a yield looks sustainable is key. Luckily, with Legal & General, I reckon it is. Its yield has been on a steady rise over the last decade. Its cumulative dividend plan, set to end this year, is further proof that its management is placing emphasis on rewarding shareholders. Valuation Its falling share price also means a more attractive valuation. Today, Legal & General trades on a  forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio  of 8.6. That’s below the Footsie average (11). Taking a look at its industry peers, it’s also cheaper than  Aviva , which trades on a forward P/E of 11.7, as well as  AIG , which trades on 10.7. Not without risks Its cheap valuation comes with risks. For example, the stock’s cyclical. Its performance can often go through peaks and troughs as the economy goes through ups and downs. We’re dealing with lots of economic uncertainty at the moment, hence its cheaper price. Unfortunately, I’m expecting this downward trajectory to continue in the months ahead. And that’s going to have a direct impact on Legal & General. Its assets under management will most likely continue to wobble. I’m bullish But looking past that, I’m bullish on the firm’s longer-term performance. The business has strong brand recognition and a large customer base in a growing industry. It has also recently laid out plans to boost its efficiency. Those are all things I love to see. An opportunity I think Legal & General offers a great opportunity to make passive income. At its current value, I also see lots of potential for share price growth in the years to come. I started to snap up shares in July last year. As I write, I’m sitting on a 4.8% paper gain. But I’m in it for the long haul. And the opportunity to make extra income is one of the main reasons I’ll continue to buy shares with any spare cash I have. I reckon investors should consider buying it too."},

They offer investors cracking opportunities to purchase high-quality household names and build long-term wealth. That suits my investment strategy down to a tee. Here are two that have especially caught my eye. I think investors should consider buying them this month. A homebuilder The first of my two picks is homebuilder  Taylor Wimpey  ( LSE: TW. ). Despite rising 39.1% in the last 12 months, the stock hasn’t performed great so far this year. During the first half of 2024, it lost 1.4% of its value. Clearly, the stock missed out on the Footsie rally. But I’m not going to complain. I now see good value in Taylor Wimpey. Its stagnating share price has pushed up its  dividend yield . The stock now has the 10th-highest payout on the index at 6.7%. Its dividend experienced a healthy rise last year to 9.58p per share, up nearly 2% from the year prior. What’s more, after a tough couple of years, there are positive signs starting to emerge from the housing market. Firstly, interest rate cuts seem like they’re getting ever closer. With inflation for May falling to the 2% target, that’ll help. Lower rates will revive people’s appetites for taking out a mortgage and drive demand for Taylor Wimpey. Looking more  long term , it’s no secret that the UK has a major housing shortage. And building more homes has been a major point of discussion in the upcoming election. That’s another reason I’m bullish on the firm. That said, a delay in rate cuts would harm its share price. In the short term, I suspect the stock may continue to struggle. We’re not out of the woods yet with inflation and a rise over the next few months could see investors turn their backs on Taylor Wimpey. But as a long-term play, I like the look of its shares. I reckon July could be a smart time to consider getting in and buying the homebuilder. A supermarket giant I’ve also had industry giant  Tesco  ( LSE: TSCO ) on my watchlist for a while. July could be a shrewd time to consider buying its shares too, in my opinion. The share price has had a better start to the year than its Footsie counterpart. It’s up 5.1% during that time and 24.8% over the last year. But trading at 12.6 times earnings, I still think Tesco shares look like value for money. I also like the company due to its incredibly strong brand recognition and dominant market position. That said, competition is a threat. Aldi and Lidl continue to take the industry by storm and have become even more popular during the cost-of-living crisis due to their budget prices. That’s something to watch. Yet despite these threats, Tesco has found a way to retain its position at the top. I suspect its smart schemes such as its Clubcard programme, which now has around 20m users, that has kept it there. There’s also the chance to make some extra cash on the side with its 3.9% yield. That’s above the Footsie average. If I had the cash, I’d snap up both stocks this month."},

And it’s no wonder, with inflation skyrocketing, one income just doesn’t cut it these days. But with my efforts already concentrated eight hours a day on my current graft, I don’t have time to take on extra work. That’s why I think the easiest way is by investing in high-yield dividend stocks. These are stocks that pay shareholders just for the pleasure of their investment. It doesn’t require any effort beyond buying the shares. Naturally, this means tying up my spare cash in an investment account — but it can pay off in the long run. How’s it done? This is my strategy. Secure the best investment account For UK residents, I believe the best way to maximise returns is with a  Stocks and Shares ISA . This popular investment product allows the user to invest up to £20,000 a year tax-free into the asset of their choice! That can add up to a lot of savings when taking into account the miracle of compound returns. Many companies offer ISAs with varying benefits and fees so there’s something for everyone.

How to gauge dividend value There are a few things to look out for when selecting  dividend stocks . Most investors have heard of dividend yields, but there’s more to it than that. Yields change constantly due to fluctuating prices, so a high yield today might not be there tomorrow. A more important metric to check is the consistency of payments and dividend growth. If a stock price increases rapidly, the yield can decrease even while the dividend increases. So a yield alone is not necessarily a good indicator of long-term value. For example, both  Phoenix Group  and  British American Tobacco  ( LSE: BATS ) have dividend yields of around 10%. Phoenix’s dividends have enjoyed eight consecutive years of growth at an average rate of 2.65%. However, British American’s dividend has increased every year since the millennium began, with an average growth rate of 5.91%. At that rate, an investment of £10,000 with even minimal share price appreciation could grow to £127,764 in 20 years (with dividends reinvested). That would pay an annual dividend of £14,233 — almost £1,200 a month. There’s no guarantee that will happen and dividends can also fall or be axed. But rewards are more likely when choosing a stock with a long track record of payments. Tobacco? Really? On the downside, a tobacco company may not be the best option for long-term growth. British American will need to continue pivoting into alternative products if it hopes to remain relevant, as global legislation increasingly leans toward banning tobacco. Newly imposed regulations have already begun hurting the share price, down 10% in the past five years. Both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) missed analyst estimates in 2023.  If things don’t improve it will struggle to keep paying such a good dividend.  Fortunately, it’s working on it, with the “ aim to become a predominantly smokeless business by 2035 .” Its new campaign, A Better Tomorrow, aims to convert 50 million consumers to non-combustible products by 2030, already accounting for 16.5% of revenue. Since learning of this new initiative, I plan on adding the shares to my dividend portfolio this month."},

This is one of the major perks Britons gain by investing in the stock market via an ISA. So when I come across the attractive yield of  Tesco  ( LSE:TSCO ) shares, it got me thinking about the income potential.

It is not intended to be, neither does it constitute, any form of tax advice. Readers are responsible for carrying out their own due diligence and for obtaining professional advice before making any investment decisions. A track record At the moment, the Tesco share’s  dividend yield  is 3.95%. This is above the  FTSE 100  3.62% average. I understand that some might not get too excited about this yield. However, it does have a strong track record of paying out sustainable income. Aside from a blip in 2016 following the losses from the previous year, Tesco has paid out some form of dividend for over two decades. I’d much rather own a stock that I’m confident about paying dividends at circa 4% than buy a stock that yields 8% but is in financial trouble. Looking forward, I’m confident Tesco will be able to pay out income based on the financial results. In a trading update released in June, UK sales grew by 4.6% versus the same quarter last year. The growth in sales over the past year has filtered down to the bottom line. The profit before tax for 2023 was a generous £2.29bn, the best result since before the pandemic. It’s this kind of profit that provides the cash flow for a dividend to get paid. Trusting in the UK Tesco’s also a bellwether for the general UK economy. The stock’s up 21% over the past year, which I feel reflects the sentiment around lower inflation and stronger consumer confidence. For inflation, the latest May reading showed it’s now dropped to 2%, the central bank target. Remember when it was above 10% and grocery inflation was going through the roof? The opposite should now help Tesco keep its profit margins healthy. Consumer confidence is also improving from the cost-of-living crisis last year. We’re expecting interest rates to be cut at the end of the summer which should give us even more reason to cheer. This should help Tesco via higher customer spending. However, the sensitivity of the stock to the performance of the UK is also a risk. It wouldn’t take much for us to head back into a recession. Even though Tesco’s a defensive stock, I still feel this would cause the share price to fall. Numbers going forward In terms of numbers, let’s assume I invest all of my £20k allowance for my ISA this year in Tesco shares at a yield of 4%. If I reinvested the payments over time, after a decade I could make £9.8k just from dividends. Then in year 11 alone, I could stand to make just over £100 a month. Considering this is just one stock and doesn’t include the rest of my portfolio, I’d say this is pretty impressive. Although I don’t urgently need another income stock, I’m still considering buying Tesco shares now."},

After all, there are 27 stocks on the index that offer a  dividend yield  of 7% or more. The Footsie, on the other hand, has just seven. That said, I’m not just looking for the highest yield. While that may be an enticing investment strategy, it’s not always the most sustainable. Shareholders of telecommunications giant  Vodafone , which is set to cut its payout in half next year, know that all too well. That’s why I like the look of these two FTSE 250 constituents. They offer attractive yields. But I’m also confident that they have the potential to keep rising in the years ahead. I own both stocks but if I had the spare cash I’d happily add to my position in them today.  ITV My first pick is  ITV  ( LSE: ITV ). It’s a company that needs no introduction. Today, it yields an impressive 6.2%. That’s above the FTSE 250 average, which is 3.3%. That said, I’m more drawn in by management’s ambitions to grow its payout over the medium term. The stock had been in the doldrums over the last few years. But it has slowly been making a recovery. In the last 12 months, it has climbed an impressive 20.4% compared to the FTSE 250’s 13.2% rise. It has posted a large chunk of its turnaround this year, rising 28.1%. Despite its rise, I reckon the stock looks like good value for money. It trades on 15.6 times earnings. That trumps the FTSE 250 average, which is around 12. Even so, I’m comfortable paying a slight premium for a business of ITV’s quality. Looking forward, the firm will face challenges. Streaming providers have taken the shine off of traditional TV as they continue to rise in popularity. But ITV is aware of this and adapting as a result. It’s on track to reach its 2026 key targets, including £750m in revenue for its digital ops. I reckon now could be a smart time to think about this one. Games Workshop I’m also a massive fan of  Games Workshop  ( LSE: GAW ). It’s been a staple of my portfolio for a few years now. The stock yields 3.9%. That’s far from breathtaking. But Games Workshop only uses “ truly surplus cash ” to pay shareholders and has an incredibly strong  balance sheet  with zero debt. It’s for reasons like that its dividend payment has steadily increased over the last decade.  I’m also bullish on the stock due to its leading industry position. It’s the biggest player in the miniature wargames industry by some stretch. That gives it a major edge over any rivals. However, I think we could see competition ramp up in the coming years and that will provide a threat to the firm. Its share price has also experienced major swings in years gone by, so volatility during tough trading conditions could potentially be expected. But even during tough times, the business seems to prove its resilience. In June it announced that it expects core revenue to come in “ not less than ” £490m. That’s a 10% jump from last year when revenue totalled £445m."},

In the last 12 months, the stock has posted a thumping 193.5% gain. This year alone has seen it soar 53.9%. Despite the  FTSE 100 ’s impressive 5.8% rise year to date, the Rolls performance has blown it out of the water. But what’s next for the stock? Surely it can’t continue to surge? A skyrocketing stock To answer that, let’s start by looking at why Rolls has soared in recent times. There are a few main reasons. First, the firm has provided investors with numerous positive updates over the last couple of months. For example, a trading update released in May highlighted that in its civil aerospace unit, engine flying hours had returned to pre-Covid levels in the opening four months of the year. On top of that, the business has made good strides in strengthening its  balance sheet . It has reduced the large amount of debt it had on its books and that has helped it improve its credit rating with major agencies, which is a big positive. The heavy burden of its debt was a big concern of mine before. There’s also the impact that CEO Tufan Erginbilgic has had. From the get go the former  BP  executive asserted himself as a bold leader with grand ambitions. So far, he’s not only talking the talk but he’s also walking the walk. Last year, operating profit reached just shy of £1.6bn up from £652m the year before. By 2027, Rolls is aiming for up to £2.8bn in operating profit. If it goes on to achieve that, its share price could look like a steal at its current level. A  justified rise? But when a stock rises so much in a short space of time, I’m also dubious. Who can blame me? The stock market is full of surprises. Investors could be getting carried away with Rolls and at the first sign of a slowdown its share price could sharply recoil. That’s probably the biggest threat I see with the company. It’s why I’ve been hesitant to open a position in the Footsie giant. I really like the business and where it’s going under Erginbilgic. But when investigating the fundamentals, I see a few issues. The stock is trading on the expensive side. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio is 28.9. The Footsie average, for comparison, is around 11. I’m fine with paying a premium for a company like Rolls. After all, it’s a British stalwart with a large customer base and incredibly strong brand recognition. Even so, I think that’s too pricey for my liking. The plan of action Stocks can’t keep rising forever. And while Rolls has posted an impressive turnaround since the pandemic, it’s inevitable that this growth will slow and the company will hit some speed bumps in the times ahead. At that point, I think we could see its share price pull back. If that occurs, that’s when I’d make a move. I’ll buy the dip and tuck Rolls away in my portfolio for the long run. Until then, I’m sitting tight."},

With interest rates set to fall, dividends should come back into focus. Here, I’m going to highlight three dividend stocks that are  dirt cheap  right now. I think they’re worth a closer look as we start the second half of the year.  Rising dividends First up is oil giant  Shell  ( LSE: SHEL ). It currently trades on a  price-to-earnings  (P/E) ratio of just 8.5 versus the market average of 13.6. The  yield  here is about 4.1% right now. That’s not the highest out there, but dividend coverage (the ratio of earnings to dividends) is very strong. This means that the payout is most likely secure and that there’s scope for dividend increases going forward. It’s worth noting that analysts expect a 5.5% increase in the payout next year. That would take the yield to about 4.3%, which may be higher than savings account interest rates they come down a few percentage points. Now, Shell does have to navigate a few challenges including the global shift to clean energy and the move away from non-ESG stocks by investors. But at a P/E ratio of 8.5, a lot of this stuff is probably already baked into the share price. Assuming oil prices don’t tank, I think this stock can do well in the years ahead. High yields Next, we have banking giant  HSBC  ( LSE: HSBA ). Its P/E ratio’s currently just seven. The dividend yield here looks very attractive right now. If we exclude the special dividend for this year (which was paid out recently), it’s about 7%. In a world of falling interest rates, that stands out to me. Dividend coverage is very healthy, meaning the chance of a cut is low. I’ll point out that falling rates are not ideal for banks. As rates drop, there’s less scope to generate profits from loans. And rates aren’t the only risk here. Investors also need to consider economic conditions in China – a country HSBC has significant exposure to. I believe the risks are worth taking on however, given the 7% dividend. To be able to get that kind of a yield from a well-established, blue-chip company like HSBC is fantastic, in my view. Attractive total returns Finally, check out FTSE 250 engineering company  Keller Group  ( LSE: KLR ). It currently trades on a P/E ratio of about 8.1. The dividend yield here’s about 3.8% currently. Again, that’s not super high. But I don’t see that as a deal breaker. Keller specialises in preparing ground to build on. And right now, it’s having a lot of success in the US. Recently, it said its full-year results were likely to be “ materially ahead ” of its previous expectations. This led to a number of brokers raising their price targets (the consensus price target is 1,512p, 23% above the current share price). So I think there’s potential for strong total returns (gains plus dividends) in the years ahead. The main risk with this stock is an economic slowdown. This would most likely have a negative impact on construction companies. With the US government currently pumping billions into infrastructure however, I like the look of Keller."},

I’ve been snapping them up over the last few years given how cheap they look. One way to highlight how affordable UK shares are right now is to look at the Footsie’s average  price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio . Currently, it’s  just 11. That’s a good way off what it has been. Its historical average is between 14 and 15. As a result, I reckon there are a host of buying opportunities out there that investors should consider capitalising on. The UK stock market’s excelled so far this year. If it keeps up this momentum, it looks like many of the bargain share prices on offer won’t be around for much longer. Value in the UK It’s not just me who thinks investing in the UK looks like a smart idea either. For example, financial services giant  Hargreaves Lansdown  recently said: “ The underperformance of the UK market has led to a big gap opening in valuations, with many UK companies starting to look quite cheap compared to their US peers ”. Don’t get me wrong, there are plenty of companies in the US that look exciting investment propositions. The obvious example is  Nvidia , which continues to soar and is a stock I own. But for investors who are on the hunt for shares offering  long-term  value, I reckon the UK’s the best place to look at the moment. Acting fast Investors have been flocking to the UK recently. As such, the cheap share prices on offer won’t last forever. According to Hargreaves Lansdown, the current mismatch in valuations “is  not usually sustainable for any length of time, and indeed we have started to see this valuation gap narrow already ”. That’s why I want to act fast. And I’m keen to top up my position in  Barclays  ( LSE: BARC ) this month. Its share price has shot up 32.3% this year. Nonetheless, it still looks like a bargain trading on just 7.9 times earnings. Furthermore, the stock’s trading on 6.5 times forward earnings. Its  price-to-book ratio , a common valuation metric for banks, is just 0.4. Falling interest rates are the most obvious threat to Barclays. Banks have seen their margins expand as they’ve enjoyed a spell of higher rates. With it likely the Bank of England will start bringing rates down this year, that will see the firm’s net interest income fall. But with the business placing more focus on streamlining, I like the look of where it’s going. This has been a major issue for the bank in recent years. As a shareholder, I’m glad to see CEO CS Venkatakrishnan addressing the issue. I must also mention its healthy 3.9% dividend yield is covered three times by earnings. That will offer a nice stream of passive income for my portfolio. With the income I receive, I plan to reinvest it back into purchasing more cheap shares. That way I can grow my wealth quicker. All in all, Barclays is a brilliant example of a cheap UK stock I think investors should consider buying today. If I had the cash, I’d happily add to my position."},

Traditonally, the red party has championed higher taxation and tighter business regulations than the Conservatives. And this has sometimes had an adverse impact on  FTSE 100  shares. But markets are much calmer this time around, with those in the City encouraged by current party leader Keir Starmer’s vow to work closely with business to boost growth. Pledges to improve relations with the European Union have also gone down well with investors and economists. Sea of calm In one such example, Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at  Hargreaves Lansdown , has predicted that asset prices will remain robust should Starmer enter Downing Street. She says that “ in all likelihood, the impact of a Labour victory on financial markets would be minimal, especially if the current poll predictions materialise .” Latest polling numbers from  YouGov Looking at election outcomes, Streeter says that “ a minority administration or coalition would be more unsettling as it would mean more uncertainty, and could hold back investment. “ Streeter adds that a large majority “ would enable the new government to get on with their agenda which has largely been digested by markets .” A potential FTSE winner That said, there are some important things for investors to remember. Parties can fail to deliver their manifesto promises, both intentionally and unintentionally. What’s more, other major events can happen that derail a government’s plans and cause stock markets to sink. The Covid-19 pandemic erupted merely months after the Conservatives won the 2019 general election. And in the aftermath, the  FTSE 100  collapsed to multi-year lows. But there could be some major winners on London’s stock market if Labour carries out its post-election plans. One of these could be residential construction companies like  Persimmon  ( LSE:PSN ) which, in my opinion, already looks in good shape to grow sales as the UK’s population increases. Analyst Streeter also notes that “ Labour’s pledge to build 1.5m new homes by shaking up the planning system would benefit housebuilders facing slow approvals of new sites .” However, she does caution that “ it remains to be seen how quickly this can be done .” Persimmon has previously claimed that “ the planning environment and limited land supply pose significant barriers to development and home delivery “. But reducing regulations is a contentious issue, and housebuilder shares could fall sharply should Labour’s plans run into trouble. Renewables boost Renewable energy stocks like  SSE  ( LSE:SSE ) could also rise in value if polling projections prove correct. Labour announced in its manifesto that it plans to “ work with the private sector to double onshore wind, triple solar power, and quadruple offshore wind by 2030 “. As with the housing market, Labour has vowed to ease planning restrictions for new wind farms within weeks, should they win the election. This would be a big boost to SSE, which is focusing on wind power to drive future earnings. More favourable planning regulations don’t make the FTSE 100 a slam dunk buy however. Building renewable energy assets is famously expensive and a significant drag on  profits . That said, I still believe SSE should thrive as the climate crisis drives green energy expansion. It could be a strong performer, regardless of who wins the election."},

I’m hoping in the decades ahead I’ll be joining this illustrious group. But what will help me get there? Well, that’s what I’m here to explore. The recipe It seems there are a few key ingredients to the recipe for having over a million quid stashed away in an ISA. The first is one we preach here at  The Motley Fool  is that  building wealth takes time . Contrary to what many people tend to promote nowadays on the internet, generating wealth from the stock market isn’t an overnight process. According to a recent report from the investment powerhouse, the average age of one of its ISA millionaires is 74. By comparison, the average age of its regular Stocks and Shares ISA investors is 51. The second is focused more on where to invest. And it seems UK equities are where investors should strongly consider looking right now. ISA millionaires on average have 44.7% of their cash tied up in the UK as opposed to 38.5% for all Hargreaves Lansdown ISA clients. The UK stock market’s jam-packed with bargains right now and shrewd investors seem to be making the most of that. Putting it into practice But putting this into practice, which type of stocks look like a savvy buy right now? I reckon  Shell  ( LSE: SHEL ) could be a great shout for investors to consider buying. In the last 12 months, the stock’s posted a cracking performance. During that time, it’s returned 21.5%. Zooming out, in the last decade, it’s returned a steady 16.1%. That said, its share price has experienced large peaks and troughs during that time. And that’s one of the largest threats I see with the business. The stock’s highly cyclical. When the price of oil rises, as it did during the pandemic, the Shell share price often blossoms. On the other hand, when prices fall, like we saw across the first half of June, the stock can suffer. Even so, BP shares look dirt cheap today. They’re trading on 8.1 times  forward earnings . That’s below the  FTSE 100  average of around 11. Enhancing gains To go with that, there’s also the chance to make some passive income. BP has a dividend yield of 3.8%, slightly above the average of its Footsie peers. To build wealth even quicker, with the income I received, I’d simply reinvest it back into buying more shares. By doing that, I’d benefit from dividend  compounding , which is an effective method to snowball gains. Its yield is also forecast to rise this year. Management’s reiterated its desire to continue returning value to shareholders. We’ve seen this in action with its latest $3.5bn  share buyback  scheme. Investing in the business won’t come without challenges. Aside from volatility, it faces other issues such as potential rising windfall taxes. But by copying ISA millionaires and investing for the long run, I reckon shares like Shell will one day help me reach the milestone. If I had the cash, it’s a stock I’d strongly consider buying today."},

[Just beginning your investing journey? Check out our guide on  how to start investing in the UK .] Diageo What it does: Diageo is the brewer and distiller behind a host of premium drinks worldwide, from  Guinness  to  Johnnie Walker . By  Christopher Ruane . With a 3.2% dividend yield,  Diageo  ( LSE: DGE ) might not look like a hot dividend share at first glance. But from the perspective of how it can fund future dividend growth, I like the share a lot. This is a company that has grown its payout per share annually for well over three decades. Those are not tokenistic increases, either: the dividend has increased by 5% in both of the past couple of years. High demand, premium positioning and unique products give the company strong pricing power. The business model generates sizeable free cash flows: £1.8bn last year alone. I therefore expect Diageo can raise its dividend for years to come. Weakening sales in Latin America concern me. They could foreshadow a broader slowdown in premium drinks demand as global economic weakness bites. As a long-term investor, though, I think the outlook for Diageo is promising. Christopher Ruane does not own shares in Diageo. HSBC What it does: HSBC is an international bank with a presence in over 60 countries. By  Charlie Keough . I already own  HSBC  ( LSE: HSBA ) shares but at their current price, I’m incredibly tempted to buy some more in July. The star of the show is its 7.1% dividend yield. Last year its payout grew by 97% to 61 cents per share. In its Q1 results, it announced a special 21 cents per share dividend after selling its Canadian business. Accounting for that, the stock yields a whopping 11.8%. HSBC shares also look cheap. They trade on 7.5 times earnings, comfortably below the  FTSE 100  average. Its price-to-book ratio is 0.9. The biggest threat to the firm is its focus on Asia. A slowdown in Chinese economic growth could weigh down on the stock in the months to come. But moving past that, I’m bullish on HSBC. Its shares are cheap, and its yield is high. That’s the sort of stock I like to buy. If I have the cash, I’ll be adding to my position this month. Charlie Keough owns shares in HSBC. Legal & General Group What it does: Legal & General Group sells a wide range of life insurance, retirement and investment products. Legal & General Group  ( LSE:LGEN ) shares have long been popular with investors seeking an extraordinary passive income. Following recent heavy price weakness, it looks even more appealing from a dividend perspective. The  FTSE 100  company now carries an enormous 9.5% dividend yield for 2024. And for 2025 and 2026, these figures improve to 10.1% and 10.7% respectively. Investors have been spooked by Legal & General’s intention to cool future dividend growth. It announced plans in mid-June to raise annual payouts by 2% between 2025 and 2027, down from 5% previously. I think the market is overreacting here. Not only are dividends  still  expected to grow. But the financial services giant plans to “ return more to shareholders ” overall by launching a series of share buybacks. This begins with a £200m repurchase this year. There’s always a chance that Legal & General may struggle to hit these goals if the economy struggles and profits suffer. But a cash-rich balance sheet suggests the firm could still make good on its revised capital allocation policy, even if earnings disappoint. Royston Wild owns shares in Legal & General Group. Phoenix Group Holdings. What it does: Phoenix calls itself the UK’s largest long-term savings and retirement business, with 12m customers and £280bn of assets under administration.  By  Harvey Jones . Maybe I’m naive, but I just can’t get past the fact that FTSE 100 insurance conglomerate  Phoenix Group Holdings  ( LSE: PHNX ) yields 10.2% today. I know double-digit yields are highly precarious, and I know there are a few other reasons to invest in the stock, which is down 4.05% over one year and 24.95% over five. But I still thinks it’s a brilliant buy The market may just be coming round to my point of view, with the shares springing into life in recent days. What’s taken them so long? I’ve just run some figures, and Phoenix has a solid track record of increasing its dividend per share for the last decade. In 2014, it paid 36.75p per share. By 2023, that had risen to 52.65p. In March, the board pledged to offer a  “progressive and sustainable dividend policy ” going forward. Analysts expect the yield to hit 10.5% in 2024 and 10.8% in 2025. The business is paying down debt, too. No dividend is guaranteed. Some investors will see this as a value trap. The share price may continue to flounder. But I’m an optimist.

While many companies pay a dividend, we tend to look for those with larger payments relative to the share price. This gives them a higher dividend yield.  So here are three stocks I think investors could consider if they’re looking for sizeable dividend payouts. They all have risks, but also potentially high rewards. Nordic American Tankers I’ll start with the caveat that this stock,  Nordic American Tankers  ( NYSE:NAT ), underperformed in Q1. Analysts, including myself, were expecting some blockbuster results because Houthi attacks on vessels transiting the Red Sea had pushed the price of leasing vessels way up. Spot rates — the cost of leasing a Nordic American vessel — remain elevated versus historic levels. This is not just because of Red Sea events, but because of a broader mismatch between supply and demand. Analysts had been warning for some time that an imbalance was building in the tanker sector with new vessel orders falling drastically during the pandemic. As a result, just two supertankers are coming online this year.  As such, Nordic American, with its relatively young fleet of Suezmax tankers, should be in a great position to benefit during the medium term. The issue is, it needs to perform better than it did it Q1. It underperformed all of its peers, and it’s not clear why. Currently, the stock offers a whopping 11.2% dividend yield. Phoenix Group Shares in  Phoenix Group  ( LSE:PHNX ) have recently fallen after announcing the possible sale of its SunLife business. In turn, this pushed the dividend yield above 10%.  The UK’s largest long-term savings and retirement business is transitioning from a closed-book life consolidator to a purpose-led retirement savings and income business.  It’s much more growth-oriented than it used to be, and that’s why the sale of SunLife doesn’t bother me. If it’s part of the transformation plan, I’m all for it. Phoenix is also seizing the opportunities presented by the Pension Risk Transfer trend, supported by its in-house asset management expertise.  For now, interest rates remain an issue, putting downward pressure on asset prices. However, I certainly believe it’s a  FTSE 100   stock worth watching closely. TBC Bank Group TBC Bank  ( LSE:TBCG ) is a Georgian banking group listed on the UK stock exchange. The stock’s seen some pull back in recent months due to political factors. With thousands taking to the streets of Tbilisi to protest against the ‘foreign agents’ law, and an election in a few months, investors are rightly concerned about stability.  Stability is key to economic growth, and banks are cyclical stocks. And this is why TBC Bank stock has dipped along with its Georgian peers.  I certainly think this is a stock worth keeping an eye on. Georgia has been Europe’s fastest growing economy since the pandemic and, politics aside, it could be a great growth market to have exposure to. The stock currently offers an 8.8% dividend yield.  If I invested £10,000 in these three stocks, I could earn £1,000 annually in passive income and I think it’s worth keeping up to date with any developments relating to them."},

Looking at the UK stock market, I’ve identified three  FTSE 100  shares I’d buy to create a nice second income if I had a spare £15,000 to do so. National Grid National Grid  ( LSE:NG ) shares recently fell after underwhelming earnings and a dividend rebasement. Gross revenue declined by 10% while operating profit also fell by 11%. A particular concern for me is also the £44.8bn of debt on its  balance sheet . However, the company is still the key electricity distributor for the UK and I expect demand for electricity to continue rising over time. Furthermore, management is planning to invest £60bn between now and 2029 to address the debt problem. It will be used on projects, such as the decarbonisation of its energy infrastructure. This should improve supply and lower bills for consumers through efficiency, ultimately bolstering its long-term economic growth. Moreover, the dividend rebasement (arising from its £7bn rights issue) isn’t as perilous as it first seems. The  dividend yield  is expected to dip to 5.3% in 2025 but is expected to grow from there. This is still far superior to the average FTSE 100 yield of 3.6%, making it a great share to generate a stable second income. Aviva Aviva  ( LSE:AV ) shares have had a strong 2024 so far, climbing by 11%. This has outperformed the Footsie that has only increased by 6%. And there’s a reason why. In its latest accounts, gross written premiums have risen by 13% year on year and operating profit rose by 9%. The company currently boasts a dividend yield of 7%. My (hypothetical) £15,000 invested in it would therefore make roughly £1,050 in annual income. Not bad at all! With a strong track record of it raising dividends, this is likely to rise over time too. There are risks with Aviva. It’s a naturally cyclical business due to its involvement in the financial services sector. Therefore, in economically fragile times, some people might not be able to afford to take out insurance policies. However, the opposite is true when the economy performs well and that seems to be turning a corner in the UK. With inflation also falling, now might be a good time for me to grab some of its shares. Legal & General To finish off, I’ve chosen another financial services firm. But  Legal & General  ( LSE:LGEN ) shares have seen different fortunes, falling by over 8% in 2024. The company recently announced a restructuring with new financial targets, including international growth, particularly in the US. It believes this could increase operating earnings per share by 6%-9% annually between 2024 and 2027. This announcement didn’t fly well with investors though, as the firm cut the expected annual dividend growth rate to 5% in 2024 and only 2% between 2025 to 2027. However, this doesn’t concern me so much as the company already possesses a monster dividend yield of 9%. My £15,000 invested in this stock would therefore make me roughly £1,350 annually. My one concern is that there’s always a risk that expanding abroad may not be executed well. But sometimes to fuel growth a company has to take risks, so this could also be an opportunity that is good for its earnings."},

That’s a good result , but the headline number masks some pretty depressing results. Only 35 stocks are outperforming the index this year. And even among those, the news isn’t necessarily as positive as it looks. Acquisitions The best-performing FTSE 100 stock so far this year has been  Darktrace , which is up 61%. The trouble is, that’s not because the business is growing –  it’s being taken over . Back in April, the company accepted an acquisition bid from private equity company Thoma Bravo. That’s completely changed the equation for anyone thinking about buying its shares. The question now isn’t how much cash the firm can generate, it’s how much it will be sold for. And it’s not just Darktrace – the same is true for  Hargreaves Lansdown  and  DS Smith . I find it depressing that the best returns from the FTSE 100 have come due to acquisitions, rather than growth. But in any event, it’s hard to see much opportunity here going forward.  Pandemic recoveries The other big theme at the top of the FTSE 100 is the exit from Covid-19. The most obvious example is  Rolls-Royce , which has benefitted from a recovery in aircraft flying hours. The Rolls-Royce share price is up 54% since the start of the year. And in the banking sector,  NatWest  and  Barclays  have fared well as interest rates approached more normal levels.  In each of these cases though, I think the momentum is starting to wear off. Engine flying hours have reached pre-pandemic levels and interest rates look set to fall from these levels. Unlike the acquisition targets, there has been genuine growth from Rolls-Royce, NatWest, and Barclays. But I think it’s difficult to make a case for buying any of them at the moment. Where are the opportunities? I think  Bunzl  ( LSE:BNZL ) has about as much chance of being acquired as the Monster Raving Loony Party has of winning the election outright. But the firm looks very likely to grow its earnings over time.  The company distributes consumables like paper plates, hygiene products, and carrier bags. Weak trading – especially in the US – has caused the stock to fall 5% so far this year. With 60% of revenues coming from the US, there’s clearly a risk this might continue. But the company has some important long-term advantages that investors should pay attention to. Most notably, the company’s size and scale allows it to provide customers with an unrivalled service. And it allows Bunzl to keep making acquisitions of its own to boost its earnings.  UK shares The FTSE 100 has done well so far this year. But I’m doubtful the forces that propelled share prices over the last six months will continue to push them higher over the long term. Instead, I’m looking to invest in companies that can make their shares more valuable by growing their earnings over time. Fortunately, some of these haven’t fared so well this year. Bunzl is a great example. The stock might be down 5% since the start of the year, but its growth prospects and its competitive position still look as strong as they were before."},

Is this overlooked FTSE 100 stock an unmissable bargain?", "title_link": "https://www.fool.co.uk/2024/07/01/a-9-5-yield-but-down-11-is-this-overlooked-ftse-100-stock-an-unmissable-bargain/", "published_date": "1 July, 2024", "publisher_name": "Simon Watkins", "Description": "The broad devaluation of the  FTSE 100  after 2016’s Brexit decision has provided multiple investment opportunities, in my view. Many companies continue to trade well under their fair value, for example. And given that yields rise as share prices fall, others now pay very high dividends. British American Tobacco  ( LSE: BATS ) is one share that covers both bases, I think. Big dividend payer The average yield in the  FTSE 100  now is 3.6%, but British American Tobacco’s is a stunning 9.5%. So £11,000 (the average UK savings amount) would make £1,045 in first-year dividend payments. Over 10 years, that would add another £10,450 to the initial £11,000 investment. Much more could be made by using the dividends paid to buy more of the stock – known as ‘dividend compounding’. Given the same average 9.5% yield, this would produce an extra £16,261 instead of £10,450. Over 30 years on that yield, the total investment would be worth £167,423. This would pay £15,905 a year in dividends, or £1,325 each month. Is a high dividend sustainable? Growth in earnings and profits are the keys to increases in dividends over time. In British American Tobacco’s case, adjusted operational profit last year rose 3.1% from 2022 — to £12.47bn. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 4% over the same period to 375.6p. A risk in the shares is that its ongoing transition to nicotine substitute products falters, allowing its competitors to gain an advantage. Another is legal action arising from the negative health effects of its tobacco products in the past. However, consensus analysts’ expectations are that its earnings will soar by 51.5% a year to the end of 2026. This is reflected in analysts’ forecasts for rising dividend payments over that period. These are for 236.70p a share this year, 246.5p in 2025, and 258.8p in 2026. This would give respective yields on the current £24.35 share price of 9.7%, 10.1%, and 10.6%. A huge bargain? Even better is that this enormous passive income potential can be secured for a bargain-basement price, in my view. A key measurement of a stock’s relative value to other shares is the  price-to-earnings  (P/E) ratio. British American Tobacco currently trades at a P/E of 6.8 compared to a peer group average of 13.4. So it is very undervalued on this basis.   To find out by how much, I ran a  discounted cash flow  analysis using other analysts’ figures and my own. This shows the company to be 52% undervalued at its present price of £24.35. Therefore, a fair value per share would be £50.73. Nothing is certain in financial markets, of course, but this underlines to me that it looks a huge bargain currently. Will I buy more? British American Tobacco ticks all three boxes I require to invest in a stock. First, it has a very high yield that gives me a regular stream of sizeable dividend payments. Second, it looks extremely undervalued against its peer group’s shares. And third, its core business looks solid and set for ongoing growth. These are the reasons why I thought the stock was unmissable when I first bought it a while ago. And they remain the reasons why I will be adding to this holding very shortly."},

Oil price outlook Clearly then, many  FTSE 100  investors appear to regard the company simply as an oil price play. So for them, a bullish oil market outlook may well prompt further buying of Shell shares, pushing the price up. I think this is entirely possible. Early June saw OPEC+ extend its 3.66m barrels per day (bpd) of production cuts to the end of 2025. The oil cartel will extend another 2.2m bpd to the end of September 2024. Demand is also set to increase from the world’s largest oil importer, China. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that its oil consumption will rise by 510,000 bpd this year. Reductions in supply while demand is increasing are generally supportive of the oil price. A risk for Shell shares is that this demand-supply imbalance reverses sooner rather than later. Another is any government pressure to speed up its energy transition. This would result in lost revenues from a still-strong oil and gas market. Relative valuation play ? Although part of Shell’s share price is related to the oil price, I think other elements should be factored into it. One is the valuation discrepancy between Shell and its international peers. More specifically, the UK firm trades on the key  price-to-earnings  (P/E) stock valuation measurement at 12.6. This is cheap compared to the average P/E of its peer group, which is 14. To ascertain how cheap, I ran a  discounted cash flow  analysis using several other analysts’ figures and my own. This shows Shell shares to be around 17% undervalued at their present price of £28.35. Therefore, a fair value would be around £34.16. This does not necessarily mean they will ever reach that price. However, it underlines to me how cheap they look compared to their peers. Increasing shareholder rewards Presumably to help close this valuation gap, Shell increased its dividend reward for shareholders recently. Q1 saw it rise a whopping 19.7% to 34.4 cents (27p) from the previous 28.75 cents. If this rate were applied to the entire 2023 payout of $1.2935, then 2024’s dividend would be $1.5483 (£1.22). On the current share price of £28.35, this would give a yield of 4.3%. This compares very favourably to the present average  FTSE 100  yield of 3.6%. On 2 May, Shell also announced the start of a $3.5bn share buyback programme due to end on 1 August. Buybacks are generally supportive of a company’s share price. Will I buy more? Both these initiatives came after the firm announced Q1 adjusted earnings of $7.7bn — way ahead of consensus analysts’ expectations of $6.5bn. The forecasts now are for Shell’s earnings to grow at 5.6% a year to the end of 2027. Earnings per share are expected to jump by 9.3% a year to that point. And return on equity is projected to be 12.6% by then. These should power increases in both dividends and the share price into the future. Consequently, I will be adding to my holding in Shell shares at the earliest opportunity."},

Yet, even with this impressive rally, the stock is still trading firmly below pre-pandemic levels. And that’s despite delivering massively improved earnings. So, are these cheap shares worth buying today? Capitalising on interest rates On the profit side of the equation, Lloyds is smashing it. The FTSE 100 bank set a new record for pre-tax profits in 2023 which surged by 57% year-on-year reaching £7.5bn. There are a lot of moving parts behind this boosted performance. But it’s no secret that higher interest rates have been a boon. As such, management hiked dividends from 2.4p to 2.76p and launched a new £2bn share buyback scheme. A looming concern is the threat of interest rate cuts from the Bank of England. After all, now that inflation is almost in line with the central bank’s target, the gravy train may soon come to an end. Yet this concern may be unfounded. Higher interest rates are great for bank profits so long as borrowers can keep making payments. And there are some trouble economic trends that suggest this is getting quite difficult. For example, private business bankruptcies in the UK have skyrocketed, and the number of late payments on mortgages is also climbing. Left unchecked, these trends could prove to be a massive problem for Lloyds as its loan book transforms from an asset into a liability. That’s why interest rate cuts may prove advantageous. The bank’s net interest margin may suffer. But loan affordability will improve, reducing the risk of default from existing customers while also attracting new ones. With that in mind, these shares certainly sound interesting, especially at a  price-to-earnings ratio  of just 7.4. So, what’s the catch? What’s the problem? Like most banking institutions, Lloyds has had its fair share of scandals. And the company may be in the middle of another one today. Regulators are investigating the group for foul play in the car financing space, which Lloyds has already set aside £450m to settle claims. However, regulatory probes aren’t the only thing holding Lloyds shares back. The business generates almost all of its revenue from within the UK. As such, it’s highly sensitive to Britain’s economy. In the short term, this is proving advantageous. But in the long run, it’s a bit of a headwind. Even before Covid-19 and inflation came along, Britain has struggled to eke out meaningful growth. And it’s a trend that may be set to continue even after inflation leaves the headlines. At least that’s what KPMG’s forecasts currently suggest, with a whopping 1% growth estimate by the end of this decade. Therefore, this FTSE 100 stock may be priced cheaply for good reason. And given there are other more promising enterprises in the  financial space , it’s not a stock I’m interested in buying today."},

After all, the more a company pays out to shareholders, the greater the passive income earned from a portfolio. And luckily for British investors, the UK’s flagship index is home to a wide range of these enterprises. Even after enjoying a double-digit rally this year, the  FTSE 100  still has plenty of constituents offering chunky yields. So let’s take a closer look at some of the biggest on offer right now. Biggest dividend yields Company Industry Dividend Yield Phoenix Group Life Insurance 10.2% M&G Investment Banking & Brokerage Services 9.6% British American Tobacco Tobacco 9.4% Legal & General Life Insurance 8.9% Imperial Brands Tobacco 7.3% HSBC Holdings Banking 7.0% Aviva Life Insurance 7.0% Taylor Wimpey House Construction 6.7% Rio Tinto  ( LSE:RIO ) Metals & Mining 6.5% Land Securities Group Real Estate 6.5% Combined, this collection of dividend shares payout an average of 7.9% in terms of yield. That’s more than double the 3.6% currently offered by the FTSE 100 as a whole. And in terms of money, £10,000 equally invested across all stocks translates into a passive income of £790 versus £360 a year. Of course, this income could be boosted by concentrating capital into the higher-yielding enterprises. If all this money were allocated solely to Phoenix Group, then investors would earn £1,020 instead. Pairing that with a bit of capital gains leads to some chunky overall returns in the long run. Unfortunately, like most things in life, investing isn’t that straightforward. Yields don’t always go up Companies are often keen to maintain shareholder payouts wherever possible. Expanding shareholder rewards is a powerful signalling tool that helps improve investor sentiment, which is critical when looking to raise capital. However, these payments are also completely optional. That’s why when business turns sour, like in 2020, dividends often get put on the chopping block. In these scenarios, a once chunky yield can be massively slashed. And that’s precisely what’s recently happened with Rio Tinto. Despite still being in the top 10, the mining giant’s yield used to be twice as large around six months ago. Inflation  paired with global supply chain disruptions saw prices of iron, aluminium, and copper skyrocket in 2021 and 2022. And the group’s bottom line unsurprisingly followed suit generating record profits, a large chunk of which was returned to shareholders through dividends. But since then, commodity prices have cooled. Iron ore prices, in particular, have suffered this year, tumbling from around £114 per tonne to £84 – a 26% drop. And since iron’s one of Rio’s primary products, the group’s  earnings  have crashed back down to Earth resulting in a massive dividend cut for shareholders. The bottom line Rio Tinto’s long-term outlook is far from compromised. Management has been steadily diversifying the group’s product portfolio, and its progress into decarbonising the steel industry could yield solid advantages over the next decade. However, market cycles can take years to turn around. And investors may be waiting a while before the yield returns to double-digit territory. All of this is to say when exploring high-yield investment opportunities, investors must carefully consider the sustainability of the underlying earnings that ultimately fund them."},

Diageo’s shares continue to slide and now I’m wondering whether to average down by adding a second splash of the  FTSE 100  spirits giant to my SIPP. Markets had been shocked by a slump in spirits sales in its key Latin American and Caribbean market, which contributes around 11% of total company earnings. Diageo had spent years repositioning itself as a premium drinks brand, but locals were trading down as they had less money in their pockets. Local inventory problems made things worse. FTSE 100 shock I like buying top quality blue-chips on bad news. It allows me to grab their shares at a discounted price, and secure a higher starting yield too. Then I  sit back and wait for them to recover . There’s a problem though. What if they don’t recover? Diageo has now fallen 20% since November’s shock profit warning, from 3,245p to 2,585p. Over one year, Diageo shares are down 21.65%. In fact, it’s worse than that. The shares have lost a third of their value since peaking at 4,016p on 31 December 2021. This is more than a blip. And still they slide. My underlying concern with Diageo is that alcohol may lose its social dominance. Gen Z is boozing less. Health campaigns may be having an effect. People are aware of the damage it can do. That would be a huge social change, and I don’t think we’re there yet. But it’s something to watch out for. In the short term, the inflation shock has made people feel poorer, and not just in the UK. The US economy is now slowing and while inflation is easing off, everything costs 20% more than it did just a few years ago. Diageo also operates in China, which has troubles of its own. There’s a risk it could get caught up in trade wars with the US and EU. Top growth stock Diageo now trades at 17.5 times earnings. That’s notably higher than the FTSE 100 average of 12.5 times, but a massive drop from its average valuation over the last decade, when the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was routinely between 22 and 24 times. Let’s see what the chart says. Chart by TradingView I’m ignoring that pandemic spike, when lockdown fuelled a global cocktail binge. Today’s P/E is close to a 10-year low. I’m sorely tempted to average down on my stake, despite the evident risks. It still sells more than 200 brands in nearly 180 countries, including big names such as J ohnnie Walker, Tanqueray, Baileys, Smirnoff  and  Guinness.  I tried  Guinness  0,0 the other day. It was shockingly good. Maybe there is life after alcohol. I’m willing to bet that the world will keep drinking, and plan to buy more in July. It could be a few years before my bet pays off, but at some point I feel investor tastes will change. I may be wrong, but if they do, I’ll be glad I bought Diageo when it was cheap. I might even treat myself to a drink."},

But looking back at the past five years, I think I’m seeing an underperformance, and I reckon there could be a lot more still to come. Lagging the Nasdaq The high-profile stars held by this  investment trust  include some of the biggest winners on the  Nasdaq  tech stock index. From a baseline in mid-2019, the Scottish Mortgage share price climbed 190% by the time of its October 2021 peak. And that was almost twice the Nasdaq’s gain in the same period. The two then fell and were almost completely back in line for most of 2022. But since then,  tech stocks  have been heading up again. But this time round, it’s the Nasdaq that’s pulled ahead. It’s now up 123% over the full five years, close to twice the Scottish Mortgage growth of 68%. Catch-up time? Does that mean the trust’s undervalued compared to the Nasdaq? In itself, no. But it’s one thing that adds to the total. The discount to net asset value (NAV) is another. Currently at 9%, that means we can buy a pound’s worth of underlying assets for 91p. The discount has been higher, up around 20%. But the trust traded at a premium back in 2021, costing 4% more than the stocks it held. I don’t expect to see a premium again any time soon. But the share price and the NAV are converging, and I think the discount could shrink more. New growth phase? In general, investors tend to pull back to safer stocks during hard times and cash is tight. Just like the last few years, with the pandemic and then high inflation and interest rates. And when things lighten up, we’re more open to a bit more risk and start to eye up  growth stocks  again. Now, I would never suggest trying to time a strategy. Safety, income, growth… depending on market conditions. No, I’ve always thought we need to choose our strategy carefully, and stick with what we know. But for those with a long-term growth plan, I feel we could be in a buying opportunity here. Want some of these? It’s all down to whether we want to own a bit of  Tesla . Or  Moderna , or  Amazon.com . Or, what’s that one that’s been in the news a bit lately? That’s it,  Nvidia , now valued at more than $3trn. I don’t want to put much money onto any one of those individually. Or, in fact, any of the many other tech and growth stocks held by Scottish Mortgage. Any one of them could crash spectacularly, and I don’t want to be left standing in the ruins. Spread the risk But a little bit of cash in each one, spread across other global growth stocks too, with a whole lot of diversification? I might go for that. I still expect Scottish Mortgage to suffer more falls in the years to come. But for those who see a long-term future for the stocks it holds, it has to be worth considering, doesn’t it?"},

Me too. But for the sake of Rolls-Royce shareholders, I’m glad I’ve been wrong… so far, at least. Still, looking at the share price chart, that 450%+ rise of the past two years does make me nervous. And that’s even when I don’t own the shares. Interest rates It might sound strange to suggest that cuts in interest rates could send the Rolls-Royce share price down. But I think it could happen, even if it’s only an indirect trigger. Cuts could make a lot of today’s  FTSE 100  dividend stocks look cheap. Well, they look cheap to me already — some of them dirt cheap. But high interest rates make returns from cash (in a Cash ISA, for example) and bonds look good. And for investors who want to keep their risk down, that can make a lot of sense. I can see a lot of that cash moving to dividend stocks once rates reverse though. And we might see cash moved from higher-risk  growth stocks  to income shares if they start to rise. Earnings miss Forecasts  look good for Roll-Royce earnings and, so far, it hasn’t disappointed. In its most recent trading update, Rolls told us that things are going well. The firm said: “ Our full year 2024 guidance is unchanged, with a broadly balanced weighting for both profit and cash flow across the year “. Forecasts show earnings per share (EPS) resetting this year, and then growing. Analysts predict a 20% climb in 2025, and another 17% the next year. There are targets for all sorts of other measures too. They might all be reasonable for a resurging Rolls-Royce. But what happens if the figures don’t quite meet one of these? Or Rolls lowers its quidance some time? By even a little bit? For growth stock investors, that’s often time to go look for the next big thing. Next big thing Talking of that, the world seems to be going mad for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, even anything remotely connected. Nvidia ‘s surged to a $3trn valuation, briefly becoming the world’s most valuable company. It’s up nearly 3,000% in five years. Here in the UK, our very own  Raspberry Pi Holdings  is off to a decent start since IPO, around 40% up on its initial offer price. That holds promise for the AI and robotics world. It’s early days, but I give it a good chance of turning into the next big UK growth stock. Dump Rolls-Royce? Now, none of these things might upset the Rolls-Royce share price. Or maybe one or two of them could cause a slight wobble — like I thought profit-taking was set to do in early 2024. The Rolls-Royce stock valuation does looks a bit high, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31. But it could drop to 22 on 2026 forecasts. That might be just fine. And the Rolls-Royce share price train might keep powering along."},

Some of the dividend yields out there look very attractive right now, especially on income-focused  investment trusts . Here are two from the  FTSE 250  I’m keen to add to my Stocks and Shares ISA once I’ve freed up some money. A bright future  The first is  NextEnergy Solar Fund  ( LSE: NESF ), which has 103 solar and energy storage assets in its portfolio. These are enough to power the equivalent of 301,000 homes for one year.  The stock’s fallen 14.5% so far in 2024, as higher interest rates continue to hammer the whole renewable energy sector. Around a third of NextEnergy’s debt isn’t fixed, so higher rates continue to present challenges here. They remain at a 16-year high of 5.25%. However, I’m encouraged that the fund is actively trying to bring down its debt. It’s offloaded two assets in recent months, the latest being a 35.2MW solar farm sold at a 14% premium to its March holding value. Another three locations are up for sale. I think there’s a strong chance the share price will bounce back once the Bank of England starts lowering rates. Of course, we don’t know when that’ll be, but the first drop in borrowing costs for more than four years could be on the cards for August. In the meantime, the stock’s offering a titanic 10.6% dividend yield covered by cash coming in. So I could invest £5,000 today and receive £5,300 in passive income over the next 10 years. This assumes the payout’s maintained, which is never guaranteed with dividend stocks. Still, NextEnergy did recently raise its dividend for the 11th straight year. And I reckon its future looks bright, despite what the current share price suggests. Mining for dividends  Another I really like is  BlackRock World Mining Trust  ( LSE: BRWM ). As the name suggests, this focuses on global mining stocks. It’s one I’ve held for a few years, but I’m due a top-up.  The biggest holdings today include  Glencore ,  BHP Group  and  Rio Tinto . These are among the world’s largest mining firms and all regularly dish out dividends. The trust collects these and distributes income to its own shareholders.   Currently, the dividend yield’s 5.9%, comfortably above the 3.5% average for a UK stock. One unavoidable risk in this sector is that supply and demand fluctuates, significantly impacting earnings and dividends. What happens in China, a major producer and consumer of commodities, is often key. Obviously, the mining sector also has a reputation for its poor environmental record. While I’d never try to defend or minimise this, it’s also a fact that there won’t be a green revolution without loads more mining.   Take copper, for example. It’s the workhorse of the energy transition due to its excellent conductivity. It’s vital for wind turbine wiring, solar panels, and electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. Some estimates suggest a potential increase of 45% in demand for copper by 2030 compared to 2023. In fact, demand’s tipped to outpace supply increases, which could support higher profits, dividends and share prices for copper miners. This FTSE 250 trust’s positioned to benefit from this trend."},

All of them had a tough June, their shares falling between 8% and 15%. This looks like a buying opportunity to me. Luxury goods brand  Burberry Group  ( LSE: BRBY ) was the second-worst performer on the entire  FTSE 100  in June, crashing 15.11%. Only  B&M European Value Retail  did worse, down 18.83%. Burberry has had a rotten year too. Over 12 months, it’s down a thumping 58.94%. Today’s economic uncertainty, especially in China, slammed profits after tax, which plunged from £492m in 2022 to £271m in 2023. Bargain blue-chips Fashion is by its nature  cyclical  and Burberry has fallen out of style lately, while its marketing efforts have repeatedly misfired. The luxury market is supposed to be recession-proof because the super-rich can afford to carry on spending, but Burberry hasn’t quite cracked the ultra-high-end of the market. I bought its shares twice in May, hoping to take advantage of its troubles, but jumped in too soon. I’m down a brutal 23.33%. I hope to trim that loss by averaging down on Burberry shares in July. Trading at 12.25 times earnings – half their former valuation – and yielding a bumper 6.16%, they look like a buy for me. I think Burberry should bounce back,  but it will take time . I’m also thinking of topping up my stake in struggling pharmaceuticals group  GSK  ( LSE: GSK ). I bought the stock in March because I thought it looked ripe for a recovery after years of underperformance against soaraway rival  AstraZeneca . I then averaged down in June when the shares fell 10% on fears of litigation over its  Zantac  treatment. Now I’m wondering whether to have a third bite, with the stock falling another 4.06% last week alone. The culprit this time was a US health agency ruling that restricted the market for its  Arexvy  product. Overall, the stock is down 9.06% over the last year. I think the market has overreacted. The shares look tempting priced at just 9.84 times earnings, with a solid yield of 3.79%. GSK should get there in the end. I see bumps along the road as buying opportunities, and don’t plan to waste this one. Another LSE opportunity I’ve been itching to buy private equity specialist  Intermediate Capital Group  ( LSE: ICG ) for two years, now. So what held me back? Its rocketing share price. I felt like I had missed out on the momentum. That’s less of a worry today, with the share price down 8.86% in the last month. However, it’s still up 59.33% over 12 months. It shows just how well the company has been doing, with group profits up 132% to £258.1m in 2023. Performance fee income soared 276% to £73.7m. I expected the stock to be super-expensive as a result, but instead it’s trading at a modest 13.48 times earnings. That reduces the fear that I’m overpaying. Private equity can be risky. If interest rates stay higher for longer, Intermediate Capital Group could struggle to match last year’s share price surge. This is a volatile sector, but recent slippage could be my chance. I’m keen to buy all three cut-price stocks. It’s time for a summer spree."},

This is a decline of 10% or more in a share price from its most recent peak. Normally, that wouldn’t be newsworthy material given that stocks ‘correct’ all the time. But in the case of Nvidia, due to its sheer size, its 13% dip equated to more than $500bn being shaved off its market value at one point in June. That’s the market cap equivalent of three  HSBC s and a  Tesco ! Would this have been enough to wipe out gains for an investment made at the start of June? Rising even higher  Amazingly, no. The share price started the month at a  split -adjusted price of $109. As I write, it’s on course to end it at $124, representing a very respectable gain of 13.75%. So, five grand invested around four weeks ago would now be worth £5,685 on paper. And the much-hyped correction? Well, that just put the stock back where it was in mid-June. In other words, the recent pullback claimed approximately two weeks’ worth of gains. Nvidia stock is still up about 26,280% in a decade. So this drop was brief and insignificant in the grand scheme of things. Warren Buffett  says, “ If you aren’t thinking about owning a stock for ten years, don’t even think about owning it for ten minutes .” Nvidia demonstrates why.  Mind-blowing margins  ChatGPT was released in November 2022, kicking off a tidal wave of spending on Nvidia’s graphics processing unit (GPUs). A significant portion of this has been from deep-pocketed cloud platforms like  Amazon  Web Services (AWS),  Microsoft  Azure, and Google Cloud. They’re investing massive sums to handle the increasing demand for cloud-based, AI-driven applications, which rely on the powerful processing capabilities of GPUs. This huge demand has shown up dramatically in Nvidia’s financial statements. Revenue and profits have absolutely skyrocketed, demolishing Wall Street’s already lofty expectations along the way.  One metric that stands out to me is the incredible expansion in the company’s gross margin as demand has taken off. This rose above 72% in FY24! \n Created at  TradingView As a reminder, gross margin is the percentage of revenue remaining after deducting the cost of goods sold. This figure not only highlights that costs are under control but also showcases Nvidia’s pricing power. Companies are paying top dollar to get their hands on these golden GPUs. Competition is coming However, we know this won’t always be the case, at least not on this scale. Supply will catch up with demand and Nvidia’s red-hot rate of growth will cool dramatically.  Moreover, large cloud providers (its biggest customers) are increasingly designing their own AI chips to reduce reliance on Nvidia. Though I expect the company will remain a major player, this is likely to create a trickier competitive landscape moving forward.  AI bubble? We’ll only know with the benefit of hindsight whether we’re in an AI bubble right now. If we are, then I’d expect a massive fall in Nvidia stock over the next few years as the bubble deflates or even pops.  Right now, I’d rather get Nvidia exposure through tech-focused investment trusts or simply invest in cheaper AI-related stocks. There are plenty to choose from."},

And for  Topps Tiles  ( LSE: TPT ), that’s exactly what’s happened. The company sells tiles and flooring products, and I’ve been watching its performance for years. The last decade has been painful, and the shares have lost close to two thirds of their value. The pandemic didn’t help. Nor did the soaring inflation and interest rates that followed. When people are struggling to pay their mortgages, there’s not much cash left for spiffing up the kitchen floor, or whatever. A better decade? Trading in the first half of 2024 was tough, with earnings per share dropping by more than a third after revenue fell 6%. But Topps had net cash of £19.3m, so it’s not under threat from debt. Forecasts  show earnings growth back on track in 2025, with the  price-to-earnings  (P/E) ratio dropping to only eight by 2026. These are definitely risky times to buy such a consumer-dependent  penny stock . But I reckon the next decade could be a lot better, and I might buy a few shares. In the same boat The other one I’m looking at has suffered for much the same reason. It’s  Michelmersh Brick Holdings  ( LSE: MBH ), and the construction slump has taken its toll. At least, it’s scared investors away, with the share price way down from its 2021 peak. Results for the 2023 full year though beat expectations. On an adjusted basis,  EBITDA  rose by 6.6%. Chairman Martin Warner, spoke of “ another positive year for the group, with strong growth across our key financial metrics despite the decline in the broader construction industry. “ More cash Again, we’re looking at a company with net cash on the books. It’s £11m in this case, up a bit from £10.6m. At this point in the economy, with May inflation down to 2% and interest rate cuts anticipated, I think the period of peak risk has passed. There still is risk from the construction industry, which could continue to suffer even after rates fall. And penny stock volatility could add to it. But again, forecasts for rising earnings and a falling P/E puts this one on my list of possible buys too. Dividends I nearly forgot… both of these penny stocks pay good dividends. At Michelmersh, there’s a 4.7% yield on the cards. The company raised its 2023 dividend 6%, so I’m upbeat about this year’s. And back at Topps Tiles, the forecast is for a whopping 8.7%. In this case, the H1 dividend was kept flat. Sentiment How well these two do in the next few years could, I think, depend a lot on market sentiment. And money coming back into the stock market and away from cash as interest rates drop could mostly go to low-risk big caps. The mood for penny stocks could stay cool for a while. But I reckon those focused on the next decade should consider these two."},

For investors who bought the stock 30 years ago, that’s an annual return of around 18%.  I’d have been too young to buy the stock back in 1994. But I have a two-year-old and I can make investments now that can generate passive income for him in the future.  The  dividend yield  for investors buying the stock today is 3.2%. But Diageo has increased its distributions every year for the last 37 years and I think it can keep going for a long time yet. Risks Diageo’s brand portfolio has leading products in several categories. On top of this, its scale is unmatched, making it extremely difficult for smaller competitors to disrupt its business. There are however, risks for investors to consider. And the biggest is probably consumers switching to cheaper alternatives.  Over the last 30 years, wage increases haven’t been keeping pace with inflation. As a result, household budgets are under more pressure than they have been. Despite its unmatched strength, Diageo’s brand portfolio’s firmly tilted towards the premium end of the market. This increases the risk of consumers trading down. A Dividend Aristocrat Despite the risks, I think Diageo can create generational passive income for investors. The company has grown its dividend through the Great Financial Crisis, Brexit, and Covid-19. Through any 30-year period, there are challenges for businesses. But the best ones are able to keep moving forward even when things are difficult.  Diageo has done this as well as anyone. Its success hasn’t just been due to falling interest rates and low inflation – the company’s distinctive strengths have proved durable. I think this means there’s more to come in terms of dividen growth. And with the stock at a 52-week low and the dividend yield at its highest for a decade, I’m looking to buy it.  Payout growth The last 10 years haven’t exactly been easy for Diageo – or businesses in general. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, the company’s increased its dividend by an average of 4.7% a year. If this continues, the dividend per share will reach £2.93 in 2054 – a 12% return at today’s prices. And that will be something worthwhile for the next generation."},

A lot of people do not start investing because they want to save more money first. I understand that logic, but procrastination can mean never getting started. On top of that, a lot of stock market beginners make some rookie errors. If I had never bought shares before, I would rather start investing by dipping my toe in the water than making a big splash.  Yes, that might not make me rich (yet) – but it could also mean that any beginner’s mistakes I made were less costly. So if I had £380 and wanted to start buying shares for the first time, here is what I would do. Getting ready to invest In some ways, making the first move is the simple bit. I would get the administrative side of things in order to be ready to start investing. So for example, I would set up a  share-dealing account  or  Stocks and Shares ISA  then put my £380 into it. After that, I would learn about how the stock market works. A great business is not always a great investment. I would want to start investing as I hoped to go on, by making great investments. Finding shares to buy It might seem that £380 might not buy me many shares. But putting all my eggs in one basket can be risky. So even with a modest sum, I would want to diversify across a number of different shares. That is possible even with just a few hundred pounds, though I would be mindful of the dealing costs if I put it into an array of different shares. One option to try and spread my risk without buying lots of different shares would be to invest in a share like  City of London Investment Trust  ( LSE: CTY ). An  investment trust  is basically a form of pooled investment. So City of London owns shares in dozens of companies and by owning its shares I could indirectly gain exposure to them. If things go well and fund managers make strong investment choices, the trust’s pool of mostly British blue-chip shares could hopefully do well. On top of that, the trust pays a dividend. It has raised that dividend every year for over half a century although, as always in the stock market, past performance is not necessarily a guide to what will happen in future. Sluggish UK economy With the UK economy looking sluggish though, I see a risk that ongoing weakness could mean City of London’s share price does not even grow in line with inflation. In the past few years its track record has been modest. Still, if I had spare cash to invest, I would consider buying the shares. An alternative would be to start investing in individual shares. Even against a lacklustre economic backdrop, some companies will likely do well. Buying them while investors’ expectations are muted could potentially mean I bag a long-term bargain, if I choose the right shares."},

Here’s how I’d aim to turn that into a £100 monthly passive income", "title_link": "https://www.fool.co.uk/2024/06/30/4000-to-invest-heres-how-id-aim-to-turn-that-into-a-100-monthly-passive-income/", "published_date": "30 June, 2024", "publisher_name": "Harvey Jones", "Description": "I buy  FTSE 100  dividend shares to generate a passive income to top up my State Pension when I retire. Whenever I have a bit of cash to spare, I invest it in blue-chip UK stocks. I’ve been doing it for years. My only regret is I didn’t start even earlier. Luckily, investing in shares doesn’t require a huge sum of money upfront. It’s possible to get cracking with as little as £500, or even less for a newbie investor who wants to get the hang of how it works. Buying individual company stocks is riskier than simply putting money into a savings account. Yet in the longer run, it should be more rewarding. Chasing dividends for life Investors don’t just make money when share prices rise. Many companies pay regular dividends on top, as a reward for holding their stock. Better still, most aim to increase these dividends, year after year, as profits increase. This gives investors a potential rising income, although there are no guarantees. FTSE 100 companies who increase or maintain dividends for at least seven consecutive years are known as  Dividend Aristocrats . FTSE 100 information and analytics firm  RELX  ( LSE: REL ) is one of them. It has hiked shareholder payout for each of the last 13 years. The RELX share price has had a brilliant run too. It’s up 39.43% over the last year and 90.57% over five years. That’s pretty impressive but anyone who reinvested all their dividends straight back into RELX shares will have done even better. The trailing yield is a modest 1.62% but that’s misleading. Yields are calculated by dividing a company’s dividend per share by its share price. So when the share price rises – and RELX has risen an awful lot – the yield automatically falls. Rising payouts In practice, RELX has increased its dividend at an average compound rate of 9.1% a year for a decade, according to figures from  AJ Bell . In that time, it has delivered a stonking total return of 397.1%. Better still, it’s forecast to increase its dividend per share by 7.4% in 2024 and 7.9% in 2025. After their strong run, RELX shares look expensive trading at 32.05 times earnings. If profits slow or slip, the stock could come crashing down. It’s a risk with any share. That’s why I invest in a spread of around 20 income-paying stocks, with different profiles. When one underperforms, others will hopefully compensate. The long-term average total return on the FTSE 100 is 7% a year (although I hope to beat that). If I invested £4,000 today that would give me £30,448 after 30 years. Not bad from an initial £4k stake If I took 4% of that each year, known as the safe withdrawal rate, I’d generate a second income of £1,218 a year. That’s just over £100 a month. Many of my portfolio holdings yield 7% or more, which would give me an even higher income.  Of course I wouldn’t stop at investing £4,000.  By investing year after year , I’d hope my passive income ultimately hits tens of thousands a year."},

Given that a barrel of Brent crude now costs $83 — compared to $95 in September 2023 — this doesn’t surprise me. That’s because although the energy giant doesn’t just sell oil, the price of ‘black gold’ has a big influence on its financial performance. The table below shows the average cost of Brent crude, as well as the net cash generated by BP from its operations, from 2018 to 2023. From a statistical point of view, these two variables have a correlation coefficient of 0.97. This means they are 97% matched. Year Brent Crude  ($ per barrel) Net cash generated from operating activities  ($bn) Share price at 31 December  (pence) 2018 71.2 22.9 496 2019 64.3 25.8 472 2020 41.7 12.2 255 2021 70.9 23.6 331 2022 100.9 40.9 475 2023 82.4 32.0 466 Source: US Energy Information Administration / company accounts Statisticians will caution that correlation doesn’t necessarily imply causation. But in this case I think it’s reasonable to assume that oil prices do impact on BP’s cash flow. And there’s a 70% relationship between the price of oil and BP’s share price. Although less strong, this does show how investor sentiment towards the company changes in response to movements in energy prices. Looking ahead Despite the global move towards net zero, demand for oil’s still rising. According to the International Energy Agency, this is expected to peak in 2029 and fall thereafter. In theory, this should bode well for the BP share price over the next five years. But it’s virtually impossible to accurately predict future oil prices. There are so many factors involved that some academic studies have found that assuming tomorrow’s price will be the same as today’s, is more accurate than some more sophisticated forecasts. And then there’s the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). This cartel adjusts production to maintain the price of oil at a level that is acceptable to its members. It never publicly gives a target price but achieving a figure of close to $90 a barrel is often believed to be its objective. Incidentally, OPEC believes the demand for oil will continue to rise long after 2029. As a result of numerous economic, political and geographical influences, oil is often found to be one of the most volatile commodities around. What does this all mean? This tells me that I’d be silly trying to predict where the BP share price will be in five years time. And because of this enormous level of uncertainty, I’d need a large  dividend  to compensate for the risk of holding a stake in the company. For each of the last four quarters, the company has paid a dividend of 7.27 cents a share. At current exchange rates, this equates to an annual payout of 23.01p. Based on the company’s current share price, this implies a yield of 4.8%. Although this is comfortably above the  FTSE 100  average of 3.8%, I don’t want to own a stake in the company. There are other higher-yielding stocks around that don’t carry the same level of risk. To sum up, I have no idea where the BP share price will be in 2029. Of course, I can’t accurately predict other stock prices either. But trends in non-oil markets are easier to spot. And BP’s financial performance is so reliant on the price of oil — a commodity whose price is notoriously difficult to forecast — that I’d rather invest my money elsewhere."},

It fell 1.2% in June, yet year to date it’s up 16.3%. If I’d invested in Lloyds instead of the  FTSE 100 , I’d be a happy investor. In 2024, the Footsie has climbed ‘just’ 5.4%. But what could July have in store for the stock? Lloyds currently trades for 54.7p a share. Could we see it break the 60p barrier this month? A volatile month ahead To reach that milestone, that would mean its share price would have to rise a further 9.7%. That’s not impossible. But it’s incredibly unlikely. That’s because we’re set for a potentially  volatile  month. We have the election coming up in the next few days (4 July). All major political polls have the Labour party as the front-runner to win. Nonetheless, a shock result could see the markets throw a tantrum.  That said, one positive is that both the Labour party and the Conservatives have laid out policies that look set to benefit banks, which could provide Lloyds with a boost.  However, there are other factors. For one, while inflation has fallen to the government’s 2% target, it remains a threat. What’s more, there’s also the Bank of England’s actions around interest rate cuts to consider. It seems the market is pricing in the first cut to come in August. That said, any signs of a delay would dent investor confidence and market sentiment. Cheap as chips But here at  The Motley Fool , we don’t buy shares with only the short term in mind. I like to look past that. After all, the market has proved time and time again the best way to reap its rewards is to invest for the long term. By that, I mean at least five years. Ideally, it would be much longer. So, do I see long-term value in Lloyds at its current price? Yes. Its shares look cheap. They trade on just 7.5 times earnings. That’s way below the Footsie average of 11. Its price-to-book ratio is just 0.7, where 1 is considered fair value. Its cheap share price also means a higher  dividend yield . Today, the stock yields 5%. Again, that’s above the average of its Footsie peers (3.6%). UK focus There are a few other risks I see with Lloyds aside from short-term volatility. For example, it generates all of its revenues from the UK. I own shares in Footsie competitor  HSBC  given its diversification and investment in regions like Asia. Lloyds doesn’t offer this. One for the future But even so, I’m bullish on the UK bank. Lloyds may not reach 60p this month, but I’ll be holding on to the shares I own. I’m confident in the years to come we could see it surpass the 60p mark. Analysts have a 12-month price target for the stock of 59.4p. With it looking like great value for money, I think now could be a smart time to consider buying some shares in the Footsie banking stalwart."},

But is £1k a year too much of a stretch when investing £10,000? After all, a stock would need to yield 10% to produce that, and not many companies can. In fairness, I wouldn’t expect to get that much immediately. However, it may be close. Big dividends and volatility For example, well-known and popular dividend payer  Legal & General  ( LSE: LGEN ) has a share price near 228p (26 June). At that level, the forward-looking dividend yield for 2025 is just over 9.6%. Putting all the money in the stock would generate a total annual dividend worth about £960. However, the  trading costs  would eat into that return a little in the first year, but not much. Why is Legal & General’s dividend yield so high though? In one rule of thumb often used by investors, any yield above 7% might be signalling risks as well as opportunity. Perhaps the biggest uncertainty is the company operates in the financial sector, which is known for its cyclicality and volatility. Cyclical firms often see their profits wax and wane as the general economy goes through its usual boom and bust gyrations. That’s why the company’s valuation always seems to look so low and attractive – and the dividend yield so high. It’s the stock market’s way of pricing in the possibility of a collapse in earnings, cash flow, dividends and the share price ahead. To be honest, I expect the market will be correct one day. However, that wouldn’t put me off investing in the stock now. Although cyclicality’s a big ongoing risk that may cause me to lose money on the stock. I reckon we may be in the early stages of an enduring period of multi-year prosperity for the economy, individuals, businesses and companies. So to me, Legal and General looks like a decent stock to research and consider right now, despite the risks. Aiming to manage the uncertainties That said, there’s no way all my eggs would go in the one basket. £10,000 doesn’t come available to me every day, so I’d aim to be careful with it by embracing the stock-pickers friend – diversification. In other words, I’d spread the investment over several stocks with attractive-looking dividend prospects. For example, my watchlist includes names such as energy company  National Grid  and supermarket chain  J Sainsbury . I like them, but it’s worth me remembering all businesses and stocks come with risks as well as opportunity. Therefore, my plan would be to dig in with thorough research before buying in an effort to try to reduce the effect of some of the worst investment howlers I could make! Finally, I’d play the  long game  with my investing. The process of compounding is one of the main factors that could help to build the value of my portfolio’s dividend income.  So I’d reinvest dividends along the way so the dividend stream hopefully expands over time. That would be my plan for getting to an annual second income of £1,000 from an initial investment of £10k."},

And I think there’s more excitement to come. Lloyds shares flatlined for years after the 2008 financial crisis as the traumatised banking sector tried to piece itself together. There was the odd share price spike in that time, but it never led anywhere. The pain lasted too long. Lloyds had started paying dividends again. The yield had crept past 5%. The company was making billions. Its shares were dirt cheap, trading as low as five or six times earnings. Yet investors didn’t want to know. FTSE 100 recovery stock Eventually, I decided this couldn’t go on and bought the shares last year. I’m happy I did. The share price is up 28.35% over the last 12 months. With dividends on top, the total return is heading towards 35%. And I think this is only the start. I thought Lloyds shares would rally hard when central bankers finally started cutting interest rates, but that hasn’t happened yet. This means investors can still get yields of up to 5% from cash and bonds, while taking little or no risks with their capital. This makes  dividend stocks  look a little less tempting, because the risks are higher. When central bankers such as the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England finally decide they’ve licked inflation, they’ll start slashing interest rates. At that point, yields on cash and bonds will fall. Yet the Lloyds yield won’t. Quite the reverse. Today, Lloyds shares have a trailing yield of 5.04%. That’s forecast to hit 5.37% in 2024 and 5.9% in 2025. At that point, savings rates and bond yields could be heading towards 3%. Great for dividend income When that happens, money should rotate into stocks like Lloyds. And the share price should rise, if I’m right. As ever when investing, there are no guarantees. Falling interest rates won’t be all good news. This will squeeze Lloyds’ net interest margins, the difference between what it charges borrowers and pays savers. That’s a key measure of company profitability, and it’s already started to narrow. Yet lower rates will be good news for the banks in other ways, reducing debt impairments, reviving the housing market and putting money into people’s pockets. Plus the UK economy  is growing faster than expected  too. There are other risks. We still don’t know how the motor finance mis-selling scandal will plan out. Lloyds has set aside £450m to cover compensation costs. It could be on the hook for much more.  Yet with a long-term view, I think the shares still look good value trading at 9.52 times forward earnings. They’re not as cheap as when I bought them last year, but I’ll still top up my stake when I have the cash. The rising yield and recovering share price are impossible for me to resist."},

Compared to its older sibling, the  FTSE 100 , the UK’s flagship growth index has historically generated a superior return of around 11% a year versus 8%. Of course, it’s been a more  volatile  experience. Yet for those saving for retirement, the long time horizon may permit greater risk-taking. So how much money would I have made if I’d invested in the FTSE 250 in July 2014? Owning the FTSE 250 since 2014 Since then, shareholders in low-cost FTSE 250 tracker funds have earned a total return of 68.98% to date. So those who invested £10,000 a decade ago now have just shy of £17,000. That’s certainly nothing to scoff at. But breaking down this return on an annualised basis quickly reveals a problem. That 69% over 10 years is the equivalent of just 5.4% a year — half of what the index has generated on average since its inception. How so? There are a lot of factors at play. However, one of the main reasons behind the lack of more recent growth stems from a lack of exposure to the tech industry. For reference, only 1.3% of the entire FTSE 250 is concentrated in technology. The lion’s share is instead focused on financials, consumer staples, and industrials, none of which exactly have a reputation for explosive growth. But there have been several constituents who’ve made a big splash.  Games Workshop  ( LSE:GAW ) is up almost 1,700% or 33.5% a year since July 2014 and that’s even before taking dividends into account! Sadly, as a market-cap-weighted index, the impressive returns of small-cap companies often get drowned out by the lacklustre returns of larger enterprises. And by the time these firms gain significant influence over the FTSE 250, most of the growth story may have already happened. The power of stock picking Index tracker funds come with a lot of advantages. But they’re far from a perfect solution to building wealth. And for those seeking chunky market-beating returns, a  stock-picking strategy  may be more appropriate. Instead of owning hundreds of businesses, investors can build a more concentrated portfolio consisting of only the top-notch enterprises they want to own. This requires a far more hands-on approach and comes with higher risk since a poorly constructed and managed portfolio can end up destroying wealth. But it also means the explosive performance of companies like Games Workshop doesn’t get drowned out by the underperformance of other lacklustre enterprises. This company, in particular, has seen tremendous success. It’s thanks primarily to the pricing power that’s been cultivated by management for decades. Pairing that with a global partnership network with independent retailers, the business was able to expand its footprint globally at negligible cost. The end result is rapid growth with double-digit margins that continue to grow even today. Of course, not every FTSE 250 company has enjoyed the same fate. Cineworld was once a FTSE 250 darling, after all. Even Games Workshop has its fair share of risks to tackle even today. It’s up to stock pickers to do the research to find the best opportunities. That’s something index investors don’t have to worry about. Personally, I still prefer to pick my own stocks (like Games Workshop) for potentially richer rewards."},

That’s because the company’s share price nearly halved in response to an unexpected profits warning for the year ending 31 July (FY24). The data and analytics technology group announced that it expects revenue to be around 5% below the consensus forecast of analysts. And — rather alarmingly — earnings to be 32% lower. Prior to releasing the news, the company was expected to record an adjusted FY24 operating profit of around £62m. Its shares were trading on a multiple of 15 times this figure. It’s now anticipating a profit of £41m-£44m. After the recent fall, its market-cap is currently 11 times higher. On the face of it, the company’s shares are now offering better value than before they crashed. But I think there are a number of reasons why the position in which YouGov finds itself is more complicated than this. Doom and gloom Primarily, there was little positive news to accompany the profits warning. Sales have been slower than anticipated in its Data Products division with its “ fast-turnaround ” research services affected the most.  The company also reported “ challenges ” in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.  And although its newly-acquired Consumer Panel Services business is said to be performing in line with expectations, some of its sales will now slip into FY25. Also, the company has borrowed heavily to help fund its expansion. At 31 January, its  balance sheet  disclosed  debt of £214m . This is more than the company’s book (accounting) value of £189m. If YouGov isn’t able to grow its earnings, its ability to borrow more will be restricted. It will then be unable to expand through acquisition, further damaging its earnings growth. Two magic words However, despite these warning signs, I believe artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform its business. For a while now, the company’s been using machine-learning to improve the accuracy of its predictions. It’s also adopted AI to detect and remove ‘suspect’ respondents to its surveys. But AI models need to be ‘trained’ using vast quantities of data. And YouGov is well placed to provide this information. The company also has an excellent track record in increasing its profits. During the 13 years to FY23, it grew its earnings per share in 12 of them. Not convinced But despite these positive reasons to invest, my confidence in the company has taken a bit of a knock. On 26 March, the directors told shareholders: “ While the overall weakness in macro sentiment may impact the speed and level of some client spending, we remain confident in achieving current market expectations for the full year ”. For the business to decline so badly — in less than three months — makes me nervous. I’m therefore going to watch from the sidelines with a view to revisiting the investment case when I know more about the company’s performance."},

That was a 73% increase on the previous year and, if repeated in 2024, means  the stock is currently yielding 3.7% . This is based on a share price as I write on Friday (28 June) of £27.78. If this dividend was maintained for a period of 20 years — and the income used to buy more shares in the company — an initial investment of £19,974 (719 shares) would grow to £41,083. At that point, passive income of £126 a month could be earned. This assumes the share price remains unchanged throughout the period. But Greggs doesn’t have a reputation as an income stock.  Instead, the company has ambitious plans for growth and prefers to retain some of its surplus cash to reinvest in the business.  This has helped its share price increase nearly 1.5 times since September 2020. An alternative scenario So what happens if my hypothetical 719 shares grew by a modest 5% a year and the company continued to pay a dividend of £1.02 a share for 20 years? In these circumstances, my initial investment would grow to £82,284 within two decades. At that point, I could earn £255 a month in passive income. But Greggs’ recent track record is a little erratic when it comes to dividends.  The company seeks to retain £50m-£60m of cash on its  balance sheet . Any surplus — after taking into account the capital expenditure requirements of the business — is then returned to shareholders by way of special dividend. For two of the past three financial years, it has supplemented its interim and final payouts with a special dividend of 40p. It therefore doesn’t appear as though a return of £1.02 a share can be relied upon. Of course, dividends are  never  guaranteed. But it appears to me that Greggs’ special payout is particularly vulnerable to being cut. Dividend FY21  (pence) FY22  (pence) FY23  (pence) Interim 15 15 16 Final 42 44 46 Special 40 – 40 Total 97 59 102 Source: company reports / FY = financial year Future prospects And I suspect the company’s share price is unlikely to grow as rapidly as it has done in recent times. That’s because I think its shares are already quite expensive. Analysts are expecting earnings per share of 148.7p for the company’s 2024 financial year. This means the stock has a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18.7. It’s hard to find a company that’s directly comparable to Greggs. But for comparison,  Domino’s Pizza Group  has a P/E ratio of 11 and the  FTSE 100 ’s multiple is currently around 10.5. However, the food-to-go retailer has a good reputation with consumers. It was voted number one for value in the  YouGov  BrandIndex 2023. It also owns its supply chain. This gives it greater control over its input costs and reduces its reliance on third-parties. And the first 19 weeks of 2024 have started well. Like-for-like sales growth was 7.4%. However, despite these positive reasons to invest, I think there are better value opportunities for me elsewhere. Instead of buying 719 Greggs shares I could purchase other stocks offering a more generous dividend. For example, there are several members of the FTSE 100 currently offering yields in excess of 5%. That’s why I don’t want to take a position in the sausage roll and pie retailer."},

I owned the stock a few years back but after rising over 120% in 18 months between January 2020 and July 2021, I decided to offload my shares and pocket the profit. Since then, however, its share price has retreated and that grabbed my attention. There are a few factors that tempted me to add it to my holdings once again. I’m also incredibly keen to start building up my position. With any investable cash I have, I plan to purchase more shares this month. I reckon investors should consider buying the stock too. Let me explain why. Valuation The main factor is that Scottish Mortgage looks undervalued. First, its share price looks cheap. It’s trading 42% lower than its all-time high of £15.28, which it reached back in November 2021. With its shares currently trading at £8.84, that looks like good value. This is reinforced when considering that right now it trades at a 9.4% discount to its net asset value (NAV). Looking at whether a fund is trading at a discount or premium to its NAV is one of the most common ways to value it. When a trust is discounted compared to its NAV, it essentially means investors can gain access to the companies it owns for cheaper than their market rate. Gaining momentum Of course, its cheap price coupled with a  Footsie rally  means that the stock has been gaining momentum recently. Year to date it’s up 12.5%. In the last year, it has climbed 39.1%. Scottish Mortgage shares aren’t as cheap as they have been. But I’m still eager to buy more.  Artificial intelligence What’s more, I feel that its share price has the potential to keep rising from here. One reason I think this is because of its focus on the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. It owns top names in the industry such as  Nvidia ,  ASML , and  Tesla . The AI market is predicted to keep booming in the years to come. The risks That said, there’s no such thing as a free lunch. Investing in Scottish Mortgage comes with risks. One is that while it’s trading at that discount, over a quarter of the fund’s holdings are private companies. Valuing these companies can often be a challenge. So, there’s that to consider. The trust’s performance can also be  very volatile . That’s due to the focus on areas such as AI as well as its heavy weighting to growth stocks. While these stocks can produce mouthwatering returns, on the other hand, share prices in these companies can experience massive swings. I’m buying But do I back Scottish Mortgage to excel over the long run? I’d say so. That’s what’s most important to me. And it seems that’s also the case for the trust’s management, which looks to maximise returns over the long term. At its cheap price, I’ll be picking up more shares in the weeks ahead."},

Some of these are set up for screening top  dividend shares , others more for growth. Yet one I always check is for companies that have fallen in value, with a low  price-to-earnings  ratio. As such, this aims to filter for cheap shares that I can consider buying for the new month. A reputational wobble One that has popped up is  GSK  ( LSE:GSK ). The pharma giant saw the share price drop 14% last month which acted to push the price-to-earnings ratio below 10 (my fair value benchmark). Most of the drop came at the start of the month with news regarding its  Zantac  heartburn drug legal case. Around 70,000 cases have been brought forward claiming that the drug causes cancer, which if proven would have large reputational and financial implications. The stock dropped by 10% after the court ruled that jury trials could hear expert witnesses as part of the trial. Even though this situation is a risk, I think the stock has overreacted. The business has been around for decades and has successfully navigated problems like this in the past. I don’t see this being an issue if we fast forward a year. Even when I zoom out from the one month performance, I can see the stock’s still up 9% over the past year. Further, GSK’s a profitable company that’s growing year on year. For example, versus 2022, the firm increased revenue, operating profit and pre-tax profit last year. This also helps the dividend payments. With a yield just shy of 4%, I think this could be a cheap share to snap up to benefit from both share price gains and income. Trending lower, but not forever Another option on my radar is  Jupiter Asset Management  ( LSE:JUP ). The stock dropped 11% over the last month, bringing the loss over the past year to 28%. The business has struggled with the tough macro environment in recent years, alongside tougher competition in the investment management space. However, there comes a point where I think this becomes too cheap to ignore. After all, total assets under management from Q1 increased to £52.6bn from £52.2bn the previous quarter. A good chunk of this was driven by positive market returns of the funds. Ultimately, the higher the assets under management figure is, the more fee driven revenue and commission Jupiter can earn. I like the company because even with the difficulties that the whole sector has dealt with, it’s still profitable. Given that fact, I can still use the price-to-earnings ratio to get a feel for value. It’s currently at 5.22. Of course, the risk here is that I buy now but the trend is still lower for the share price over the next year before it starts to rally. This is possible, but I struggle to see how much lower this can go, given that there are zero signs that the company is going bust anytime soon. Overall, I’m thinking about buying both shares as we start the month."},

It deserves a closer look", "title_link": "https://www.fool.co.uk/2024/07/01/this-stock-just-joined-the-ftse-250-it-deserves-a-closer-look/", "published_date": "1 July, 2024", "publisher_name": "Edward Sheldon, CFA", "Description": "In late June,  Alpha Group International  ( LSE: ALPH ) joined the  FTSE 250  index. This was a major milestone for the company. Here, I’m going to provide some insight into what this under-the-radar business does. I’m also going to explain why I think investors should consider buying the stock today. What it does Alpha Group is a leading provider of enhanced financial solutions to corporations and institutions globally. Working with clients across 50+ countries, it blends intelligent human capabilities with financial technology to provide solutions in relation to FX risk management, mass payments, fund finance, and cash management. Formerly known as Alpha FX, the company listed on the  London Stock Exchange ’s  AIM  in 2017 at a market-cap of £64m. Since then, it’s grown remarkably – led by founder and CEO Morgan Tillbrook – to have a market-cap of £962m. Why I like it From an investment perspective, this company’s a lot going for it, in my view. For starters, it has a really strong growth track record. Over the last five years, revenue’s climbed from £24m to £110m (annualised growth of 36%). For this year and next, City analysts expect revenue of £129m and £149m respectively. It’s also a really profitable business. Between 2018 and 2023, return on capital employed (ROCE) averaged 26%. High ROCE companies tend to be good long-term investments because they can compound their profits. Additionally, the company has a fast-growing dividend (the yield’s only 0.75% at the moment) and a rock-solid balance sheet. It’s also doing  share buybacks  (it recently announced a £20m buyback), which should help to drive earnings per share higher. Finally, it has a driven CEO with a track record of success. It’s worth noting here that founder-led companies are often good investments too. \n I am very excited about the future for Alpha, and look forward to us continuing our trajectory of growth and delivering value to our shareholders in the years ahead. \n Morgan Tillbrook, founder & CEO of Alpha Group Add in the fact that the company’s now part of the FTSE 250 index (meaning that a lot more professional fund managers will be able to invest in it) and there’s a lot to like. The risks Of course, it’s not perfect. Alpha Group operates in a competitive industry and it’s likely to face competition from some powerful rivals in the years ahead. It’s hard to know how much of a genuine competitive advantage it has. Another issue here is the valuation – it’s a pricey stock as investors have spotted the growth and quality here. Currently, the forward-looking  price-to-earnings  (P/E) ratio is about 29. That multiple doesn’t leave any room for error. Overall though, I think this company has the potential to generate strong returns in the long run. I own its shares (I’m up about 250% since I first bought them in 2019) and I plan to hold them in the years ahead."},

During that time, it rose 5.7%. UK shares haven’t been the most popular with investors in recent years. But with the Footsie surging, the tide seems to be turning. That said, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. There’s the potential we could be in store for a shaky month. The election That’s largely due to the general election on 4 July. There’s a plenty of data out there suggesting what the FTSE 100 could do depending on which political party comes into power. For example, one snippet I saw the other day from global investment powerhouse  Schroders  stated that general election campaigns that look likely to have a clear-cut winner tend to lead to the Footsie rising. The Labour Party is ahead in major political polls. That means we could see the Footsie rally this month following the election. But of course, while polls give us a good indication of what the outcome is likely to be, there’s always the possibility of a surprise. That’s why I’m expecting  some volatility . I’m still buying But guessing what the stock market will do in the short term isn’t a smart move. I don’t invest for a quick payday. Instead, I’m looking for undervalued shares and I see plenty in the UK market. Take  Burberry  ( LSE: BRBY ) as an example. There’s no hiding it, the British icon has posted a terrible performance in the last 12 months. It’s down 58.6% in that time. This year alone the stock has lost 37.3% of its value. But with that, I’m now tempted to snap up some shares. They look cheap, trading on 11.9  times earnings . Burberry’s long-term historical average is 23. This signals to me there could be serious value to be had. That said, its share price is down for a reason. Sales have taken a hit. Its pre-tax profit fell by 40% in 2023 from £634m to £383m. Consumer spending in markets such as the US has slowed down due to higher inflation and interest rates. Sales fell 14% in the second half of 2023. Perhaps more worryingly, sales fell 17% year on year in Q4 in Asia Pacific, Burberry’s largest market. Looking ahead, the firm has said it expects to face further challenges in the coming months. But as I said, I tend not to focus on the short-term outlook. And as we begin to see rate cuts later this year, I’d expect spending to pick up again. Burberry hasn’t been alone in its recent struggles. Many of its peers have also been hit as consumers tighten their belts. I’m optimistic we’ll begin to see this change in the months ahead. Bouncing back Burberry is a company that’s been operating since 1856. So, I believe that over the long run it can bounce back from this tough spell. On top of that, with its share price taking a beating, the stock has an attractive 6.2% dividend yield, clearing the Footsie average of 3.6% by some margin. That’s some juicy passive income for me to collect while I sit patiently and wait for its share price to start trending in the right direction. If I had the cash, I’d buy Burberry shares today."},

Well, it’s certainly on my focus list.  I like the firm’s long-term record of steady operational progress. Over the past 10 years, revenue’s notched up a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6% and adjusted earnings per share of 10%. They’re not the kind of exciting numbers that raise pulses to dangerous levels. However, the financial and trading record shows consistent improvement. In short, the stock looks a decent candidate to consider for a  long-term investment . Porvair operates in the specialist filtration, laboratory and environmental technology sectors. The directors aim to focus on markets with long-term growth potential. On top of that, the company seeks to serve areas where  “product use is mandated and replacement demand is regular”. Well-financed organic and acquisitive growth I reckon that approach might be one of the key drivers behind the firm’s consistent growth and trading over the past few years. Porvair’s operating segments are Aerospace & Industrial, Laboratory and Metal Melt Quality, all of which the directors insist have  “clear”  long-term growth drivers. Meanwhile, the progress of the overall business has been both organic and via acquisitions. So I’d expect more of the same ahead. Today’s (1 July) interim results statement shows year-on-year revenue grew by 5% in the six months to 31 May. Although at constant currency rates, the rise was 8%. However, currency adjusted underlying sales revenue actually fell by 3%. The overall rise occured because of the effects of prior acquisitions. That weakness in like-for-like performance was caused by softening in the industrial and laboratory consumables markets. There was a trend among customers of reducing inventory levels  “and more normal lead times through 2023 and 2024”. De-stocking combined with adverse currency exchange rates to cause the firm’s profit margins to drop a bit too. The situation demonstrates that Porvair’s operations are sensitive to general economic and cyclical influences. So the growth trajectory here’s unlikely to ever be straight up. As with most businesses, we could see volatility for operations and the stock over the coming years. It’s one of the risks here and has the potential to cause a losing investment for shareholders. The directors said today that  “ Inconsistency in trading patterns across the Group is not unusual” . Anticipating a strengthening second half Nevertheless, the company expects underlying market growth to return during the second half of the trading year. On top of that, the long-term growth drivers of Porvair’s operating sectors are robust. And chief executive Ben Stocks said the business looks set to move into 2025  “in good shape”. City analysts anticipate mid-single-digit percentage advances for earnings and the dividend next year. Set against those estimates and with the share price near 668p, the forward-looking earnings multiple is just below 17. And the anticipated dividend yield’s a little under 1%. That’s not the cheapest valuation in the world. But the  balance sheet  looks strong and multi-year trading performance has been consistent overall. I’d dive in with deeper research, then watch this one with a view to considering the stock on market dips and down-days."},

But the UK may already have its very own AI hero – albeit one that’s headquartered in Canada.  Despite a £1.03bn market cap, Toronto-based  Alphawave Semi  ( LSE: AWE ) isn’t well-known in the UK. Until recently it was trading as Alphawave IP and has remained fairly under the radar. Yet somehow I think the world will be hearing a lot more about this AI-focused semiconductor company soon.  Major partnerships At first, I thought it was just another computer company jumping on the AI bandwagon. But as an IT geek, I’m in awe (pun intended) after looking at its product line. It designs the most cutting-edge 7nm process nodes used in semiconductor production, forging partnerships with tech giants like  TSMC ,  Samsung  and  Intel . However, unlike these companies, it doesn’t manufacture and market its tech. Rather, it uses a capital-light licensing model allowing companies to use its designs. Subsequently, I think this relatively small company has all the early signs of the next big thing in tech:  \n a volatile share price that’s massively overvalued. \n\n\n\n a volatile accounting history (trading was temporarily suspended last year after auditors delayed issuing its final accounts) \n\n\n\n major brokers like  Blackrock  and  JPMorgan  shorting the stock \n\n\n\n earnings forecast to grow 108% in the next year \n Call me contrarian but that sounds like the chaotic early days of every major tech stock that made it big. Europe’s best AI play? Now, before I get ahead of myself, the company is currently unprofitable. Its earnings per share (EPS) fell sharply throughout 2023 and are now deep in the negatives. What’s more, shareholders recently got diluted when the company issued 4% more shares to the pool. And the cherry on top? Revenue missed expectations by 8% in the recent full-year 2023  earnings report .  So what makes me think this stock is going anywhere other than straight down the toilet? Well first and foremost, I’m not the only one. Major broker Jefferies recently described the stock as  “Europe’s best AI play” . Whether or not that pans out remains to be seen. But there are some signs to support it. The company is forecast to become profitable within the next 18 months and revenue is expected to double by the end of 2026. Either way, sentiment around the stock appears to be net positive and people are starting to take note. But at the same time, it’s high-risk. Risk vs reward The bloated share price is now four times larger than its revenue per share – considerably higher than the industry average of 2.5 times. This number is forecast to decrease as sales improve but buyers at this price may be paying too much. And although earnings are forecast to improve,  return on equity (ROE)  will likely remain below the industry average for the next three years.  The company’s also put a lot of money into R&D lately, leading to an operating loss of £42m in 2023. If the gamble doesn’t pay off it could spiral into debt. Overall, I think it’s an exciting stock that could go either way. Certainly, it’s one to keep an eye on!"},

Owning a well-constructed diversified portfolio, meant it wasn’t hard to generate a return of 10%, or more. As we start the second half of the year, I remain bullish on stocks. However, there are a few areas of the market that look really interesting to me right now. Dividend stocks Dividends aren’t my main area of focus. With 15-20 years until retirement, I’m mainly seeking growth (and not income) at the moment. However, looking at the market today, the outlook for dividend stocks is attractive, to my mind. That’s because interest rates are likely to fall in the second half of the year. As rates come down and savers discover that they can’t get the same level of interest on their cash savings, dividend stocks should come back into focus. Especially those that have a history of dividend increases. This should push share prices up, leading to attractive total returns (gains plus income) for investors. One dividend stock I like (and own) is  Unilever . It doesn’t have the highest  yield , but I reckon it should do well overall as rates fall. The healthcare sector A sector I like the look of as we start the second half of the year is healthcare. It lagged the overall market in H1 and I reckon it may play catch-up in H2. One reason I like this sector is that it stands to benefit from portfolio rebalancing. As investors take profits from tech and redeploy them into other areas of the market, it could do well. Another is that there are some amazing innovations within the healthcare space right now. From robotic surgery to weight-loss drugs that can help people lose up to 20% of their body weight, we’re seeing a lot of exciting developments. To increase my exposure to the sector, I’ve recently been channelling capital into a healthcare fund. This gives me exposure to around 70 stocks across the industry. UK mid- and small-caps Finally, I think mid-sized and smaller UK companies look pretty attractive right now. These areas of the market were smashed when interest rates rose a few years ago. If rates come down in the second half as predicted, these stocks could experience a major rebound. One stock that stands out to me in this space is  Gamma Communications  ( LSE: GAMA ). It’s a leading provider of business communication solutions. Before interest rates spiked, this stock was trading above 2,300p. Today however, it can be snapped up for around 1,400p. That’s an attractive price for this stock, in my view. Looking at analysts’ earnings estimates, the forward-looking  P/E ratio  is just 17.5 at present, which is very reasonable given the company’s rate of growth (analysts expect 9% revenue and earnings growth this year). Of course, an economic slowdown remains a risk here. This could result in businesses spending less on new technology. Taking a three-to-five year view however, I reckon this stock should do well. It’s worth noting that analysts at Berenberg have a price target of 1,980p on it. That’s 40% higher than the current share price."},

My own approach to earning money without working for it consists of buying shares in blue-chip companies like  Vodafone  and  British American Tobacco  ( LSE: BATS ). That approach can be tailored to individual financial circumstances. If I wanted to target £700 in average monthly passive income, here are the seven steps I would take. 1. Start saving regularly I would get into a disciplined habit of putting aside a set amount on a regular basis. The more I save to invest, the sooner I should hit my target. But I need to be realistic. In this example, I use a weekly contribution of  £85 . 2. Set up a share-dealing account That money cannot be used to buy income shares unless I have a mechanism to do so. So I would set up a  share-dealing account  or  Stocks and Shares ISA  and start drip feeding money into it. 3. Learn how stock markets work Next I would get to grips with some of the basics of investing. For example, as dividends are never guaranteed but form the basis of my passive income plan, I would want to learn  how to read company accounts . I would also learn concepts like  free cash flow , as my potential passive income is basically some of the surplus cash generated by blue-chip companies. 4. Decide on an investment strategy Another move would be to decide how I would aim to achieve my goal. With passive income as my target, I would be buying  dividend shares rather than growth shares . But I would still have a few things to consider, before I made a move. For example, British American Tobacco’s 9.5% dividend yield is high (indeed, among the highest for any  FTSE 100  share). But its core business is cigarettes and demand is declining in many markets. On top of that there is a minefield of regulatory risks that could hurt future profitability. So, I would need to decide what risk level I was willing to accept. I might also consider whether I would shun some shares on ethical grounds. Using tobacco kills millions of people – and British American Tobacco has built its business around the habit. 5. Buy shares Having set my strategy, I would next look for shares to buy. Price matters even for dividend shares, as a falling share price could mean I ultimately lose money despite the dividends. Over time I would build a diversified portfolio of income shares. I would look for companies with the sort of competitive advantage that gives them pricing power, like British American’s portfolio of premium brands does. 6. Earning and reinvesting income I could start  earning passive income  fast in the form of dividends. But, to hit my target faster, I would not do that straight away. Instead, I would reinvest my dividends (known as  compounding ) while continuing to add £85 a week of money. 7. Being patient I would then stick to this system over time. At a lower yield than British American’s – say 6% — I ought to hit my £700 monthly passive income target within 18 years. That yield is above the FTSE 100 average, but I believe it is achievable if I find the right shares to buy."},

With the telecom company’s share price near 139p (26 June), the forward-looking dividend yield for the trading year to March 2026 is almost 5.8%. That’s tempting in itself. But after chief executive Allison Kirkby’s assessment last month, I reckon there’s a good chance of incremental dividend growth in the coming years. Recovery and growth So shareholders may be able to lock in a decent and growing passive income from that dividend. But there’s the possibility of capital gains from a rising share price too. It’s happened before. BT looked like it was on the floor in spring 2009 after the credit-crunch and during that decade’s ‘great’ recession. But between then and the end of 2015, the stock rose by more than 500%. However, one of the ongoing worries is the company’s mountain of debt on the  balance sheet . That’s been fuelled by the need to invest so much money into next-generation networks, including the massive full-fibre broadband rollout. So Kirkby’s assertion that the firm has now passed peak capital expenditure (capex) on the fibre network came as a relief to the market. I reckon that’s what the strong rally in the shares has been all about. Such sudden moves higher often put off value-oriented investors. That’s understandable. But one argument is the fundamentals and outlook of the business have improved. Therefore, the up-rating looks justified. The company’s £3bn cost and service  “transformation”  programme was completed a year ahead of schedule. And the business has reached  “the inflection point” , regarding its long-term strategy, Kirkby said. Increasing free cash flow It’s been well reported, but now the firm reckons it can more than double its normalised free cash flow over the next five years. Nothing’s guaranteed and the business may yet run into more unforeseen challenges along the way. For example, a down-turn in the economy would almost certainly sink the share price again. Nevertheless, forecasts for better  free cash flow  strike me as a supportive factor for ongoing growth in the dividend – perhaps the most important factor of all. After years of nose-wrinkling, I’m finally starting to believe that BT may be capable of passing my sniff test. Things feel different to me now. This turning business may be entering an enduring period of recovery and growth (I hope). Looking ahead, Kirkby said the company’s sharpening its focus and  “accelerating”  the modernisation of its operations. It’s also aiming to optimise its global business operations. Overall, Kirkby reckons BT’s now positioned to generate  “significant”  growth. And, on balance and despite the risks, I think the stock has the potential to deliver decent passive income for its shareholders via an ongoing stream of dividends. However, despite my enthusiasm, I’d stop short of calling it a no-brainer because all stocks have the potential to disappoint as well as to delight. But I see it as worthy of further research."},

But not all. Take  ME Group  ( LSE: MEGP ) as an example. Four years ago, the company was trading firmly in penny share territory. Since then, it has more than quadrupled, thanks to solid profits and cash flows. While you may never have heard of the company, there is a fair chance you have seen (or even used) one of its thousands of photo machines in supermarkets, shopping centres, and elsewhere, or one of its RevolutIon   laundry machines. Attractive business model This is a lucrative business. The company operates in areas that have high demand. Even during the depths of the pandemic, when ME Group was trading as a penny share, revenues fell but did not collapse. Created using TradingView When it comes to profitability, earnings have moved around.  Even before the pandemic earnings per share had declined – and they took a pummelling over the next several years, helping explain why ME was trading as a penny share. Created using TradingView But as the chart above shows, they are now stronger than they have ever been. I think that speaks to the appeal of ME’s business model: its automated machine network means that its labour costs can be kept low, while the services it offers tend to have robust demand. If people need to do their laundry, they need to do their laundry. Valuation could offer long-term value But a good business does not necessarily make a good investment.  Valuation  matters too. I think ME Group stacks up fairly well on that front. Looking at the current  price-to-earnings ratio  of 13, I think it offers the potential for long-term appreciation if earnings per share continue to increase in future. On top of that, the dividend yield of 4.3% looks attractive to me. I think the company’s unique estate of machines and long experience of vending machines helps set it apart from competitors. But there are risks. As we saw during the pandemic, any drop in the number of people visiting shopping centres can lead to a sharp drop in demand. Buy or wait? Having been a penny share within the last four years, though, could ME Group head back there any time soon? Anything is possible in the markets, of course, but for now at least I think the firm’s robust business performance is likely to keep the share price buoyant. Its lack of competition in many areas gives it pricing power, which I think could mean we see even higher earnings in future. So, even though it no longer offers the screaming value it did as a penny share, if I had spare cash to invest today I would be happy to add ME Group to my portfolio."},

A dividend growth stock to consider stashing in a SIPP for decades", "title_link": "https://www.fool.co.uk/2024/06/30/8-7-yield-a-dividend-growth-stock-to-consider-stashing-in-a-sipp-for-decades/", "published_date": "30 June, 2024", "publisher_name": "Royston Wild", "Description": "Investing in UK shares can be an effective way to source a large and growing passive income. The  FTSE 100  and  FTSE 250  in particular are home to stacks of top dividend growth stocks. These indexes are packed with established businesses that have market leading positions and robust business models, giving them stable earnings and strong cash flow. This is the perfect recipe for them to deliver a dependable (and often growing) dividend over time. A top SIPP buy Remember that dividends are never, ever guaranteed. Indeed, they can fall, or even be suspended altogether, when broader economic conditions worsen. However, a well diversified portfolio — one which provides exposure to different companies across multiple sectors and geographies — can still generate a rising passive income year after year. But which UK shares are the best ones to buy for dividend growth today? Here, I’ve identified one that could be a great long-term buy for those who own a  Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP) . REITs rule Real estate investment trusts (REITs)  can be some of the most secure dividend stocks out there. The regular rents they receive often provide a dependable income that they can distribute to their shareholders. In fact, these special property stocks are required to pay 90% of annual rental earnings out by way of dividends. While other shares can choose whether or not to pay dividends, REITS simply have no choice if their rental operations are profitable. Assura  ( LSE:AGR ) is one such share with a strong history of dividend growth. It’s raised annual payouts for the last 11 years on the spin. Over the past nine years, dividends have risen at a healthy compound average of 7% too. Created with TradingView Robust earnings There are around 50 REITs listed on the  London Stock Exchange  today. But I like this one because its operations can be considered particularly defensive. As mentioned above, stable earnings usually translate to regular — and in this case, growing dividends. You see, Assura owns, manages, and leases out medical centres across the UK. More specifically, it owns more than 600 GP surgeries, diagnostics centres and primary healthcare facilities.  Needless to say, these properties remain in high demand at all points of the economic cycle. So in this regard, Assura doesn’t have to worry about empty buildings and problematic rent collection during downturns. Furthermore, the majority of rents that doctors, NHS bodies and other healthcare providers pay the company are indirectly funded by the government. This, in turn, reduces the possibility of rent defaults. 8.7% dividend yield Of course no share is without risk. In the case of Assura, changes to NHS policy could significantly alter its long-term growth prospects. But as things stand today, it’s looking good. Demand for primary healthcare facilities is growing as the government tries to ease the strain on packed hospitals. It is likely to continue expanding too, as Britain’s elderly population swells. City analysts are expecting Assura’s dividends to continue growing for the next three years, at least. This means its dividend yield stands at a whopping 8.4%, and eventually rises as high as 8.7%. If I didn’t already own shares in industry peer  Primary Health Properties , I’d buy Assura shares to boost my long-term passive income."},

That was  Tempus AI  ( NASDAQ: TEM ), a healthcare firm using artificial intelligence (AI) to help physicians personalise patient care. Founded in 2015, its revenue is rising sharply and it’s backed by Google. Should I snap up this stock in case it becomes the next Nvidia? Personalised cancer diagnosis  This is how Tempus AI describes its mission: “ Our goal is to embed AI, including generative AI, throughout every aspect of diagnostics to enable physicians and researchers to make personalised, data-driven decisions that improve patient care .” The firm’s technology analyses medical data to make sure patients are on the right therapy at the right time. Cancer is its predominant focus. The company’s CEO is Eric Lefkofsky, who co-founded  Groupon  back in the day. Following his wife’s cancer diagnosis, he was perplexed at how little personal data informed her treatment. So he founded Tempus, meaning there’s a real purpose underpinning the company, which I like. It raised $410m going public and other blue-chip backers include  Softbank  and  Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust . How fast is it growing?  The company generates revenue through genomics diagnostics tests and by charging pharmaceutical companies that want access to its vast library of clinical oncology insights. Revenue from its direct AI applications is so far minimal. Around 95% of the world’s top 20 pharma firms have used its products. And it now has partnerships with over 200 healthcare companies, including  AstraZeneca  and  GSK . I’m fascinated by the potential of its Tempus One product. This is an AI-powered clinical assistant trained on vast amounts of genomic data that provides insights to physicians directly at their fingertips. It allows for real-time decision-making at the point of care. The company is growing rapidly, as we can see below. Annual revenue  2023 $532m 2022 $321m 2021 $258m 2020 $188m Losses However, the firm is also still loss-making, which adds risk to the investment case. Last year, it reported a net loss of $214m, down from $289m the year before. While it expects to generate positive  EBITDA  in 2025, its IPO prospectus also mentions that it might need to tap investors for more cash in future. So I’d expect the stock price to be highly volatile. In fact, we’ve already got a taste of this. After flying to $40 from its IPO price of $37, the share price fell to $23 before rebounding to $32. This gives the company a market cap of $4.8bn and puts the stock on a  price-to-sales  (P/S) multiple of around eight. That looks quite pricey, despite the impressive rate of growth. Tempted by Tempus? I’m careful not to get too excited about any stock with an ‘AI’ after its name. There’s a growing collection of these now –  C3.ai ,  SoundHound AI , and now Tempus AI. It’s all the rage. Overall though, I think there’s a lot to like here. The firm puts its combined addressable markets above $200bn. And while it’s best to take such estimates with a grain of salt, growth is really strong right now. However, it’s far too early to tell if this is the next big AI winner. Nvidia’s chips form the building blocks of AI infrastructure, whereas Tempus’s business model is promising yet still unproven. Therefore, as things stand, I reckon there are safer growth stocks to buy today."},

The important factor is the uncertainty of the election will soon be over. Businesses are often good at adapting to whatever general conditions prevail. But stock markets hate uncertainty. So we may see a relief rally just because all the tub-thumping and shouting will be over. I think it’s a good time to research FTSE 100 stocks right now. Therefore, I’d work down my watchlist and try to pick the best-looking opportunities to focus on. A resurgent retailer For example,  Marks and Spencer  ( LSE: MKS ) has paused its trend higher during June, and now is perhaps a good time to consider the business. After years of trying, the clothing, home and food retailer has finally clicked onto a turnaround strategy that’s working. The company’s rehabilitation efforts are being headed by chief executive Stuart Machin. From what I’ve read, Machin has earned a reputation as a switched-on and dynamic retail leader with great people skills. So the fortunes of the enterprise appear to be in good hands. He’s been at the helm for a couple of years now, and the outcomes are plain to see in the share price chart. Earnings have been rising and City analysts expect further advances this year and next. The company restarted shareholder dividends in the recent trading year to March. Predictions are for the payment to shoot up further by robust double-digit percentages ahead. The improvements in the figures reflect the big advances the firm’s making revitalising its operations. I can’t deny the share price has travelled a long way already. At 293p (27 June), it’s up by more than 180% since October 2022. However, my feeling is the UK may be at the beginning of an enduring period of prosperity and economic growth. A supportive environment ahead? Such outcomes aren’t guaranteed. However, if things work out as I hope, the general retail environment may be supportive of the firm’s further growth and progress. Marks and Spencer appears to be one of those multi-channel retailers winning business back from the pure internet operators. There are risks for shareholders though, as with any business. Perhaps the biggest is that another general economic down-turn may arrive. If that happens, earnings will likely suffer and take the stock price and dividends lower too. After all, no matter how well-run a business is, the retail sector’s  cyclical  and there’s no getting around that. Another risk is that Machin may leave the company at some point and the performance of a new leader will be uncertain. Nevertheless, the valuation looks fair here, rather than excessive. Set against analysts’ expectations for earnings, the forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio is just over 10 for next year. On balance, and despite the risks, I see Marks and Spencer as a decent FTSE 100 stock for further research and focus now. My aim would be to pick up a few of the shares to hold for years rather than mere weeks or months. However, I’d stop short of claiming it’s the best opportunity in the Footsie right now – that’s a tough call to make!"},

The past 12 months have seen Rolls-Royce shares soar by 195%. For an old company in a mature industry, that is an exceptional return. Whether the shares move up or down from here depends on a number of factors, including how well the company’s ambitious turnaround plan works to deliver its stretching medium-term targets. But looking at the incredible recent performance of Rolls-Royce shares, I can draw a couple of lessons I think may help me as I try to spot other potential stock market winners. Market size matters for business potential The performance of this  FTSE 100   business has been getting better over the past several years. But I would say the share price recovery has raced ahead of the business recovery. Why? One reason is that Rolls has an installed base of thousands of engines. Those will need to be serviced, in some cases for decades to come – and the obvious candidate to do that is the firm that manufactured them. On top of that, demand for expensive aircraft engines is high – and only a few companies are able to produce them at scale. For a share to perform like Rolls has over the past year, it helps if the City has confidence that the size of its potential market is large — and likely to stay that way. A vision for growth can create its own momentum Still, I said that I feel the shares have got ahead of themselves. To me, they look overvalued, based on current business performance. But the thing is, a lot of investors are not valuing them on current performance. Instead, they are factoring in what they think the business might be worth in future (on that basis, I think they could yet turn out to be cheap). That strikes me as a reasonable thing to do, but one of the risks involved is judging how a company may perform in a future that by definition is uncertain for now. That is true for Rolls-Royce, yet the shares have soared anyway.  I think that is because management has laid out a clear, specific plan for growth with numerical targets against which it can be judged. When looking for shares to buy though, I want to make sure the  valuation  I use to make my decision is not subject to more variables than I am comfortable with. In fact, that is why I do not own Rolls-Royce shares. I like the installed customer base, strong brand and proprietary technology. But if an event outside the firm’s control like a pandemic or terrorist attack sees demand plummet suddenly – as has happened in the past – I think the share price could fall sharply too. I find it helpful to separate what I see as the underlying value of a company and the momentum a share can sometimes get due to investor excitement. At the end of the day, I want to invest in what I see as great businesses selling as attractive prices, without being too distracted by price action driven by other investors’ enthusiasm."},

At the moment the Aviva  dividend yield  is 7%. I think it could go higher from here. So, should I invest? Promising dividend outlook Let me start by explaining why I am upbeat about what might happen to the payout. After all, it is just a few years since we saw an Aviva dividend cut (a reminder that no payout is ever guaranteed to last). Created using TradingView There are a couple of ways one might look at this as far as I am concerned. One is to say that insurance is a cyclical business – rates go up and underwriters do well, then at some point they fall again across the industry and profits shrink.  Another analysis is that Aviva has historically been a ragbag of different businesses, but under current management has become more focussed and has now put its dividend on a more sustainable footing than used to be the case. Which of these is more true (as both may be valid), only time will tell. But I think there is a lot to like about the business outlook for the insurer, from its large customer base, strong position in the UK market, and brand to its proven underwriting capabilities. The dividend grew by 7.7% last year. The yield is already 7%. So if the dividend growth rate can continue at its current level, the prospective yield a couple of years from now will be 8% and within five years, the  FTSE 100  share will be yielding a juicy 9%. Balancing risks and rewards Current management of the company strikes me as competent and realistic. So, for the Aviva dividend to keep growing at a strong clip, the business performance will need to support it. Often when looking at the sustainability of a dividend, I look at a firm’s free cash flow. Can that help here, though? Look at the chart. Created using TradingView Like a lot of financial services firms (especially insurers),  free cash flow  does not help me as much as it could. It reflects monies coming in and out that do not necessarily illustrate the underlying health of the company. So I pay more attention to how much surplus capital Aviva generates, as it can use that to help fund its dividend.  Here, I think things look promising. In its full-year results for last year, the company announced a share buyback. It also announced the cash cost of its dividend is set to keep growing by mid-single digits each year. That could be, for example, 5% — but as the buyback reduces the number of shares, that could mean a higher per share growth in the payout. If I had spare cash to invest, the potential of a growing Aviva dividend would make me want to add this income share to my portfolio."},

The London stock market’s blue-chip shares have underperformed significantly in recent years, a reflection of weak economic conditions and political turbulence in the UK. But investors need to be careful before piling into cheap stocks. Some low-cost FTSE 100 aristocrats have delivered brilliant returns in years gone by. Yet their current weak valuations reflect the challenges they face going forwards. Here are two Footsie legends I won’t touch with a bargepole next month. Tesco You’d think  Tesco  ( LSE:TSCO ) could be a dead cert to grow earnings as the UK’s population rapidly expands. In theory, more mouths to feed should translate to higher grocery sales, not to mention greater demand for the company’s non-edible items. The Office for National Statistics thinks Britain’s population will swell by 9.9% in the 15 years to 2036, to 73.7m. The problem is that competition in the supermarket sector’s extreme and growing rapidly. And it’s not just the scourge of the German discounters that’s a threat to Tesco’s earnings. In recent days,  Retail Gazette  announced fellow mid-tier retailer Morrisons plans to substantially expand its own store estate, opening 400 new Morrisons Daily convenience stores to take the total to 2,000 by 2025. \n Tesco’s performance against its rivals has been more promising of late. Its market share actually grew 52 basis points, to 27.6%, in the three months to 25 May. But it could struggle to keep this momentum as its rivals rapidly expand, attracting Tesco’s customers and prompting it to slash prices. Today, Tesco shares trade on a forward  price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio  of 12.2 times. While well below their five-year average of 20.3 times, I’ll still leaves the supermarket on the shelf today. Lloyds I’m also planning to continue giving  Lloyds Banking Group  ( LSE:LLOY ) shares a wide berth. On paper, the Black Horse Bank offers even better value than Tesco shares. It trades on a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.7 times. And its  dividend yield  for 2024 stands at a market-beating 5.7%. \n Signs of steady recovery in the housing market bode well for Lloyds, the UK’s biggest home loans provider. And things could get even better as interest rates will (likely) fall later in the year. But, overall, I believe the outlook for retail banks like this is pretty gloomy. Rate cuts will pull down the margins they make on their lending activities. Meanwhile, longstanding structural problems with the British economy could put a cap on earnings growth. And, like Tesco, the business faces growing competition, in this case from challenger banks like Monzo and Starling Bank. Finally, Lloyds specifically also faces significant charges if it’s found to have mis-sold motor finance products. It’s already taken a £450m charge in a worrying reminder of the hugely expensive PPI scandal of the 2010s. There are plenty of cut-price stocks on the FTSE 100 today. So I’m not tempted to take a chance with high-risk Tesco or Lloyds shares."},

The firm’s monopoly status in power transmission ensures consistent demand while its regulated revenue leads to stable income. The  FTSE 100  stock currently carries a forward-looking  dividend yield  of 5.4%. How much income could that generate from a £20k investment? Let’s find out.  Rights issue Firstly though, any notion that National Grid is a steady plodder throwing off rising dividends till the end of time was shattered in May. The share price tanked almost 20% in the days following a £7bn  rights issue . This gave shareholders like myself the right to buy more shares at a lower price, specifically seven new shares for every 24 held. The firm announced: “ Net proceeds…will principally be utilised to fund a higher growth investment phase for the Group, with around £60bn of capital investment expected during the 5-year period from FY25 to FY29 .” This is expected to drive underlying earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% over this period.  Income potential  One consequence of this increase in shares is that the dividend has been rebased. This puts the forward yield at 5.4%, down from 6.6%. So, how much could £20k earn back in passive income now? Well, on a 5.4% yield, the stock could generate £1,080 in annual dividends.  That’s better than the FTSE 100 average and broadly in line with other utilities. But there are over 10 Footsie shares currently with higher yields. I wouldn’t invest £20k into the stock. Ballooning debt  Like many stock-pickers, I keep notes on all my investments. These contain the reasons why I’m invested, with the sort of returns I’m hoping for if things pan out well. Key risks are highlighted to keep an eye on. The obvious risk with National Grid is its colossal debt pile. This has been rising dramatically in recent years as it builds new infrastructure, pays interest, and invests to decarbonise the energy network. In fact, net debt has risen from £26.5bn in FY18 to £42.8bn in FY24 (which ended in March). To be honest, I can only see it going higher over time. For context, this planned £60bn in capital spending over the next few years will be more than double what the utility giant spent over the last five years.  One positive is that the firm does still have assets to sell. It’s intending to offload its UK liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility and US onshore renewables operation. But once it becomes a pure-play networks business, what can it sell then? Further cash raises and even dividend cuts are a possibility at some point.  What I’m doing Following the rights issue, many brokers have been busy readjusting their share price targets. Currently, the consensus one-year target is 1,102p, which is 24% above today’s price of 887p. Of course, the shares may never reach such a price. But given this noticeably higher target, I’ll let the dust settle and see how things play out. I haven’t bought more shares and am very unlikely to do so. Overall, I’m relieved the share price is still  up  over five years. Investors have had a good run of payouts, even through the pandemic. But I think there are far better stocks to buy today for dividend growth."},

One is to put spare money into blue-chip shares I think could pay me substantial dividends for years to come. Understanding how dividends work Dividends are basically one way a company can choose to spend some or all of its spare cash. Not all businesses pay dividends, even if they generate excess cash. Of course, if a business does not make enough money over the long run then it will not pay dividends, even if has done so in the past. They are never guaranteed. To illustrate the concept, consider a company like  British American Tobacco  ( LSE: BATS ). You may not have heard of the  FTSE 100  firm but will probably have at least passing familiarity with some of the many premium brands it owns, such as  Lucky Strike . Making cigarettes is cheap and they can be sold at a high price – even more so for premium brands. So this is a highly cash generative business, something that has enabled British American Tobacco to raise the dividend per share it pays annually for decades. Will that last? Cigarette sales are declining in many markets and boosting selling prices can only go so far to offset the profit hurt from lower volumes. Maybe the business’s non-cigarette products will take up the slack, benefiting from its strong brands and distribution network. Building my portfolio To try and earn second income, I would want to own more than one share. If the risks I mention come to pass, British American Tobacco’s dividend could be cut. Another share I own is asset manager  M&G . it has a strong brand, large customer base and operates in a market that benefits from resilient demand. That all ought to be good when it comes to  generating surplus cash . But stock market turbulence could lead clients to withdraw funds, hurting profits. As a believer in long-term investing though, I feel happy to hold M&G. If I had spare cash to try and build a second income, I would also be happy to buy shares in  Legal & General . It also benefits from a strong brand and is highly cash generative.  Could a recently announced reorganisation drive efficiencies and boost profits at the firm – or damage morale and lead to lower earnings? Either could happen. Time will tell. Hundreds of pounds in monthly income Those three shares have dividend yields of 9.6%, 9.6% and 8.4% respectively. So the average  dividend yield  is 9.2%. That means that, for every £100 I invest, I will hopefully earn £9.20 each year in dividends, although I have to remember that this is not guaranteed and I could lose money as well as make it. That amount could fall if dividends are cut, though this trio have each grown their dividend annually in recent years. To hit my second income target next year, I could invest a £77,000 lump sum now. Alternatively, I could put in £50 a week and reinvest the dividends (known as  compounding ). Doing that, I would hopefully hit my second income target after 15 years."},

I’m a big fan of adding to winning stocks, so should I do that here?  A surging FTSE 100 share Since Russia’s tragic invasion of Ukraine, BAE stock has more than doubled. It’s jumped 19% in 2024 alone, far outpacing the  FTSE 100 ‘s return of 5.6% (both figures excluding dividends). Over five years, it’s rocketed 166%. Only  Frasers   Group  (up 220%),  Pershing Square Holdings  (202%), and  3i Group  (177%) top that. However, the BAE share price has dipped 5.7% since reaching 1,400p on 10 June. While it was due a breather, there do seem to be a couple of things that might be weighing on the shares.  First, French plane maker  Airbus  dropped a profit warning on 25 June. This hit the whole Europe aerospace and defence sector, to which BAE belongs. Airbus shares tanked 14% in the days following the announcement. Perhaps more noteworthy, there have been reports of Russia entering peace talks with Ukraine. While both sides seem miles apart on what they would be willing to concede, this might foreshadow a slump in the share price.  Logic suggests that the  defence sector  could sell off if peace breaks out. So this could be a risk buying the stock near its all-time high. Unfortunately though, as things stand, world peace seems like a long shot.  Solid growth forecast  Last year, BAE’s order book grew by £9bn to reach a colossal £58bn. This year, the company is expected to grow its revenue by 11% to £28.1bn, with operating profit also increasing by low double-digits to nearly £3bn. After that, growth should be solid but slower in 2025 and 2026. The stock is currently trading on a forward  price-to-earnings  (P/E) ratio of 19.5. Is that expensive? Well, it’s cheaper than  Rolls-Royce  (30) and the sector average (around 40). That said, perhaps the whole European defence sector is now overvalued. If that’s the case though, I find it reassuring that BAE stock isn’t among the most expensive of its peers. Another positive here is that the firm continues to buy back its own shares. In 2023, it repurchased £561m worth of shares, equivalent to 1.9% of the outstanding share capital.  There’s also a dividend carrying a forward yield of 2.45%, which I expect will continue growing. Last year, the company hiked its payout by 11%. Should I buy more shares? The company provides some of the world’s most advanced defence solutions, spanning land, sea, air, cyber, and space. The quote below highlights the breadth of offerings. \n Our focus on operational excellence continues… as we execute on complex, long-duration programmes like Dreadnought, Type 26 and Hunter Class frigates, Typhoon and F-35 jets, electronic warfare systems, combat vehicles, and many other programmes . \n Charles Woodburn, CEO of BAE Systems  Looking forward, management is understandably bullish given how nations are bolstering their defence capabilities. The average defence spending in Europe was 1.6% of GDP last year, short of the 2% target set by NATO. It could end up well above 2% in future given how bad the geopolitical situation is.   If BAE dips beneath 1,300p, I think I’ll buy more shares."},

But I keep coming back to UK  dividend stocks , for one main reason. I don’t have to do any work. I invest a bit of cash, and the company does all the work to earn my profits. Lovely. Also, I think UK stocks are among the best in the world for dividends. Shock at National Grid I don’t know why, but I’ve never bought  National Grid  ( LSE: NG. ), even though I see it as one of the UK’s best for long-term cash. Maybe it’s because, every time I have cash to invest, I see something I like better. I’ve found banks and other financials hard to resist in the past decade. Still, after National Grid’s recent surprise news, I’ve been looking at the stock again. Thanks to the effects of a new share issue, the price is down 16% so far in 2024. National Grid weakness The firm announced the new issue on 23 May, to raise £7bn in new funding. It needs the cash for its planned capital expenditure in the coming years, with the energy distribution business in a time of change. The successful takeup does look like good news. But then, the firm did offer the new shares to existing shareholders at a serious knockdown price of 645p. That makes me think its confidence might have been a bit weak. Still, it’s done and dusted now. And I think the whole thing makes National Grid look like a better long-term dividend buy. Future income There’s a range of forecasts out there now, and it looks like some have yet to take in the dilutive effect of the new share issue. The board says the total dividend will be maintained. And it plans to grow it in line with Consumer Prices Index  inflation . But the per-share cash has to drop this year. Still, forecasts (at least the ones that seem to have included the dilution) have a 5.7%  dividen d yield  down for 2025, and then rising. £2,000 a year With that return, I’d need to have a bit over £35,000 invested in National Grid to get my £2,000 per year in passive income. That’s about 4,000 shares. I don’t have that much cash spare, but I could get there. Just £200 per month, and I could reach my goal in 11 years. Will I finally buy National Grid shares? They’re on my wish list, for sure. But if I buy, I have to remember there’s a risk of the same kind of thing happening again in the future. Spread the risk That comes with buying shares in a regulated company, one that needs a lot of cash every year to maintain and develop its infrastructure.

I also think it is possible, even from a standing start and with no savings. But turning an ambitious goal like that into reality takes more than just positive thinking and optimism. It needs a realistic plan of action. I reckon I could use a Stocks and Shares ISA to aim for a million. Here’s how. Setting the right timeframe To begin, note that this is a long-term goal. I would not expect to start with nothing and become a millionaire in a short time. Instead my timeline here is in decades. What is the benefit of such a  long-term approach to investing ?  As I see it, it means I can do the work upfront of putting aside money and finding shares to buy. Then, if I choose the right shares, I can let time do the heavy lifting of turning my Stocks and Shares ISA into a portfolio of far higher value than the money I put in. Investing with a long-term vision Speaking of putting money in, how much would I invest? Everyone’s financial circumstances are different and any smart investment approach needs to reflect that. In this example, I imagine investing £850 each month. To do that, I would set up a  Stocks and Shares ISA  – there are lots to choose from – then start putting my money into it regularly. Ongoing target as I aim for a million Talking about getting my ISA value up to seven figures is ambitious. Breaking that down into a smaller series of targets could help me focus. To achieve that goal, what would I need to do? If I put in £850 each month and can grow my Stocks and Shares ISA at a compounded annual rate of 8%, it ought to be worth a million pounds after 28 years. As I said, this is a long-term plan. Becoming a millionaire takes time and effort. Looking for shares to buy So what sort of shares might let me achieve that average annual compound annual growth rate of 8%? I would spread my Stocks and Shares ISA over a few different choices, so that disappointing performance by one would have a limited effect on my overall performance. The 8% could come from either growth, dividends (that I would  reinvest ) – or both. An example of a share I own that I hope could give me both is  Reckitt  ( LSE: RKT ). It sells consumer goods, a market I expect to benefit from long-term customer demand. Thanks to its collection of premium brands such as  Vanish , it is able to charge a higher price for its products than unbranded competitors. That is good for profits. The company’s shares have performed weakly in recent years. In part that is due to a disastrous acquisition of a nutrition business and I see a risk that it will continue to dog Reckitt’s overall performance even though the company has slimmed it down considerably. Still, I saw the share price weakness as a buying opportunity and hopefully will receive regular dividends while I own the shares — and aim for a million!"},

However, the share price often declines first, but not always. One stock with slowing growth rates has held on to its elevated share price and now pays a chunky dividend. On top of that, it has the potential to launch into another phase of fast-paced growth. So it’s now a  dividend stock  with benefits! This one looks different Sometimes, shareholder dividends don’t exist with companies growing their earnings fast. Or if they do, the yield’s often low. So for growth stocks, it’s all about targeting capital appreciation via a (hopefully) rising share price. However, over time, businesses often run their course with rapid growth. Even if that’s just for an extended period until a new catalyst comes along to reignite operations. Annual increases in earnings might decline then the  valuation  will likely fall to get in tune with the slowing growth rate. And in such situations, share prices might slip, or perhaps move sideways, for a long time. What we often see from one-time growth darlings is lacklustre earnings advances accompanied by a yield that isn’t worth writing home about. Sometimes, the quality indicators of the business remain attractive, but the share price action can be pedestrian – for a long time! But the company I’m thinking about breaks the mould. It’s  Games Workshop  ( LSE: GAW ), the miniature figures and games specialist. The share price rose by almost 1,500% over a four-year period from the beginning of 2017 to the end of 2020, driven by some chunky double-digit advances in earnings. Big dividends However, the stock now remains below its peak of around four years ago and the rate of earnings growth in the business has cooled. City analysts expect a modest uplift in earnings for the current trading year to May 2025 of just over 3%. That looks like slowing growth to me. However, the directors have authorised some big increases in the dividend over the past few years. Now, with the share price near 10,743p (26 June), the forward-looking yield for the current trading year is just above 4%. That level of shareholder income puts it up with some of the best dividend stocks on the market. There are risks here though. One is that the rate of earnings growth has declined so much it could easily move to negative percentages going forward. The business is quite niche and relies on an army of loyal customers prepared to immerse themselves in the figures and fantasy worlds created by the company. If the offer loses popularity, it would be easy to lose money on this stock. But what about the added benefits? Well, the company recently granted exclusive rights to  Amazon  for films and television series to be set within Games Worksop’s Warhammer 40,000 universe. If that arrangement goes on to deliver, it’s possible for it to catalyse a new period of rapid growth in earnings. Although positive outcomes aren’t guaranteed. We’ll find out more from the company with the full-year earnings release, due on 30 June. Meanwhile, I see Games Workshop as worth further research and consideration now. I’d weigh it up for possible inclusion in a  diversified  portfolio of dividend shares with a long-term focus."},

That’s in line with some of my favourite investment trusts. But what happens when interest rates fall? These are tough times, and I can see the sense in a Cash ISA now. If you just want to preserve capital with no risk, they seem ideal. But the Bank of England (BoE) will cut rates, sooner or later. And May inflation was down to just 2%. So maybe soon. A cash shift By the time we’ve had a couple of cuts, I can see a lot of cash moving back into stocks. And to reduce risk, I reckon  investment trusts  could be a great move. I go for trusts that offer wide  diversification , and aim to grow their long-term dividend income. City of London Investment Trust  ( LSE: CTY ) has been my favourite for some time. We’re looking at a 4.9%  dividend yield , which is in line with those Cash ISAs. The share price has picked up a bit in 2024, so some of that cash shift might have already started. Dividend Hero The Association of Investment Companies has a list of what it calls its Dividend Heroes. That’s the ones who have raised their dividends for at least 20 straight years. City of London is one. It does, I think, mean that if it fails to lift the cash one year, investors could dump the shares and we could see a price slump. But it’s managed it for 57 years, so far. The trust holds a number of  FTSE 100  shares, with  BAE Systems ,  Shell  and  HSBC Holdings  its top three. UK diversification Murray Income Trust  ( LSE: MUT ) has also seen its shares pick up in 2024. This trust has the same kind of aim, also going for a range of UK stocks. This time,  AstraZeneca ,  Unilever  and  RELX  are the top three.  And, right now, the dividend yield is a bit lower than City of London’s, at 4.4%. Double up? With the two so similar, why might I want to buy both? Well, it would give me even more diversification. And it would split the management of my cash two ways, and reduce my risk too. Murray Income’s run by  abrdn , while City of London is under the management of Janus Henderson Investors. This time we have a record of 50 years of dividend rises in a row. Again, a fail one year to keep it up could hit the share price. Better than a Cash ISA? The returns from these two trusts are similar to a Cash ISA. But they’re not guaranteed the way its rates are, so they’re not as safe. A Cash ISA does have the lower risk here, for sure. But when BoE rates (and ISA rates with them) come down, the higher risk of stocks might be worth it. For those looking for lower-risk stock market investments, I’d say investment trusts like these are well worth considering."},

I think the banking company attracts investors because of its low-looking valuation and high dividend yield. Yet over the past four months or so, the share price has risen by more than 30%. However, with the stock now near 55p, the valuation still looks low when compared to the wider  FTSE 100  index. Dividend set to rise City analysts following the company expect earnings to rebound by almost 17% in 2025 after falling by a similar amount this year. But the all-important dividend looks set to grow both this year and next. Set against those expectations, the forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is just above seven and the anticipated dividend yield is just over 6%. Meanwhile, the Footsie’s forward earnings multiple is about 13.5 and the expected yield is around 3.5%. At first glance then, Lloyds still looks cheap. And  other indicators  bolster the case for good value, such as the price-to-tangible book value running near 0.89. A reading of one would means the stock price matches the value of the underlying assets. So the Lloyds price is offering investors a discount right now. But is the company actually one of the best dividend stocks to buy right now? Well, there are some factors to consider that may mean Lloyds isn’t as cheap as it looks. One of the big ones is the volatility often seen in the value of the firm’s assets. For banks, assets include reserves of financial instruments held, and money others owe to the firm because of loans the company has made. However, in tough economic times, financial instruments can plunge in value and struggling individuals and businesses can default on their debts. The worst-case scenario? I remember the uncertainty surrounding banks in the wake of the credit-crunch and financial crisis of the noughties. Nobody appeared to be able to put a finger on what banks’ assets were actually worth. In a situation like that, the only logical thing for the stock market to do is mark down share prices well below the last-known asset values of banking companies. That’s what happened back then, and bank stocks plunged by more than 90% in some cases. But what now, while economies are ticking along quite well? It makes sense that the market should keep Lloyds and the other bank’s valuations pegged down. After all, we never know for sure when the next economic downturn will arrive. So to me, high dividend yields, low P/E ratings and discounts to tangible net asset value are likely to be a permanent feature. However, that can all go out the window if we ever see another raging, bubble-like bull market! Banks stocks have flown before, and Lloyds may continue rising now. After all, forecasters expect earnings to rise next year. Nevertheless, there are undeniable  cyclical risks  when owning shares in Lloyds. So for me, it’s not one of the best dividend stocks to buy now, and I’d seek dividend opportunities elsewhere."},

Chipotle Mexican Grill What it does: Chipotle Mexican Grill is a restaurant chain serving Mexican-inspired cuisine, including burritos, tacos, and salads.     By  Ben McPoland . I recently offloaded my shares of  Chipotle Mexican Grill  ( NYSE: CMG ). The restaurant stock has delivered some tasty outperformance for investors. As I write, it’s up 352% over five years. The company’s focus on using fresh ingredients sourced from sustainable suppliers continues to be a huge hit with consumers. In Q1, it reported revenue and diluted earnings per share growth of 14.1% and 23.9%, respectively. So why did I sell? Two reasons, really. One is the valuation is sky-high, with the stock trading at 69 times earnings. That’s much higher than the US market average, which is high itself. Second, I want to add to my position in  Pershing Square Holdings , the  FTSE 100  investment trust associated with hedge fund legend Bill Ackman. The fund has a large holding in Chipotle stock, which allows me to stay invested (albeit indirectly). Also, Pershing shares are trading at a 26% discount to net asset value. Basically then, I thought I’d take my gains from an overvalued stock to invest in one that looks to be significantly undervalued. Ben McPoland owns shares of Pershing Square Holdings. Kraft Heinz What it does: Kraft Heinz is a packaged food manufacturer. Its largest shareholder is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. By  Stephen Wright . I’ve recently sold my investment in  Kraft Heinz  ( NASDAQ:KHC ). I don’t see anything wrong with the business, but I found an opportunity that looked better to me.  The stock has a 4.4% dividend yield. Adjusting for withholding taxes, this amounts to a 3.74% return for UK investors (before foreign exchange fluctuations).  The company has been improving its balance sheet over the last five years and is now in a much better financial position. But I think there are better stocks to own right now. I’ve used the cash I had invested in Kraft Heinz to buy shares in  Games Workshop . I think the company’s lower capital requirements give it better protection against inflation. On top of that, I think the  FTSE 250  firm might be a better source of passive income over time. That’s why I’ve made the change to my portfolio. Stephen Wright owns shares in Games Workshop . Vodafone What it does: Supplier of mobile telecommunication services to individual and business customers in Europe and abroad. By  Mark David Hartley . I recently sold my  Vodafone  ( LSE:VOD ) shares after months of losses. The stock is down by almost 30% in the past 12 months and I don’t see a recovery on the horizon. Until recently, I considered the investment profitable due to the high 10% dividend yield but those dreams have been dashed. From next year, the dividend yield will be slashed in half, killing one of the stock’s key value propositions. The cut is aimed at turning the company’s fortunes around and it may well work. If Vodafone starts funnelling that extra cash into its operations, the share price could recover. After all, net income increased significantly in 2023, so it’s doing something right. If I see evidence of a recovery, I might just reinvest – but I don’t expect much for at least a year. In the meantime, I’d rather invest that cash into a more profitable venture.

Over the years, I’ve seen good investors, and bad investors. And an awful lot of average investors.  From the privileged position of being a Motley Fool columnist, I’ve even been able to interview some of the good investors — investors such as Anthony Bolton, Burton Malkiel, and Charles Ellis. And if you’re reading this, Warren, the offer’s still open. But what is it that differentiates a good investor from an average investor? Or a bad investor? Some quite simple things, actually. Good investors have a strategy We’ve all seen them. “Magpie” investors that just pick up shares on a whim — a Sunday newspaper tip, a share that someone from the golf club recommended, a supposedly hot initial public offering, and so on. There’s usually not much more to say about the resulting mess except to note the fact that it is, well, a mess. Better by far to have a strategy. And even better to stick to it. What might such a strategy be? Investing in growth shares might be one such strategy. Investing for income might be another. Investing for global diversification might be another. Investing in resources and energy shares might be another. And so on, and so on. Good investors choose metrics that match their strategy How are your shares doing? Ask this, and you’ll hear some awful answers. “ Dog Star Dynadrive is up 80%! ” they’ll gush. Yes, but all your other shares are down 10%. “ Not so good: the dividends are really, really poor. ” But what do you expect? You’re invested in growth shares. Some of your shares don’t even pay a dividend. “ The market seems very volatile at the moment. ” I’m not surprised: you’re only invested in three shares. “ My portfolio is up 30%! ” Yes, but over the same period, the market is up 40%. And so on, and so on. If you’re pursuing income, measure — and report on — income. If you’re pursuing growth, measure — and report on — that growth. If you’re only investing in oil shares, measure yourself against the overall oil sector. And measure yourself against the market, or against a relevant sub-sector of the market. Simply being ‘up’ is not good enough: are you beating the market, and by a reasonable amount? Otherwise, a cheap — and probably better diversified — index tracker might serve you better. The same with income: are you getting more — or less — income than you might with a reasonably low-cost investment trust, such as (say)  City of London Investment Trust ? Good investors are opportunistic Warren Buffett summed it up best: in the long term, the market is a weighing machine — but in the short term, it’s a voting machine. Meaning that individual shares — or market sectors, or even whole markets — go in and out of fashion, and experience buoyant conditions, or not so buoyant conditions. So when shares go ‘on sale’, these investors are prepared to buy. It might mean some short-term pain — and often does, in my experience — but market conditions, and market opinion, eventually change. Leaving investors sitting on assets bought at attractive prices, and income streams larger than they would otherwise be. I’ve noted before my opportunistic purchases of  Shell : £12.95 in 2016, and £13.40 in March 2020. They’re now over £28. And let’s not even mention the dividends. Good investors invest for the long term Good investors — as opposed to traders — are in it for the long term. They understand that investing returns compound over time. They understand that timing the market is very, very difficult, and that it’s often better just to take a long-term view. And they understand that it’s perfectly natural for the market to go up and down, and that it’s better to simply ride out such fluctuations. They don’t expect to get rich by next Wednesday. They don’t panic and sell out when the market turns down. And — wherever possible — they buy shares that are able to withstand economic downturns and adverse conditions. How long is ‘long term’? Longer than five years. 10 or 15, at a minimum. And because they’re investing with long-term goals in mind — retirement, or early retirement, say — they’re sanguine about an investment horizon of 20+ years. So there we have it Do you recognise yourself in the above? Perhaps not. But would you  like  to recognise yourself in the above? You know where to start."},

The reality is, though, that Buffett started out with no savings and no shares. He saved money from a paper round as a schoolboy to make his first moves in the stock market. The rest, as they say, is history – and tremendously lucrative history at that! If I had no savings and was targeting greater wealth, here is how I would apply the  Warren Buffett  method to my efforts. Understanding what investing is all about A lot of people consider investing as speculation. They buy shares in companies they do not properly understand, hoping the price will go up. Buffett’s approach is different. He sees a share as a tiny stake in a company (which it is). So he finds what he thinks are excellent businesses with attractive price tags, then buys their shares with an eye to  holding for the long term . By sticking to areas he understands, Buffett is more likely to know what he is getting into. That said, even the best business can run into unforeseen difficulties, so he always  diversifies his portfolio  across more than a couple of companies. Buying and holding That approach can make money in two different ways (though it might not – share prices can fall as well as rise). One is an increase in share price. Buffett’s holding in  Coca-Cola  ( NYSE: KO ) illustrates this point. He spent a few years building a stake in the soft drinks maker, with the last purchase made 30 years ago (Buffett really is a long-term investor!) As he said in this year’s letter to shareholders in his company  Berkshire Hathaway , his investments in Coca-Cola and  American Express  “ are meaningful assets and also illustrate our thought processes .” His Coca-Cola shares cost $1.3bn. Now they are worth $25.6bn. Both numbers are big – few people can spend $1.3bn on shares! But the key point is the price  growth  of 1,969%. If I had bought at the same time as Buffett, even on a far smaller scale, and held until now, I would also have seen the same share price gain. That shows the possible benefit of buying into a business with a competitive advantage in a market with strong ongoing demand, when its shares are on sale at an attractive price. Dividend machine But what about the second way Buffett has made money (and lots of it!) from his Coca-Cola investment? Dividends are never guaranteed. But Coca-Cola pays them regularly. Indeed, it has  raised its dividend per share annually for over 60 years . This year, it will pay shareholders including Buffett $8.4bn in dividends. The $1.3bn investment now earns him over $700m in Coca-Cola dividends annually. That is totally  passive income  – all he needs to do is keep the shares he already owns! Finding great companies to buy into Coca-Cola has a great business but, like all companies, it faces risks from waning consumer enthusiasm for sugary drinks to high energy costs making production costlier. Buffett has not bought Coca-Cola shares for 30 years. But I am applying his method  now  to try and find bargain shares to buy!"}
